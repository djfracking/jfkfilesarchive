Systematic Introduction of Military Judgement
By definition the neutralization or defeat of
Communist terrorism consists of the specialized application
of counter-insurgency operations by the employment of intelli-
gence; psychological operations; hunter-killer operations to
include jungle, mountain, air, riverine, border, and village
security operations; communications; logistics; specialized
training and equipment, and other techniques. SIONICS, Inc.
considers that the techniques designed by our Corporation to
neutralize Communist terrorism in the border areas of Thailand
is based on sound past experience in this field and would lead
to the development of a wide-spread organization and system
within the Royal Thai Armed Forces (PIAF), the Border Patrol
Folice (BPP), and the Thai National Police (TNP) to counteract
this threat throughout the country.
-
Establishment of system and organization to neutralize
the Communist threat cannot be accomplished without reliance
on sound and informed military judgement based on proven
techniques.
SIONICS, Inc. has pioneered in the development –
of these techniques which permit the systematic development and
usė in analysis and execution of military and technical judge-
ment.
The techniques and equipment developed for this purpose
are designed and operate for the "usual or normal" case in which
they will be used under combat conditions. The capability that
accrues from the employment of these techniques and equipment in
crue
unusual or peculiar situations should be considered a bonus
effect rather than an expected mode of operation.

IV. CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS
A.
General Concent
The purpose of this program will be to strike s
the Communist insurgents where they are rost vulnerable and to
mesh the operations of selected Special Operations Hunter/Killer
Teams into present Royal Thai Government ongoing Counterinsurgency
Programs based on the proven and historic causes of victory over.
the Communists:
Aggressive anti-guerrilla tactics.
1.
Removal of sections of the population thus
depriving insurgents of contact with the people.
Removal of the support of the population.
In attacking Communist terrorist vulnerability,
the Special Operations Hunter/Killer program will be designed
to operate against the enemy and concentrate on the following
categories of insurgent vulnerability:
1. Insurgent base area system which, although-
fragmented, is a coherent complex of combat, combat support, and
combat service support facilities and activities which embrace
populated as well as remote areas. In this, Special Operations
unter/Killer Teams will, in the final phases of the operation,
be directed to attack or operate on the perimeters of insurgent
base area systems.
K
—¯¯ 2. Insurgent combat units in avoiding prolonged
combat may use escape routes that will subject them ideally to
ambush by Hunter/Killer Teams. In this, the classic principals
of "the hammer and anvil operation" will be employed. Helicopter

should adhere to accepted principles of field experimentation
as appropriate; e.g., the evaluation should be an elaboration
of common sense and convenient ordering of evaluation matters
so that the Hunter/Killer Teams encounter minimum interruptions.
Upon completion of the Evaluation Phase the T&E
Unit will make appropriate recommendations to MRDC for continua-

Future Operations
At the end of Phase V the CTTT should have proved
itself as one of the rost effective counter-insurgency programs
Savailable to the RTG. As an example, in 6 months operations
the 72 snipers of the U. S. 9th Division attained over 600
confirmed kills, the majority of which were made at night with
the M-14 rifle/Starlight Scope/SIONICS-MAN-A2 suppressor combin-
ation. In effecting this admirable record, 1.37 cartridges
were expended per kill. At the current cost of 28¢ for one
National Match cartridge, this averages to 38¢ per kill.
This
is obviously an oversimplification, but it highlights an extremely
successful and economical rethod of countering communist terrorism¨¨
along the borders of Thailand.
As a final note, this type of operation is as yet
in its nascent stages. Complete operational techniques that will
result from execution of the 12 month NCTTT will undoubtedly
disclose additional and more effective techniques of killing or
neutralizing communist térrorists in Thailand and will contribute
immeasurably to bringing stability and RTG control into its
border areas.

Mr. Bruce Arman" BAKER ·
11372 Drive, N. E.
Blaine Village, Minnesota
Mr. Baker stated that he has been in contact with a Mr. MITCHELL 201-259910
WERBELL, HII of Powder Springs, Georgia.
Mr. Baker says that Mr. Werbell is in the business of manufacturing
weapons and delivering them by air throughout the world. Mr. Baker
understands that Mr. Werbell does this for the Central Intelligence
Agency.
Mr. Baker says that Mr. Werbell is a supposedly reputable man.
Baker understands, from Werbell, that Baker will have to get a
CIA security clearance to fly for Werbell.
Mr. Baker has served in the military. He has had some paramilitary,
training. He belongs in a "jump club" and now participates in
"freefall", etc. He has a Morse Code proficiency and a Radio
License Second Class. He has Spanish language proficiency and would
be willing to collect for us.
This man persists on pursuing me re this CIA/Werbell relationship.
I tell him I don't know a thing about it. It seems he has a smuggling
record when he was 17 and he's afraid this may keep him from getting
this Werbell "CIA" clearance.

Mima mounds.
In areas where the running water had
covered them for only a short time, the
mounds were big. Where the water flowed
longer, more thawing took place and the
moms were small.
A very satisfying theory. But as usual,
other scientists have picked flaws in it.
For one thing, they question if the area
had the set of climate which Ritchie de..

it is today. And they doubt if the prairies

in from the south, probably only ad

Gophers will not live in the shade of
a forest, so' instead of pushing on farther,
they dug in on the prairies. As a pro-
tection against predators they dug deep.
Each Mima mound represents what at
one time was the "territory" of an ancient
gopher family. When they built their
foraging tunnels, they kept on dragging a
little more soil back toward the home site
than they took away from it. After thou-

These services present Werbell at

is understandably reluctant to admit
having done so. He describes himself
in such terms as "paramilitary" and
"adviser," but acquaintances suspect
he has been in the thick of the fighting

Military Armaments may well be a
unique American enterprise. Nobody
else. WerBell says, is in the business
of designing special purpose weapons
on such a scale. A good deal of its de-
signing and manufacturing is done
under federal license. Silencers, for ex-
ample, are outlawed by the National
Firearms Act, along with nawed-off
shotguns, submachine guns and other
vestiges of Prohibition era gangland
wars,

a year, collected by the Treasury

Apparently the market for suppressors

Werbell, is firm is the only one au-

Werbell will not discuss the sales or

well. It has about 12 employees, includ-

A Military Profile
ITCHELL WERBELL is a short,
MITO
wiry man of 52, quick with a
quip and quite sensible until he begins
talking about communism or other so-
cial issues. He has the face and bear-
ing of a Prussian officer, an image he
cultivated by wearing a mustache and
occasionally a morocle. He often
dresses in military clothing of indeter
minate origin, and he embellishes the
image by talking in slightly clipped
sentences peppered with military
phrases. There is nothing phony in
this. WerBell has a strong attachment
to weapons and to warfare, and he has.
been around them so long that the
ideas and styles they foster are an in-
grained part of his personality.
He comes by both his militarism and
his anticommunism honestly. His
father was an officer in the Russian
Imperial army, even though he was
born in the United States. "It was a i j
tricky situation," says Mitch: "He was
a citizen of both the U.S. and Russia.
In those days you could do that."
"
The elder WerBell fought against:
the Bolsheviks, but before the collapse
of the czarist regime he wisely secured
an appointment as liaison officer be
tween the Russian and
Russian and American
forces stationed in the U.S. He lived!
in this country for the rest of his life,
putting his early medical training to
use in cancer research.

vertising in a department store. Soon
he was head of the department, and
soon after that he went on his own.
In the mid-'50s, WerBell pulled out
of his agency and then formed his
own public relations firm. "I'd already
been drifting into international PR,"
werBell says, "using my family back-
ground. I had tremendous contacts in
Europe, and I moved into the Far
East, too." How much of this moving
in was military, Werbell won't say.
but his business took on more and
more of what he calls a "geopollitcal"
flavor.
Before long. he was dabbling in
Latin American dictatorships. "Before
Fidel took over in Cuba, we were
working closely with Batista." He adds
Batista in power, although the U.S.,
with a grin, "Our function was to keep
Rovernment was looking favorably on
Fidel at that point."
From all this, even WerBell doesn't
know exactly how, came a passionate
concern about communism. "I decided
to devote whatever time I could to
anticommunist activities,"
he says.
"At first it was sort of a hobby, but
then it became my main drive in life.

The Heart of It
---
IN 1948, WHILE anticommunism was
still a hobby, albeit a paying hobby,
WerBell purchased the Dobbs estate..
He installed rudimentary design facili
ties and began experimenting with
weapons of counterinsurgency, weap
ons he believed had the best chance of
preventing Commanist takeovers in
the small, underdeveloped nations of
Asia and Latin America. "I realized
that in counterinsurgency. the pri

to help preserve them.
His first major paramilitary opera-
tion was in the Dominican Republic
during the 1965 revolt. He was, of
course, on the side of the government,
which was fending off allegedly Com.
munist insurgents; the United States
was on its side, too. WerBell wound up
in the midst of the fighting. He was
the second Dominican government
man to reach the Ozama River, scene
of the major battle.
Ellsworth Bunker, then U.S. ambas-
sador to the Organization of American
States, became highly exercised over
Wer Bell's activities and his hawkish
views on the conflict (WerBell opposed
a cessation of hostilities and establish-
ment of a coalition government).
Bunker considered· trying to toss
WerBell out of the country, but noth
ing came of it. WerBell's "independent
group"--CIA, Texas millionaires or

Mitchell WerBell was born in Penn-
Bylvania, shortly after his Russian
American father and his Scottish-born
mother arrived in the U.S. at the end
of World War I. His parents traveled as
good deal, here and abroad, and Mitch
traveled with them, picking up his edu

journalism from the University of
Pennsylvania. In World War II, he
joined the OSS, and served with a unit

.
There is his anticommunist argu-
ment, too. WerBell is fighting the.
Communist menace; it is a fight that ..
must be won and weapons are needed„
to win it.
Contrary to cynical opinion, Powder
Springs was not named in honor of
WerBell and his enterprise. Werbell,
in fact, stays as aloof from the local
community as possible. His house is so
well-stocked, it is practically self-suffi
cient save for occasional trips to the
grocery and liquor, stores. There has
been, from time to time, anti-WerBell
feeling in Powder Springs. WerBeil de-
clares, “The hell with it. Who cares? I
tell 'em 'I'm prepared to purchase their
property if they don't like the area.”
He does not suffer from loneliness,
however. There is a steady stream of
visitors and' customers, foreigners as
well as Americans. A few weeks s10
Werbell's son-in-law, an Air Force lien
tenant colonel, flew in from Ohio,
mainly to see what was new around
the shop; he hadn't been by it, several
months, he said, “and things chanite
awfully quickly ground here." The day
I was there, the colonel and Werle:1
swapped ideas on ridding the State De-
pártivent of no-win policy makers and
on bringing the enemy to Ila knees, or
Its grave, in Vietnam..
Werbell recalls with relish one par.
·ticular visitor. He came from the State
Department a few years, back, and ac-
cording to WerBell, he said, "The func
tions of the foreign policies of the
United States are the business of the
State Department in Washington, not
of
Mitchell. Wer Bell In Powder
Springs, Georgia.” -WerBell's reply?
"You can't print it. It was all in Anglo-
Saxon words." But that was the old,
swashbuckling WerBell. The new, low-
profile WerBell says with a grin, "My
present policy is that I agree with that -
theory completely. Period."
If actions to the contrary speak too
loudly, they, like WerBell's weapons,
can always be suppressed by the man
himself. Meanwhile, Mheh and his "In-
dependent group" march on,

nam, nor even in one of the sugarcane
fields of South Florida, where counter-
revolutionaries are wont to drill and
target-practice for yet another assault on
Castro's Cuba. Rather, he is sitting in the
upstairs gun room of his home in Powder
Springs, Ga., a 66-acre estate-armory sit-
uated amidst the rolling, red-clay hills
and pine forests 25 miles northwest of
downtown Atlanta. It is a place where the
pastoral air is occasionally shattered by
the flashing of a red light that goes on
whenever the electronic gate is opened.
by the staccato barking of machine guns
from the test firing range or by the pul-
sating roar of a combat helicopter hover-
ing low overhead on a test flight.
It is from this base of operations that.
it appears, Mitch WerBell has been med-
dling again, this time in the affairs of the
about-to-betüme sovereign state of the
Bahamas.
1
-
His activities although no one is
completely sure just what they entail
have prompted Bahamas Prime Minister
Lynden Pindling to denounce WerBell
and attorney Edwin Marger, an associate,
on the floor of the Bahamian Parlia-
ment. Pindling called them "internation-
al fortune hunters" with "designs on the
territorial sovereignty of the Bahamas."
Werbell's involvement in the Bahamas
- as an advisor to a faction that wants
the island of Abaco either to remain a
Crown Colony or to become a separate
nation when the rest of the Bahamas be-
comes fully independent on July 10
has also prompted some concern by the
U.S. State Department's Caribbean
Affairs Desk.
-
-
--
It is not a completely unfamiliar expe-
rience to Werbell to have elements of the
United States government at least con-
cerned if not outright displeased
with some of his free-lance foreign-policy
maneuvers. He relishes recalling how a
visitor flew down to Georgia once to give
him the message: "The functions of the
foreign policies of the United States are
the business of the State Department in
Washington, not of Mitchell WerBell. in
Powder Springs. Ga." In another
incident, a congressional subcommittee
questioned him about his role in an
aborted attempt to launch an invasion of
Haiti from South Florida.
The subcommittee, the investigations
arm of the House Committee on Inter-
state and Foreign Commerce, was con-
•
1
cerned with the role played in the inva-
sión preparations by CBS News. The net-
work was attempting to film a documen-
tary on the military coup being planned
by an alliance of Haitian and Cuban ex-
iles. The Haitians wanted to tepple
Francois (Papa Doc) Duvalier; the
Cubans wanted to establish an anti-Cas-
tro base in Haiti. CBS was steered into
the project by Andrew St. George, a free-
lance journalist-adventurer who also in-
troduced Producer Jay McMullen to Wer-
Bell in the process.
The network. after spending upwards.
of $170,000 on the proposed documentary,
Project Nassau, decided to scrap it. "As
it is," a CBS News vice president wrote
in a Dec. 13, 1966. memo, "we see simply
the non-adventures of a rag-tag crew next
to whom. Duvalier himself looks good, a
gang openly flouting U.S. law, in the end
to no purpose.
The answers to "why" WerBell got in-
volved are, in the language of the sub-
committee report, "at variance" with
each other:
Answer No. 1: ** I felt then and I
feel now, and I will always feel that any
effort or any activity that any American
can give to a group that is attempting to
kill the boil and cancer of communism in
the Western Hemisphere deserves every
effort. This was my fundamental reason
for going into it. This was why I agreed to
assist them and why I did everything I
could to assist them up to the point
where I felt the whole program was ridicu
lous."
Answer No. 2: "I took this whole proj-
ect as a rather entertaining comedy. I'm
afraid I approached it in this connection
and I continued to do so. I felt that this
was a very amateurish attempt at some-
thing which I didn't know really what
was going on, and it was an interlude of
entertainment as far as I'm concerned."
The role he played is also unclear.
From the point that CBS entered the sit-
uation in May of 1966. WerBell appeared
at various times to be a network consul-
tant, a CIA operative, a CIA operative
impostor, a leader of the invasion, a U.S.
government spy on the invasion, a gun-
minner and a wired-for-sound observer in
an attempt to shake down the Haitian
consul in Miami for $200,000 to call off
the invasion.
Suffice it to say that the entire episode
was typified by the fact that the 68-foot
sloop Poor Richard, a boat WerBell had
leased for the expedition, was repossessed
while WerBell and others had it docked
at the Ocean Reef motel in Key Largo.
"The boat never had anything on it ex-

in 22 different countries. If somebody said
to us tomorrow, "We need a complete gov-
ernment, from a minister of health to a
minister of welfare to the guy who presses
the buttons to make the elevator go,' we
could do it."
-
Just how much demand there is for pre-
-packaged governments or how much ca
pability Defense Systems International has
for providing them is uncertain. What
the firm would appear to have an obvious
'capacity for, however, is warfare. Its preși-
dent and chief administrator is WerBell's
son-in-law, Paul Routhier, a retired U.S.
Air Force lieutenant-colonel who also dou-
bles as the company's air-war expert. On
the staff are various other ex-military
tynes songing from a Marine sergeant to
several retired colonels. Among its activi-
ties, says Routhier, is the sale to smaller.
U.S.-approved nations of armament pack-
ages, including not only hardware but also
training.
What Defense Systems International
does not do, its principals insist, is to make
wars, or shoot people themselves. If they
did, they say, they could go to jail for vio-
lating U.S. neutrality laws. Nor does it sell
the guns to shoot people with, unless the
U.S. State Department approves, they say.
And the State Department isn't about to
approve the sale of any arms by WerBell to
the Abaconian secessionists. No matter,
says WerBell. "We have no intention of
arming Abaco in any shape or fashion.
Anyway, they have more arms down there
than we have here."
So why, then, is there a photograph
lying about of the Hon. W. E. Errington
(Eric) Watkins, a member of the Bahami-
an Parliament from Abaco, clenching a
cigar between his teeth and test-firing one
of WerBell's silericed submachine guns?
The answer may well be far from sinister:
as a tourist drinks beer when he visits
Busch Gardens, a visitor to WerBell's
house does not normally leave without fir-
ing off a clip or two through the machine
gun. It is an instrument of which WerBelle
is duly proud: a rapid-fire automatic
weapon that, when equipped with the si-
TROPIC - July 1, 1973

lencer, makes about as much noise as an
electric typewriter.
The novelty of WerBell's weaponry
aside, however, there remain the questions
of how WerBell got involved with the Free
Abaco faction, what he is doing for it and
how he is getting paid.
The leadership of the Council for a Free
Abaco appears to be composed of two mea,
Watkins and Charles (Cluck) Hall. Wat-
kins, the chairman, is a retired Bahamas
policeman and former Nassau resident. He
was elected to the House of Assembly from
Abaco on the Free National Movement
ticket last September. He she has
known Werbell for some 20 years Hall, a
Nassau TV- and radio-store owner, is a
direct descendant of the white Tories who.
settled Abaco immediately after the Amer-
ican Revolution rather than be separated
from the British Crown. He says he was
referred to WerBell through persons he met
while organizing a demonstration against
allowing Air Cuba to service the Nassau
airport. "The people I met there, basically
right-wing, were able to put me on to Wer-
Bell." Hall is secretary of the council.
With a budget that they will describe no
more specifically than to say it is less than
$50,000 and made up entirely of small con-
tributions from Bahamians, the group is
paying WerBell and Marger an undisclosed
fee through Zeta, a dummy corporation
founded solely for the Abaco venture. Why
it was necessary to establish such a
company is unclear. Of its name, WerBell
says, "I think it's Greek for war.
-
-
"
But just what the Zeta Co. or Operation
Zeta it's referred to as both is doing
for the Abaconian secessionists is some.
what uncertain. So far, there has been
some lobbying of Parliament in London by
Marger, a lawyer with U.S. lobbying expe-
rience and a background in international
law, but about as un-British a fellow as
there is. There have been some saber-rat-
tling press releases to the British newspa-
pers. There have been conversations with
Mad Mitch. And there has even been note
of the plight of the Abaconian secessionists
on the editorial page of the Atlanta
Journals three sympathetic columns
written by John Crown, a retired Marine.

it seems that everyone associated with WerBall takes gun in hand for target
practice at one time or another. Bennett Bintliff, chairman of the board of
Defense Systems International, plays marksman with a handgun
to the world of a fellow like Mitch WerBell.
But there it is: the hush jacket and the
monacle. The belt buckle that conceals a
“survival knife." The electronic gate and
the two guard dogs, a German shepherd
named Fritz and a Doberman called Mál
(for Evil). The electronic sweep by the two
phones to detect transmitting or bugging
devices. The Scotch whisky, poured neat
- no water, no ice.
WerBell drifted-into his present line of
work during the mid-1950s after a brief but
flourishing post-war career in advertising; ..
he joined and rose to the head of the ad-
vertising department of Rich's, a major、
Atlanta department store. He then found-
ed his own ad firm. His first step was to get
involved in international public relations
and anti-communism: one of his clients, he
says, was the Batista government. From
there, he eased into the arms and intrigue
business;
WerBell's talent for designing weapons
recalls that of Q., the fictional British Se..
cret Service armorer for lan Fleming's
super-spy, James Bond. At his Powder
Springs retreat WerBell has designed¨ a .
submachine gun disguised as a briefcase,
an effective noise-and-flash suppressor for
automatic weapons, a cigar that fires a ɛin-
gle bullet and a swagger stick that is actu-
ally a mini-rocket launcher.
Werbell's sorties into strife-torn arcas.
appear at times to be merely the business
trips of a traveling salesman whose line
happens to be machine guns. At other
times, however such as during the Do-
minican revolt and in Thailand — his pur-
pose seems to be less clear.
-
-
His gullet warmed by a few gulps of neat
whisky, WerBell will recount some of these
past adventures, albeit reluctantly and in
vague terms because of the new, sober
image he is attempting to project. But as
the camouflage outfit hangs next to the
dark suit in WerBell's closet, the flam-
boyance of the old gunrunning and tank-
riding Mitch WerBell every now and then
surfaces in the behavior of the conservative
geopolitical advisor. Mitchell L. WerBell
III.
"
While in London recently, as Parliament
prepared for the final vote endorsing Baha-
mian independence. Werbell let it be
known to a reporter for the London Daily
Mirror (circulation five million) that he
was: 1) four-square for the cause of the
Council for a Free Abaco, and 2) recruiting
British mercenaries "for a project I have in
mind." Abaco? "Who said it was Abaco?"
said WerBell. The fruit of the interview

-
was a front-page story headlined: "Mutiny
in Paradise. . . The Island That Wants to
Stay British
cenaries.'
"
…. A Call Goes Out for Mer-
-
Such were the initial tactics in the Bat-
tle of Abaco, a cause that, for awhile in the
British press, seemed second in anticipated
ferocity only to the Catholics-vs.-Protes-
tants strife in Northern Ireland. Joining
WerBell as a comrade-in-press release was
Lt. Col. Colin (Mad Mitch) Mitchell, a
right-wing House of Commons member
and a hero of the Battle of Aden during his
days with the Argyle & Sutherland
Highlanders. Mitchell, who was muttering
to the British press about-secret missions to
Abaco and the such, recently visited Wer-
Bell in Powder Springs, WerBell said.
While there are some people who admire
flamboyance auch as WerBell's, there are
others who don't. Among those others are
WerBell's former business associates, a
group of New York investment bankers
who bought WerBell and Bennett B.
Bintliff, an associate, out of the Military
Armament Corp. (MAC) that the pair had
founded. "He's been headline press all over
England, and we're just a quiet little man-
ufacturing company," said Rosser Scott
Reeves III, chairman of the board of MAC's
parent company, Quantum Corp. "He's a
loudmouth. Basically, when you're dealing
with a country, the country would like tu
see responsible executives who are discreet,
who will transact business not tell war
stories."

Reeves, however, says he doesn't dislike
WerBell he just doesn't want to be
associated with him in the arms business.
“I like him a great deal. He's amusing and
he's a character. But letting him run Colt
or letting him run MAC is like turning
loose a high-school hot-rodder to run
General Motors."
WerBell and his associates in Powder
Springs have now reincorporated under the
name of Defense Systems International
Inc. and have hired away several of MAC's
former weapons specialists. They are not
overly fond of Reeves and his people either.
"Tunnel vision" is one phrase they use to
describe MAC's preoccupation with gun.

work, public relations, international law.

Nevertheless, the U.S. government

after WerBell had gone home. ·Seven per-

against
WerBeil. Charges
however, were dropped on orders of
then-Attorney General Ramsey Clark.
-
WerBell now declines to discuss the
mechanics of how the charges against
him were dropped, except to say that he
was "in constant contact with the govern-
ment” during his participation in the in-
vasion attempt and that he “did nothing
wrong." In 1970, however, WerBell told
an Atlanta magazine writer, "When you
work for the company, they take care of
you.
"
"The company" is generally used as a
euphemism for the Central Intelligence
Agency - an arm of government WerBell
says now he has never had anything to do
with, except to sell it some guns. The
company he was talking about, he says,
was CBS. Over the years, however, Wer-
Bell has spoken often. of his association
with the Company. Producer McMullen
quoted WerBell to the congressmen as say-
ing he had "previous experience" with "the
company.” “And when I asked him what
company he meant, he said the CIA," Mc-
Mullen said.
"Everybody always gets that impression
about any goddam thing we do," WerBell
says. It is a conclusion that is neither
difficult nor illogical. It may not, however,
be accurate.

But what, then, was Mitch WerBell.

der-holstered rocket pistol, doing in the

was in the Dominican Republic that
summer of 1965 as government forces dou-
ble-timed it to the Ozama River? The
tanks were attempting to capture as much
territory as possible before a noon cease-
fire took effect; instead, they were beaten
back by ill-armed rebels at the bridge.
TROPIC—July 1: 1973
Or what was he doing in Vietnam in
1968, with what WerBell claims was "the
simulated rank of major-general” supplied
by the U.S. Air Force as he demonstrated
his firm's revolutionary silenced sub-
machine gun to a South Vietnamese gener-
al?
To questions such as these, WerBell's
standard reply is. "I guess I'm just lucky."
More than just luck, however, WerBell's
propensity for being in the crucial place
at the crucial time seems to stem from a
combination of machismo, the profit mo-
tive, a knack for developing sʊmis uuly rad-
ical weaponry and a plug-in to the Old Boy
Network.
-
“And don't you
The Old Boy Network
ever kid yourself that there isn't such a
thing," says WerBell - is the cloak-and-
dagger types' answer to the union hiring
hal!. It is a loosely structured help want-
ed-situation wanted grapevine. "I became
friends with a bunch of guys who are now
four and five-star generals," recalls Wer-
Bell of his days as an OSS captain behind
Japanese lines in World War II.
Memorabilia of the OSS days and sub-
sequent adventures hang in WerBell's
home and in his psyche. The walls of both
his upstairs den and downstairs "war
room" are decorated with dozens of hunt-
ing (upstairs) and military (downstairs)
weapons. Six unsheathed swords are
mounted on the door of the liquor cabinet.
Two glass display cases in the den, each
locked, contain handguns ranging from
standard .45 automatics to single-shot
assassination pistols. Daggers, bayonets
and throwing knives fill the in-between
spaces as bric-a-brac. Photographs of
short, slant-eyed generals hang on walls
and stand on tables. Between two wild boar
heads above the den entrance is a framed
certificate from the Vietnamese Airborne.
The biggest war souvenir, though, isn't
on WerBell's wall. It is in his head - the
way a man of 55 acts after more than 20
years of being in and on the fringes of vio-
lent conflicts. Some of it, obviously, is
affectation. Some of it is genuine. And
some of it just seems strange to an outsider

Headquarter's Traces on the Military Armament Corporation..
ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES AR: As Stated in Paragraph Three
Reference:
Port Louis 12011, 17 May 1973.
1. There are no Headquarter's traces on Dr. George A. Winkler,
but there are traces on the Military Armament Corporation and its
Board Chairman, Mr. Mitchell Livingston WerBell III (201-259910).
In 1967 WerBell organized a firm called SIONICS, Incorporated
(Studies in Operational Negation of Insugency and Counter Subversion),
.specializing in producing silencers. In 1970, WerBell Aged with
Quantum Ordnance Bankers and the new firm was named the Military
Armament Corporation with Werbell as Chairman of the Board.
2.
-
:
-
WerBell was born on 8 March 1918 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
He served in the OSS and was of interest to BKHERALD in 1959 when it
was discovered that he was involved with anti-Castro plotters in
the Dominican Republic. He was granted a POA in August 1959 but this
was cancelled in October 1959 when his information proved to be of
little value and it was suspected that he was using BKHERALD funds
to promote personal interests. He has subsequently attempted to
pass himself as LNBUZZ connected and as a BKHERALD employee. Mr.
werBell's lengthy 201 file shows a long history of his appearing in
areas and situations where he can make a fast buck. He is character-
ized as unscrupulous, a "wheeler dealer", and a promotor of grandiose
schemes. WOTACK advises that the arms WerBell offers for sale are
of good quality, but that the selling price is considered excessive.
t
3. In that Mr. WerBell is a WODUAL citizen, the above infor-
mation should not be passed to CGPAT/1. However, the Station could
inform CGPAT/1 that the Military Armament Corporation has an unsavory
reputation and, although it may have permission from NVIDEA to export
arms, it has no LNBUZZ connections and that any dealings with the
_corporation should be approached with extreme caution.

officer, and acquaintance of WerBell's who
was introduced to Watkins. There is also
some talk about approaching the Organiza-
tion of American States and the United
Nations. And about a referendum on
Abaco July S the day before Bahamian
independence - on whether to unilaterally
declare Abaco a free nation. “We are puɩ-
´ting to bear all our activity and friends to
tell the world. Here's a country that
doesn't want to go this way,'
says Wer-
Bell.

-
-
The accuracy of that assessment of feel---
ing on Abaco can be questioned. Many of
the Abaconians who originally opposed
separation from the Crown abandoned the
movement as fruitless in December, when
the British government decreed that the
all of the Bahamas Bould
Bahamas
become independent. Nor was there ever
complete opposition throughout Abaco to
the Pindling government and indepen-
dence: of the two Parliament members
elected by the island's 6,500 residents, the
one other than Watkins is a Pindling sup-
"porter and a backer of independence. The
impetus, for the Free Abaco movement,
both Pindling and Minister of Exterial
Affairs Faul Adderly have charged; comes
from outside the Bahamas. "I still think
that what they are basically involved in is
the stealing of land," Adderly said in a
recent interview. And indeed, the majority
of the people on Abaco know very little of
WerBell and Marger outside of what they
read in the British press.

Werbell says his motivations are strictly
anti-communist. A far right-winger
described himself to a newsman as "to the

right of Attila the Hun".
the Bahamas as islands ripe for commu-
nism. "Every goddam single symptem that
was present in Cuba exists in the Bahamas
today," he says.
WerBell's opinion of the Pindling gov-
ernment and of the Bahamas' political cli-
mate is one which many observers of the
Bahamas do not share. Although the over-
whelming majority of the islanders are
black and have become very assertive con-
cerning racial equality during the past de-
cade or so, the Banamas have been deeply
influenced by English tradition. The
Anglican and Baptist Churches, both con-
servative institutions, are heavily repre-
sented. And the U.S. government is
ardently courting Pindling as a friend.
But WerBell, son and heir of a Cossack
colonel, sees the rise of Bolshevism where
others see the peaceful emergence of a new
democratic nation. And the question is
whether or not to take him seriously as he
sits in Powder Springs with his bush jacket
and walrus moustache, talking of hiring
mercenaries and of naming a company
after what he thinks is the Greek letter
meaning war.
The State Department, meanwhile, is
keeping a close watch. "You can't write a
man off as a clown." said one source, "if he
has a warehouse full of arms. We take him
seriously enough to want to know what he's
up to."

association with the Atlantis Dive Center, Inc., ai,
florida, where Vilbur is employed and waere Henry has had
a working relationship for some time. The Atlantis Dive

about various ways they could make money.
Filbur told cenry
that he ("enry) could smuggle ars for Ninover to Abaco,
and they started discussing that possibility. Juring the

noted that leary did not pick up the naise "Bobo or Brown
until after they had mentioned a Special Forces major, at which
point Henry professed to remember his name.

enry also told Customs, when asked why he had
called BRALD, that he had telephoned the first and
was told by then that its information was not in their juris-*
diction and was given the phone number for HERALD. Later,
Tenry chanced his story to the effect that he said he looked
in the Miami telephone directory to get the FBI's number and
called RALD (ODI) instead because the latter's number
was under the FBI's. (Comment. Not true, both numbers are
listed under J.S. Government but on separate pages.)

is an alias used by one John Wilbur, who is about 35 years
old.
Originally fro.. 'assachusetts, ilbur has been in Florida

approximately three years. He was initially brought to
Custons' attention over a narcotics case: At the time,
Tilbur was working/infor ing for the FBI, infiltrating both
right and left wing youth organizations. e was also datia
an airline stewardess who was involved in narcotics saul

Wilbur found out about this illegal

example, they mentioned that Wilbur would read an article

Mitchell Livingston Werbell, III
10 March 1971
1. Cn 9 Mar 71 we received a long distance call, presumably from Powder
Springs, Georgia, from subject, who is an old and unsavory contact of this
office dating from 1959. Werbell has been involved in a variety of scrapes,
the latest of which concerned an abortive invasion of Haiti which John Greany
was very much concerned about a year or so ago.
"'
-
Werbell stated that the Department of Defense had just revoked his
security clearance on grounds of Werbell's "frivolous behavior" in the laitian
caper. Werbell stated that he intended to "fight it to the Supreme Court", as
he had always kept us and other elements of the US Government informed con
cerning developments in the Haitian matter..
3. Werbell asked if there was anything that we could do for him in the
way of interceding for him with the DOD, and we informed him bluntly and in
no uncertain terms that he was strictly on his own, and we could do nothing
for him. He then asked if it would be worthwhile to subpoena Bart Gonzales.
We informed him that it was up to his attorney to make such recommendations.
'x
4. Werbell seemed to get the message, and then offered to keep us advised
regarding an alleged forthcoming attempt on Haiti which is being sponsored by
Rolando Masferrer, even though Masferrer is currently incarcerated in a federal
prison. We told Werbell that if he wished to pass any information along we
would accept it hat under no circumstances should he attempt to elicit any
information on our behalf. He agreed that he would operate on this basis and
said he might be in touch with us again.
5. In view of Werbell's record we felt that this latest contact should
be a matter of record and that OGC should be informed of developments.

The Honorable Joseph J. Liebling.
Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense
(Security Policy)
Department of Defense
Washington, D. C. 20301
Dear Mr. Liebling:
Re: WerBell, Mitchell L., III
In response to your letter of 16 February 1971 concerning
Mr. Mitchell L. WerBell, III's alleged affiliation with the Central
Intelligence Agency, we have investigated the matter thoroughly,
and based on all the information available, the answer is "No"
for each of your questions numbered 1 through 6.
You should be advised that Mr. WerBell voluntarily con-
tacted a representative of the Central Intelligence Agency's
Domestic Contact Service in Coral Gables, Florida, and at
Mr. WerBell's initiation furnished voluntary information for
the period 16 December 1965 - 19 November 1966 with eleven
contacts. It should be noted that the function of the Domestic
Contact Service is to receive information which individuals
The office
feel is of interest to the United States Government.
is overtly listed in the telephone book under the Central Intel-
ligence Agency and, therefore, is readily available for contact.
If Mr. WerBell suggests an affiliation with the Central
Intelligence Agency, he is hereby authorized to divulge the
details of his alleged affiliation in the hearing so that he may
not use ostensible security as a means of avoiding answering
questions.
Sincerely,
Lawrence Reforster

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT
Washington Evening Star Article entitled "The
Story of CES and the Plot to Invade Haiti"
which appeared in the 26 February 1970 Edition
'
1. Subject article reported that a CBS cameraman,
James WILSON, had contacted CIA agents in Houston while
on a space shot assignment in 1966, and that the CIA had
informed the FBI, who called on WILSON and referred him
to U.S. Custors.
2.
WH Division has ascertained that on 30 June 1966,
a James WILSON called the CIA Duty Officer of the Domestic
Contact Service (DCS) office in Houston, Texas, and sub-
sequently related a story about a proposed plot being
staged in the U.S. to invade Haiti and overthrow the
Duvalier Government, and that CES had convinced the parties
involved that they should allow CBS to photograph and
WILSON
televise a Special Program on the preparations.
requested and received assurances from the DCS officer
that he would not be identified as the source of this
information.
.
3.
On 6 July 1966, WH Division sent a blind memö-
randum to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the
Department of State which forwarded a resume of WILSON's
The
story to the DCS, without identifying the source.
Remorandum stated that the source's motive for disclosing
this information was to alert the U.S. Government to a
potentially embarrassing situation if it were involved ·
in an insecure operation. The JNWAVE Station also passed
resume of this information to the U.S. Customs Bureau
in Miami.
4.
Except in connection with this report, there is
no record of any operational involvement by the Agency
with WILSON.

VH/7 conveyed the substance of your first

have both had recent investigative interest in WERBELL

2. Under these circumstances, WH/7 suggests that

those statements would be properly coordinated with
such other investigations as may be in process.

SUBJECT:
REFERENCE:
Possible Clandestinė Planning Involving Haiti
Memorandum for C/WH/7; Same Subject,
dated 15 January 1970
1. On 28 January 1970, Mr. Mitchell Livingston WerBell III,
Vice President of SIONICS, Inc., told TC Barney Cochrane, USAF,
that he had not been contacted by any interested representative of
the U.S. Government concerning the information pertaining to
Haitian plotting passed previously. Mr. Wer Bell said that his
reference to the plan being initiated in Canada is a blind and that
the plotting is based in Haiti. He also stated that he has been
approached to provide the equivalent of five million dollars worth
of arms to the group and that the plotting has French backing.
2. The above information was received from LTC Cochrane
by LTC Charles Williamson, USMC, and is provided to WH/7 for
disposition and action. This information, to the best of our know-
ledge, has not been acted upon by SACSA; however, Mr. WerBell
is concerned that no action is being taken or apparent interest
shown.

1.5 JAN 1979
MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, WH/7
SUBJECT:
Possible Clandestine Planning Involving Haiti
1. The Vice President of SIONICS Inc., Mr. Mitchell Livingston
WerBell III, contacted LTC Barney Cochrane, USAF, assigned to
SACSA, in early January 1970 and said that he learned of the existence
of plans for a special clandestine operation based perhaps in Canada
against President Duvalier's regime within the next four months.
Mr. WerBell said that he believes this effort has a good chance of
success since it is well financed and directed. Mr. WerBell conveyed
to LTC Cochrane that he is willing to reveal all that he knows concern
ing the organization and its plan to interested U.S. authorities.
E
.
2. The above information was obtained from LTC Cochrane by
LTC Charles Williamson, USMC, assigned to SOD/GB. SOD and the
Office of Security have an extensive file on Mr. WerBell who has a
long history of worldwide involvement in borderline and sometimes
illegal international gun deals. It is felt by LTC Cochrane that
Mr. WerBell's story is plausible and warrants further investigation.
Mr. WerBell's motive for revealing this type of information at present
could be an effort to relieve pressure on his firm and himself for gun
deals that did not conform to U.S. export control regulations and are
being investigated and warranta pending.
3. To the best of our knowledge, no action has been taken on this
information by SACSA.

Air Chic Marshal Dawee Chullasapya
Chief, Joint Chiefs of Staff
Supreme Command, RTAF
Bangkok, Thailand
Dear Air Chief Marshal Dawee:
Sionics, Inc. is pleased to submit this proposal in response to
the urgent requirement to neutralize the communist terrorist
threat in the border areas of Thailand. This requirement was
first brought to our attention during the recent trip to threatened
border areas of Thailand made by yourself, Air Vice Marshal
Manob, and Major General Prasart, accompanied by our field
representative to Thailand. Mr. Mitchell L. WerBell, IIL
This 'urgent requirement was of course further discussed with
you during your recent visit to Washington to attend the funeral
of General Eisenhower,
In consequence we have prepared a pilot program with the objective
of neutralizing the Communist terrorist threat in Thailand. We
have entitled the program "Neutralisation of the Communist Terrorist
Threat in Thailand" with short title NCTTT. In scope the NCTTT
encompasses live major phases and spans a twelve month program.
Basically we offer a proven program based, in part, on the out-
standingly successful. U. S. 9th Division Sniper Program in the
Delta of Vietnam. Finally, and most importantly, this program
is also based on Special Operations programs executed by members
of the Sionics organization during wartime, counterinsurgency and
guerrilla operations executed in South Asia, Europe, South America,
Dominican Republic, and Vietnam.
We have selected a team of highly qualified experts whose combined.
capabilities represent all the disciplines required to the planning
and execution of this program..
