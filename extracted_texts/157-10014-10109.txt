In compliance with the desires and guidance expressed in the
10 August policy meeting on Operation Mongoose, we will produce
an outline of an alternate Course E for submission.
The CIA paper
"Operational Plan (Reduced Effort)" will be used as the starting
basis.
Since this is to be a bare outline, to permit further policy
guidance to be developed, I believe the paper need contain only
a statement of objectives and a list of implementing activities.
The list of activities will be undor the headings of: Intelligence,
Political, Economic, Psychological, Paramilitary, and Military.
We will hold an Operational Representatives work session in
my office, at 1400 hours, Tuesday, 14 August, to complete the
outline paper for submission. Each of you is to bring 5 copies of
completed assigned work to this work session, to permit each of
us to work from a full ook of Couns.
Papers required from each of you for the Tuesday meeting:

control over this entire effort, it was determined that Division D, which is
in closest touch with NSA on procurement requirements, could best conduct the
activity. The spotting activity has now advanced far enough to justify
removing from the OOA category.
4. Operational Assets:
(1) Personnel: QJWIN is under written contract as a principal
agent, with the primary task of spotting agent candidates. QJWIN was first
contacted in 1958 through the Chief of the Luxembourg I. S. by the Chief of
Station, Luxembourg, in connection with an illegal narcotics operation into
the United States. For a period of a year and a half he was contacted
sporadically by COS, Luxembourg, in behalf of the Bureau of Marcotics.
Files of this Bureau reflect an excellent performance by QJWIN. In

MAR 21 1977
1. Action.
None. This memorandum is for your information.
2. Reference is made to our conversation on 13 August 1962,
concerning the memorandum of that date from General Lansdale.
Attached is a copy of this memorandum, excised from which are
four words in the second line of the penultimate paragraph on
page 1. These four words were "including liquidation of leaders.'
3. The question of assassination, particularly of Fidel Castro,
was brought up by Secretary McNamara at the meeting of the
Special Group (Augmented) in Secretary Rusk's office on 10 August.
It was the obvious consensus at that meeting, in answer to a
comment by Mr. Ed Murrow, that this is not a subject which
has been made a matter of official record. I took careful notes on
the comments at this meeting on this point, and the Special Group
(Augmented) is not expecting any written comments or study on
this point.
4. Upon receipt of the attached memorandum, I called
Lansdale's office and, in his absence, pointed out to Frank Hand
the inadmissibility and stupidity of putting this type of comment in
writing in such a document. I advised Frank Hand that, as far
as CIA was concerned, we would write no document pertaining to
this and would participate in no open meeting discussing it.
I strongly urged Hand to recommend to Lansdale that he excise
the phrase in question from all copies of this memorandum, in-.
cluding those disseminated to State, Defense, and USIA. Shortly
thereafter, Lansdale called back and left the message that
he agreed and that he had done so.

Project ZRRIFLE
R371
INVE
ON MAR
1977
1
:{
1. Identification: The purpose of Project ZRRIFLE is to spot,
develop, and use agent assets for Division D operations. Agents will be
spotted in several areas, including the United States, but for operational
security reasons will probably not be used in their countries of residence.
Present developmental activity is being conducted in the WE and EE areas,
but it is anticipated that this will be extended to other division areas. The
project will be operated against third-country installations and personnel.
2. Objectives: The objective of this project is the procurement of
code and cipher materials, and information concerning such materials,
in accordance with requirements levied on the Clandestine Services,
primarily by the National Security Agency. Since these requirements are
subject to frequent revision, no listing of targets would be valid for the
duration of the project. Specific operations will be mounted on the basis of
need and opportunity. The project will be conducted by Division D with
assistance from area divisions and stations as needed.
3. Background: In response to the increasing requirements for the
operational procurement of foreign code and cipher materials, Division D
in 1960 began the spotting of agent assets as a developmental activity.
During the same period requirements from NSA became more refined and in
many respects more sensitive. Because most stations are not equipped to
conduct this type of operation and because of the desirability of completely

drafting of an outline of intelligence, political,
economic, and paramilitary activities for the
implementation of MONGOOSE. The task includes
planning for "splitting the regime, including liquida-
tion of leaders"
