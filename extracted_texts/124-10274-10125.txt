"That the National Office of WONAAC pledged
$1,500 to the defense of the seven women arrested in
Chicago because of their alleged activity in abortion
counselling, referral, and procedure...

"That the WONAAC National Office maintain,“-
at all times, a fund-raising staff efficient enough
to meet the needs of the emergency fund at the same
time it raises sufficient capital to maintain the daily
expenses of the National Office and staff...

Confidential source number two related that the
evening plenary session of WONAAC occurred on July 15, 1972,
and it was immediately apparent that the Socialist
Workers Party - Young Socialist Alliance (SWP-YSA) group
dominated the meeting. Independent women who wanted to make
statements during this session were voted down by SWP floor
leaders and these same persons continued to vote as a bloc
on all issues.
The group of independent women from various geogra-
phic areas, that is those women who were not associated with the
SWP or YSA, went together after the plenary session was adjourned
and considered the problem of how to handle the SWP leaders.
While these women were not political realists in their goals,
they did believe in working throughout the existing system
rather than functioning with the SWP in their eventual goal
of revolution.
It was decided that the independent feminists would
no longer continue hassling within WONAAC. They did not want
to have decisions for them being structured by a male dominated
group. They also decided that money being collected by WONAAC
in the name of abortion law change was not being used for that
purpose, but rather to sustain members of the SWP-YSA.
The Sunday morning session, July 16, 1972, was
labeled "Meeting to Discuss Internal Hassles." About 35
independents attended and a few number of SWP-YSA members and
sympathizers were present. Independents there were from New
Haven, Boston, Detroit, New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, and
San Francisco.

there is also the concern that women new to the movement will
join in a mistaken notion that they will be furthering
abortion law reform.
Independents vowed before leaving New York that
they would try to publicize activities from the SWP in an
effort to prevent this.
As the youth organization of the Socialist
Workers Party (SWP), the YSA serves as the
main source of recruitment into that organ-
ization. The YSA is described in the masthead
of its official publication, "The Young
Socialist Organizer," as "A multinational
revolutionary socialist youth organization."
The SWP has been designated pursuant
to Executive Order 10450.

Referenced letter stated that activities of captioned
organization in Philadelphia did not appear to be within the
Bureau's investigative interest and, therefore, no additional
investigation would be conducted.
As you are aware, the Socialist Workers Party (SWP)
and the Young Socialist Alliance (YSA) play a major role in
Women's National Abortion Action Coalition (WONAAC) throughout
the United States. Although a source of your office claimed
he was not aware of any information indicating WONAAC in
Philadelphia is substantially controlled by SWP, four individuals
- whose photographs appeared in a Philadelphia paper, were
“identified as members of the SWP as well as WONAAC. Based on
this as well as the established fact that WONAAC is, for the
most part, totally controlled by SWP/YSA, it is basic that
the activities of this organization be followed by your office.
You are, therefore, to reopen the case concerning
captioned matter and follow the activities of this organization
for the purpose of determining the extent of influence and
control by individuals who are members of SWP/YSA and who are
acting on behalf of these organizations. A copy of your
communications should be furnished to the New York Office, office
of origin in this matter, for information.

The independents did not waiver in their firm opposition
to SWP-YSA control WONAAC. Six national coordinators of
WONAAC were independents and decided to resign publicly at
the afternoon plenary session. They also decided to combat
SWP control of the feminist movement through the various
publications,
FORMER MEMBERS OF SUBJECT ORGANIZATION
LIF
CAL
-The six national coordinators who resigned were Judy
Siphers, San Francisco; Ann C. Davidson, Philadelphia; Rose
Weber, New York; Vicki) Eslinger, Columbia, South Carolina;
Nancy Rolf, New York; and Ellen Shapiro, New York.
There were approximately 700-800 women in attendance ·
at the afternoon session. According to one of the SWP
NY
leaders, these women were from 31 states and three countries-
Canada, Italy and Sweden. The states that had more representation
than others were Ohio, Illinois, New York, and Massachusetts.
Most of the problems and differences between the
independents and the SWP centered around approaches to abortion
law reform. The SWP was charged with always having demonstra-
tions and rallies and never doing any work through the legis-
lative process.
The independents stated that they were tired of this
hassle and that they believed there were more effective ways
to change abortion laws than carrying placards in the streets.
After the independent women publicly resigned in
front of the plenary session, two other coordinators announced
they were staying on. One was Barbara Roberts, the other's
name is unknown.
Linda Jenness made a final plea for the independent
women to reconsider. The removal of the independents from WONAAC
has debilitated the organization and most independent representa-
tives will be going back to their own cities to work for abortion
law change in organizations which have no connection with the
SWP.
The concern still exists, however, that WONAAC will
be able to collect monies in the name of abortion reform and

PH T-1 advised on May 25, 1972, that Women United for
Abortion Rights (WUAR), 1115 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, Pa.,
telephone WA-2-0381, is the local affiliate of Women's National
Abortion Action Coalition (WONAAC) and that about two weeks ago
WUAR decided to change their name from WUAR to Philadelphia Women's
National Abortion Action Coalition (Philadelphia WONAAC) and that
they intended to utilize the same office space at 1115 Walnut
Street and the same telephone number. PH T-1 added that this
change was made inasmuch as the name WUAR was found to be unwieldy
and awkward and that it did not convey the group's affiliation with
WONAAC as well as the new name Philadelphia WONAAC.
An article in "The Sunday Bulletin," Section 2, pages
6 and 7, issue of October 31, 1971, listed the various candidates
for political office in the City of Philadelphia in connection with
the forthcoming elections. Photographs of the following individuals
appeared and background information contained under each individual
photograph indicated that all were members of the Socialist
Workers Party (SWP) and that they were also affiliated with the

PH, T-3 advised on January 14, 1972 that as of that

PH T-l advised on May 25, 1972 that it is difficult
to determine the actual degree of SWP participation in the affairs
of WONAAC in the Philadelphia area and that he was not aware of
any information which would reflect that Philadelphia WONAAC was
substantially controlled by the SWP. Source explained that the
abortion rights issue had frequently been discussed at many of the
recent public forum type meetings sponsored by the Philadelphia
SWP and held at the Philadelphia SWP Headquarters at 1004 Filbert
Street in Philadelphia. The discussions held on the abortion
rights issue indicated that the SWP felt that the capitalistic
system had used the dual issues of abortion and women's liberation
to keep women in a position of inferiority, whereas the socialistic
system being promoted by the SWP would be in favor of abortion and
women's liberation, and WONAAC would therefore naturally attract
members of the SWP to their organization.

TO ALL AMERICAN WOMEN,
I am proud of the fact that my first vote cast in Congress.
was a vote against war. It was the first opportunity for a
woman to vote because I was the first woman to be elected
to Congress.
I believed then as I do today that women are the ones who
must be concerned with the needs and development of the
human race. I have always fought for the dignity of all
for those of the present as well as those
human beings
of future generations.
I will continue to struggle as long as I live.
I hope all women will respond to the following CALL, and
join me in Washington on January 8, 1968, the opening

With highest hopes,

REAL letter to New York, dated 8/30/72, wherein
Albany asked to be advised of any active investigation being
conducted re WONAAC, or if any active investigation is
warranted by Albany, FBI.
For the information of the Albany Division, the
New York Office is the office of origin, concerning captioned
organization. The Bureau has advised that as the Socialist
Workers Party and the Young Socialist Alliance play a major
roll in WONAAC throughout the United States, and inasmuch
as information has been provided that WONAAC is, for the
most part, totally controlled by Socialist Workers Party/
Young Socialist Alliance, the activities of this aganization
should be followed, for the purpose of determining the
extent of influence and control. by individuals who are
members of Socialist Workers Party/ Young Socialist Alliance,
and who are acting on behalf of these organizations.
Based upon Bureau instructions, in light of
information set forth in referenced Albany letter, concerning
DIANEXPARRY, an Socialist Workers Party organizer in the
Utica, New York area, and her reported communication with
national headquarters of WONAAC in New York City. It would
appear advisable for the Albany Division to institute such
investigation, as it deems appropriate to ascertain the extent
of Socialist Workers Party/Young Socialist Alliance activity
in its division in connection with WONAAC.

NEW YORK SUBMIT SUCCINCT LHM SETTING FORTH RESULTS OF CONFERENCE
IN ACCORDANCE WITH SAC LETTER SEVENTY-TWO DASH THREE (C) RE
REPORTING RESULTS OF SUBVERSIVE CONFERENCES.
NOTE:
WONAAC was founded in New York City 7/71 for purpose
of forming a national movement of groups throughout U. S. who
favor legalized abortion. This organization is dominated by
Socialist Workers Party (SWP) and Young Socialist Alliance
(YSA). WONAAC scheduled to hold conference at Hunter College,
New York, New York, 7/14-16/72. Detroit in teletype 7/13/72
requested authorization for DE 2831-S a valuable source who
has been paid under SAC authority, to attend national conference
in New York City. Detroit advised delay in submitting request was
due to lack of information as to whether source would be able
to attend conference. DE 2831-S is member of Detroit Women's
Abortion Action Coalition (WAAC) and has furnished coverage on
SWP influence in her chapter, and she has been successful in
thwarting complete SWP takeover. Based on informant's position
to discuss with persons in leadership capacity matters concerning
SWP infiltration of WONAAC, it appears highly desirable for
source to attend WONAAC conference in New York City. Detroit
being authorized to advance source $135 in connection with
travel to this conference. Detroit and New York also instructed
to coordinate re source maintaining contact with New York and
to insure FD-306 submitted and LHM submitted setting forth
results of conference in accordance with SAC Letter 72-3 (C)
re reporting results of subversive conferences. Source is
second out-of-town informant to attend this conference.

The Bureau, by routing slip dated March 6, 1972,
advised that because of Socialist Workers Party (SWP) leader-
ship and interest in the above organization, this case was
to be kept in a pending status and its activities followed.
In accordance with the above instructions, the
Bureau is being furnished the original and five (5) copies
of a letterhead memorandum prepared under the title, "Minnesota
Women's Abortion Action Coalition."
The enclosed letterhead memorandum is classified
confidential because it contains information from MP T-1

reasonably result in compromising the identity of the source
and, therefore, impair the national defense interests of the
United States.

October 21, 1972. The International Tribunal would be
held in New York City, New York, and it was hoped that
plans could be made for a local tribunal scheduled to be
held October 13, 1972, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, after
which individuals would be designated to attend the inter-
national meeting scheduled for New York City. This July,
1972, meeting was the first activity on the part of the
MWAAC as a non-organized effort following the May 6, 1972,
rally.:

11
Individuals known to be involved in the women's
liberation movement in the Twin Cities area of Minneapolis
and St. Paul, Minnesota, have, during the past six months,
shown little or no interest in the organization known as the
MWAAC. Former leaders in the women's liberation movement
have become aware of the SWP influence among the leaders of
the group, and have adopted a hands off policy from active
participation in the affairs of this group. While the
May 6, 1972, rally in St. Paul, Minnesota, was attended by
some 200 individuals, their attendance was considered to be
due to individual interest in the abortion issue.

SWP INFLUENCE
The MWAAC is not a committee of the TCB-SWP, nor
is it a part of the YSA-TCG. Women's liberation is a topic
of general interest and concern to the membership of the
TCB-SWP, and the anti-abortion standard taken by MWAAC is
one aspect of the women's liberation movement of continued
interest.

Members of the YSA-TCG have in the past, expressed
interest in the support of women's liberation as a matter of
policy. The anti-abortion, or so called legal abortion
movement, is one aspect of this women's liberation movement
which continues to be of concern to members of the YSA-TCG,
both male and female. While the vast majority of women in
the State of Minnesota support either the repeal or changes
in present state laws on abortion, supporters of this repeal
or change also include professional women, medical doctors,
lawyers, municipal court judges, and individuals from all
walks of life..

Characterizations of Organizations
PHILADELPHIA SOCIAL SCIENCE FORUM COMMITTEE
A source advised on November 14 and 17, 1958 that a meeting of the
District Education Commission, Communist Party of Eastern Pennsylvania and
Delaware (CPEPD), was held November 13, 1958 at 3425 Powelton Avenue, Phila-
delphia. At this meeting, DANIEL RUBIN, the District Education Director,
presented a proposal for a series of forums under the nominal sponsorship of
the Philadelphia Social Science Forum Committee (PSSFC). The source stated
that PSSFC was merely a paper organization and this series of forums was
organized by the District Education Commission and had to be approved by the
District Committee (CPEPD) before being put into effect.
This source stated on June 12, 1959, November 5, 1959, and October 21,
1960 that the PSSFC remained under the control of the District Education
Commission, CPEPD.
A second source reported on October 9, 1961, that the District Execu-
tive Committee (DEC), CPEPD, met on October 2, 1961, and approved plans to hold
and to support a new series of forums of PSSFC beginning November 10, 1961, and
ending in May, 1962.
The second source on May 8, 1964, advised that the main purpose of the
PSSFC is to bring to Philadelphia well known speakers who have a pro-Communist
point of view. Included among the speakers each year are national leaders of
the Communist Party, USA.
The second source added on May 15, 1967 that the PSSFC continued to
meet during 1962 through 1967 and that it remains under the control of the CPEPD,

in New York City (NYC), details of which will be set out
more fully hereinafter.
As the youth organization of the
SWP, the YSA serves as the main
source of recruitment into that
organization. The YSA is described
in the masthead of its official
publication, "The Young Socialist
Organizer", as "a Multi-National
Revolutionary Socialist Youth
Organization".
The SWP has been designated pur-
suant to Executive Order 10450.

I. ORGANIZATIONAL DATA
IC
A. Origin and Scope
NY T-2 on July 21, 1971, and NY T-3 on October 1,
1971, furnished information that over 1,000 women met in
conference at Columbia University, NYC, NY, on July 16,
1971, through July 18, 1971, to form a National Movement
of independent groups scattered throughout the United
States (US) who favored and had worked to legalize abortion.
As a result of this conference, WONAAC was founded.
B. Aims and Purposes
In the WONAAC national newsletter, dated September 16,
1971, WONAAC was self-described as a nationally coordina-
ted abortion law repeal campaign including legislation;
legal action, and nationally coordinated mass demonstrations
in Washington, DC, and San Francisco, on November 20, 1971,
for the repeal of all anti-abortion laws and corollary
demands of no forced sterilization, and the repeal of all
restrictive contraception laws. WONAAC claims to reach
all women, black; Chinaca; Latina; Asian; Puerto Rican;
native American women; campus women; gay women; high
school women; housewives; professional, welfare, and
working women; young women; women from churches, political
organizations, trade unions, the military, and communities
across the country:

"There were many members of the SWP and YSA at the
conference, and SWPers and YSAers are among those who
have worked most consistently for abortion repeal and to
build the abortion conference..
#
NY T-5 advised on November 12, 1971, that a NY.
Planning Meeting of WONAAC was held at LOEB Student Center,
NY University, NY, on November 11, 1971, to lay plans
for a scheduled November 20, 1971 demonstration in Washington,
DC. According to this source, this meeting was completely
dominated and controlled by members of the SWP.
NY T-6 related on November 16, 1971, that the Upper
West Side Branch of the YSA planned to send a contingent
of its members to Washington, DC, on November 20, 1971,
in order to participate in the planned demonstration there
on that date..
NY T-6 stated that practically all the members of the
uptown branch of the YSA, NY, were expected to participate
in this activity.
NY T-5 related on January 20, 1972, that the scheduled
November 20, 1971 march in Washington was "crucial" to
all SWP and YSA branches in that it afforded an opportunity
for selling of "The Militant" and other SWP/YSA literature,
and also afforded an opportunity for "intervening " in the
action via distribution of SWP Election Campaign literature.
NY T-8 on February 11, 1972, and NY T-9 and NY T-10
on February 14, 1972, provided information that a WONAAC
convention was held February 11, 1972, to February 13, 1972,
at Hayden Hall, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts.
The general theme of this convention was "How to Win
Abortion Law Repeal"
NY T-8 stated that approximately
30 members of the YSA or SWP Boston Chapters were observed.
in attendance at this convention.

NY T-7 related on February 14, 1972, that because of the
de-escalation of the Vietnam War by the NIXON Administration,

anti-war work through the NY Student Mobilization

According to EATON, WONAAC does not maintain a
formal membership, as such, and financially exists only
through voluntary contributions. She stated that all
staff members, National and NY State, serve on a voluntary
basis, receive no salary, and get only a small "subsistance
allowance" which the staff has found necessary to supplement
with their own personal funds in order to get by.
G. WONAAC Affiliates
El
CAROL EATON stated there are presently 36 WONAAC
affiliates, also called "coalitions" throughout the US, and
that most states of the union are represented by an affiliate
or coalition.
II. YSA-SWP INFLUENCE AND CONTROL
OVER WONAAC
NY T-1 provided information on July 22, 1971,
that the First National Womens Abortion Conference was
held at Columbia University, NYC, NY, from July 16, 1971,
to July 18, 1971, which resulted in the founding of WONAAC.
NY T-1 stated that it was immediately apparent that this
conference was taken over and influenced by YSA-SWP members
who infiltrated the various conference committees and
workshops which were established to help formulate the
main direction the Coalition would follow in the future.
NY T-l stated that it seemed certain the YSA-SWP would,
in the future, dictate policy for this organization and
would be able to control the utilization of WONAAC funds.

On August 5, 1971, NY T-4 provided a leaflet

captioned, "What Every Woman Should Know".

which was published by Feminist Organization for Communi-

"The Womens National Abortion Coalition has
been called and organized by the SWP and its affiliate,
the YSA, including women supposedly representing Women's
Liberation groups, who in truth represent, first, the

C. Headquarters
On November 22, 1972, a Special Agent (SA) of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), utilizing a.
pretext, contacted an individual self-identified as CAROL
EATON at telephone number 675-9150, located at 150 5th
Avenue, NYC, NY. EATON, who stated she is currently a
National Staff member of WONAAC, advised that the National
and NY Staffs of WONAAC are headquartered at this address.
D. When Meetings Held
According to CAROL EATON, regular NY Coalition
meetings of WONAAC are held every other Wednesday evening
at Religious Center at New York University, 2 Washington
Square North, NYC, NY. EATON stated that most NY State
staff members are present at these meetings and at least
one or more National Staff members also try to be in
attendance. Other than this, state and national staffs
meet periodically, as business demands.

SWP and YSA. These women attach more importance to their
political movement than to the Women's Liberation Movement.
And when 77% of the women in this country are for reform
of abortion laws, there is fertile soil for a political
party to build itself on. The SWP/YSA realizes this and
is taking advantage of it.
On August 5, 1971, a leaflet
captioned "F.O.C.A.S." revealed
in part as follows:
G
"A nucleus of about eight feminists
have formed FOCAS, Feminist
Organization for Communication,
Action and Service. FOCAS evolved
from the Women's Strike Coalițion
(WSC), which the Socialist Workers
Party abruptly abandoned on May
25th in order to form the committee
for WONAAC. Since that time a
nucleus of women from WSC together
with like-minded feminists pre-
served the WSC in order to main-
tain and expand a multi-issue
action-oriented Women's Libera-
tion coalition in the NYC area.
Assisted by loans from supporting
feminists, the new WSC paid
back nearly a thousand of the
three thousand dollars of debts
incurred by the SWP women who
had controlled the old WSC.

NPAC was founded in 1970 by
members of the SWP. Its objec-
tive is the immediate, total
and unconditional withdrawal
of all US forces and material
in Southeast Asia.
"'
NY T-7 advised on various dates, March 23, 1972,
through October 17, 1972, that activities of WONAAC were
dutifully reported and included on the agenda at regular
meetings of the Upper West Side Branch, YSA-New York Local
(NYL) during that period.
NY T-5 advised on April 18, 1972, that the leader-
ship of WONAAC was then dominated by the SWP.
NY T-7 related on July 7, 1972, that at a WONAAC
meeting held June 27, 1972, at 706 Broadway, NYC, NY,
starting at 6:40 PM, it was announced that even though
WONAAC previously had accused various female activists
working along with them in the Women's Liberation struggle
of red baiting because of the stand they had taken against
the SWP-Young Socialist Alliance (YSA), at present they
are forced to work with these individuals to help strengthen
the WONAAC cause.
At this meeting, certain WONAAC staff members
walked out and voiced their disapproval of the meeting
being taken over by a majority of SWP-YSA members.
They indicated that the SWP-YSA has no right to be in a
policy-making position in WONAAC.

NY T-7 on July 18, 1972, and NY T-11 on July 19,
1972, provided information that a WONAAC conference was
held at Hunter College, Park Avenue and 69th Street on
July 15, 1972 and July 16, 1972.
NY T-7 stated that NYC was picked as the site of
this convention because this city is considered to be
the center of the most powerful anti-abortion effort so far.
Discussions held at this conference centered on
plans for (one)-future activity in the campaign to repeal
all anti-abortion and contraception laws and (two)-to
end forced sterilization.
A discussion was held concerning the attacks
being made by the Catholic Church Hierarchy and other
anti-abortion groups against women's rights to their own
bodies.
NY T-11 related that the evening plenary session
of WONAAC occurred on July 15, 1972, and it was immediately
apparent that the SWP-YSA groups dominated the meeting.
Independent women who wanted to make statements during
this session were voted down by SWP floor leaders and
these same persons continued to vote as a block on all
issues.
The group of independent women from various
geographic areas, that is, those women who were not
associated with the SWP or YSA, went together after the
plenary session was adjourned and considered the problem
of how to handle the SWP leaders. While these women
were not political realists in their goals, they did
believe in working throughout the existing system rather
than functioning with the SWP in their eventual goal of
revolution.
It was decided that the independent feminists
would no longer continue hassling within WONAAC. They
did not want to have decisions for them being structured
by a male dominated group. They also decided that money
being collected by WONAAC in the name of abortion law

change was not being used for that purpose, but rather
to sustain members of the SWP-YSA.
The Sunday morning session, July 16, 1972, was
labeled "Meeting to Discuss Internal Hassles." About 35
independents attended and a few number of SWP-YSA members
and sympathizers were present. Independents there were
from New Haven, Boston, Detroit, New York (NY), Chicago,
Philadelphia, and San Francisco.
The independents did not waiver in their firm
opposition to SWP-YSA control of WONAAC. Six national
coordinators of WONAAC were independents and decided to
resign publicly at the afternoon plenary session. They
also decided to combat SWP control of the feminist move-
ment through the various publications.
* 1

PA
The six national coordinators who resigned were
JUDY SIPHERS., San Francisco; ANN CREEK: DAVIDSON, Philadelphia;
ROSEXWEBER, NY; VICKIESLINGER, Columbia, South Carolina;
NANCY: ROLF, NY; and ELLEN SHAPIRO, NY.
There were approximately 700-800 women in atten-
dance at the afternoon session. According to one of the
SWP leaders, these women were from 31 states and three
countries-Canada, Italy and Sweden. The states that had
more representation than others were Ohio, Illinois, New
York and Massachusetts.
Most of the problems and differences between the
independents and the SWP centered around approaches to
abortion law reform. The SWP was charged with always
having demonstrations and rallies and never doing any
work through the legislative process.
The independents stated that they were tired of
this hassle and that they believed there were more ef-
fective ways to change abortion laws than carrying placards
in the streets.

EATON admitted there were some problems in
the past with regard to friction within WONAAC about SWP
and YSA influence. She stated, however, this matter, to
her observation, never seemed a serious one, and is quite
minimal today. With regard to the "walk out" of six
national coordinators at the July, 1972 conference in NYC,
she stated the walk out did not occur, in fact, because.
of the SWP/YSA influence question, but rather because
those who walked out believed WONAAC should be a "referral
agency", while those who stayed felt it should not. By
referral agency, EATON stated she means an agency which would refer
callers to a specific location or place where abortions.
could be obtained.
IV. PLANNED PROJECTS
Ui
CAROL EATON advised that WONAAC plans an inter-
national Tribunal march to be held in NYC, NY, from March 9,.
1972, to March 11, 1972. She stated plans have not yet been
finalized, including the exact location or site this event
will take place. However, she noted that SIMONE BEAUVOIR,
a Parisian, well known in the Women's Liberation Movement,
would be honorary chairwoman.

After the independent women publicly resigned in
front of the plenary session, two other coordinators announced
they were staying/on. One was BARBARA ROBERTS, the other's

name is unknown.

SEER OF SUBJECT ORGANIZATION
MEMBER OF SUBJECT ORGANIZATION
LINDA DENNESS made a final plea for the indepen-
dent women to reconsider. The removal of the independents
from WONAAC has debilitated the organization and most
independent representatives will be going back to their
own cities to work for abortion law change in organizations
which have no connection with the SWP.
3
The concern still exists, however, that WONAAĆ will
be able to collect monies in the name of abortion reform
and there is also the concern that women new to the move-
ment will join in a mistaken notion that they will be
furthering abortion law reform.
Independents vowed before leaving NY that they
would try to publicize activities from the SWP in an
effort to prevent this.
III. OBSERVATION OF CURRENT NATIONAL
STAFF MEMBER REGARDING YSA/SWP INFLUENCE
When contacted under pretext on November 24,
1972, CAROL EATON, self-identified as a current National
Staff member, and previously mentioned in this report,
related that she has been active in WONAAC since its
inception. EATON, while averring she is definitely not a
YSA, SWP, or member of any "radical group", acknowledged
there always have been SWP, YSA and "radical" elements
in WONAAC. She went on to state, however, that WONAAC
has never allied itself politically with any organization
or individual, including any of the political candidates
in the recent political election and, despite its diverse
makeup as too ideaological beliefs of its membership,
WONAAC is basically an organization which strives only
to the objectives for which it was originally founded.
To this end, she went on, WONAAC would accept help from
whatever source offered.

that WONAAC represents basic social change dealing with abortion
issue and considering recent U.S. Supreme Court upholding right

Re Philadelphia letter to Bureau dated 1/31/73.
and Bureau letter to Philadelphia dated 2/12/73.
For the information of New York, referenced ·Bureau
letter to Philadelphia dated 2/12/73 authorized a continued
investigation of WONAAC utilizing only established sources,
The Bureau further advised that the investigation was to be.
conducted in a most discreet manner and that no action was
to be taken which could in any way be construed as infringement
by the FBI on academic freedom at the University of Pennsylvania.
The case file of captioned organization has been
reviewed as well as all indices references to captioned
organization and it has been determined that while some of
the individuals associated with WONAAC in the Philadelphia
area are also known to be affiliated with the Socialist
Workers Party (SWP) and for the Young Socialist Alliance
(YSA), the majority of WONAAC supporters appear to be
individuals interested in social change rather than revolu̟-
tionary political champ 05
REC-5

vol 113
In view of the fact that WONAAC represents basically
a social change vehicle dealing with the single issue of
abortion rights and the fact that a recent U. S. Supreme
Court decision upheld the right to abortion, thereby reducing
the political value of this issue, it would appear that a
continued investigation of WONAAC at this time is not
desirable.

WOMEN'S NATIONAL ABORTION
ACTION COALITION (WONAAC)
During the latter part of February, 1973, a confidential
source, who has furnished reliable information in the past,
advised that the Washington, D.C. (WDC) Chapter of the Women's
National Abortion Action Coalition (D.C. WONAAC) is scheduled
to participate in an "International Woman's Day Solidarity
Meeting" scheduled to be held in New York City, New York on
Saturday, March 10, 1973, place to be announced.
The national office of WONAAC is located at
150 Fifth Avenue, New York City, New York.
WONAAC goals are self-defined as "working
on a national scale to make abortion legal,
to end restrictive contraception laws, and
to end forced sterilization."
According to the above source, a flyer distributed
by D.C. WONAAC disclosed that among those individuals
scheduled to speak at the meeting are; GISELE HALIMI, described
as a leader of "Choisir," a French abortion rights organization;
MICHELE CHEVALIER, described as a defendent in a French abortion
trial; and CLAUDE SERVAN SCHREIBER, described as a feminist
journalist and as a leader of "Choisir".
According to the above source, members of the
WDC Locals of the Young Socialist Alliance (YSA) and the
Socialist Workers Party (SWP) have been urged to participate
in the International Womans Day Solidarity Meeting.
As the youth organization of the SWP, the
YSA serves as the main source of recruitment
into that organization. The YSA is
described in the masthead of its official
publication "The Young Socialist Organizer"
as "A multinational revolutionary socialist
youth organization."
The SWP has been designated pursuant to
、 Executive Order 10450.

out that WONAAC represents a basic social change dealing with
abortion rights and that in view of the fact the U.S. Supreme
Court upheld the right of abortion, the continued investigation
of WONAAC at this time does not appear to be desirable and
should be discontinued. Philadelphia also suggested that
continued investigation of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP)
and its youth group, the Young Socialist Alliance (YSA), should
determine pertinent activities of WONAAC.
After careful consideration of this matter, the Bureau
agrees with the observations of the Philadelphia Office that the
investigation of WONAAC should be discontinued. However, in view
of the fact that WONAAC is dominated and controlled by the SWP, a
Trotskyist communist organization cited by the Attorney General
pursuant to Executive Order 10450, it is the responsibility of the
Bureau to investigate and report pertinent information relating
to the extent of SWP domination and control of captioned
organization.
Therefore, recipients should close separate
investigations concerning WONAAC. In the future, report above-
described information regarding WONAAC under appropriate subheading
in the SWP semiannual organizational reports.

Re Minneapolis letter and letterhead memorandum
dated 9/21/72.
The Minnesota Supreme Court on 2/2/73 declared the
state's abortion law unconstitutional in its entirety
based on the 1/22/73 decision of the U.S. Supreme Court
wherein it was ruled that the states cannot prohibit abortions
during the first six months of pregnancy.
The decision of the Minnesota Supreme Court has
resulted in several Twin Cities area hospitals in Minneapolis
and St. Paul, Minnesota, offering facilities and providing
necessary procedures for staff members to perform abortions
under these court rulings.
MP 2851-PSI who has furnished reliable information
in the past, has advised that the object of the captioned
group was to remove anti-abortion laws from the books in the
state of Minnesota, as well as in the United States.
On 2/16/73 this source further related that the
Women's Liberation Movement supporters in the Twin Cities
area have generally reacted favorably to the court decisions
relating to abortion laws and now that the principal object
of the Minnesota Abortion Action Coalition has been achieved,
the influence of its spokesmen is expected to decline.

Referenced letter stated that a flier was passed
out at an antiwar rally in Philadelphia on 10/26/72 revealing
that the WONAAC had moved to offices located on the third
floor at Houston Hall, University of Pennsylvania,
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and that the telephone service
for this office was subscribed to by the University of
Pennsylvania.
In regard to your request to continue attempts
to develop information regarding WONAAC, an organization
dominated and controlled by the Socialist Workers Party
(SWP), considering it now utilizes offices at the University
of Pennsylvania, you are authorized to continue your
investigation. You should, however, restrict your
investigation to determining the degree of infiltration
and domination of this organization by SWP or its youth
arm, the Young Socialist Alliance (YSA). This investigation
must be conducted in a most discreet manner and limited
to established sources. No action is to be taken by you
which could in any way be construed as infringement by the
FBI on academic freedom at the University of Pennsylvania.
It is noted by the Bureau that the above

information was received by your office on 10/26/72, however,
your request was not submitted to the Bureau until 1/31/73,
a period in excess of 90 days. Although it is recognized
there may be other matters requiring more immediate attention,
the delay in this instance appears unreasonable. In the
future, insure that these matters are handled on a more
timely basis.

Re Philadelphia letter to the Bureau dated 7/27/7?,

the past, made available information on 9/1/72, which reflected
that the various women's liberation groups in the Philadelphia
area were planning a women's rights rally to be held on 8/26/72,
at Rittenhouse Square, Philadelphia, Pa. The information
furnished by the source further reflected that the coalition
of women's rights groups which planned the rally for 8/26/72,
held a meeting on 8/16/72, and at that time they voted to exclude
the Socialist Workers Party and Young Socialist Alliance people
from participation in the rally on the grounds that they were
representatives of political organizations,
The records of the Bell Telephone Company of Penn-
sylvania as furnished on 12/15/72, by (DONALD V. POWELL (PROTECT
SOURCE), reflected that telephone service for the Women United
For Abortion Rights, 1115 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, Pa., con-
sisted of telephone number WA 2-0381, which was installed on

Belvedere, Calif. wrote
to Mrs. VIVIAN WILLIAMS by letter dated October, 1967 which
was not delivered at Philadelphia until November, 1967,
while WILLIAMS was in California regarding the court martial
of her son, RONALD LOCKMAN.
HALLINAN originally had wanted WILLIAMS to be at
the launching of the Brigade at a press conference to be held.
in Washington, D. C., on Veterans Day, 11/11/67, along with
mothers, sisters, and widows of men killed in Vietnam.
HALLINAN desired WILLIAMS to furnish her with the names of
mothers and wives of men killed in Vietnam who felt their
loved ones should not have been there at all.
N'
did
Since Mrs. WILLIAMS did not return until after
11/11/67, she did not know of the event, and therefore
not participate. Additionally
Additionally, she did not get around to
reading all her mail until much after she returned to
Philadelphia.
This was the reason the source did not learn of this
Brigade until December.

This investigation is predicated upon information
that the Washington, D.C., (WDC), locals of the Young
Socialist Alliance (YSA) and the Socialist Workers Party
(SWP) are playing a major role in activities of the WDC
chapter of the Womens National Abortion Action Coalition
(D.C. WONAAC).
n
(WF T-1, 12/6/72)
As the youth organization of the SWP,
the YSA serves as the main source of
recruitment into that organization.
The YSA is described in the masthead
of its official publication "The Young
Socialist Organizer," as "A multinational

statement against the war in Vietnam, Miss Rankin was deluged
with letters from women across the nation who applauded her

Miss Rankin places the Brigade in an historical context
as a continuation of the efforts of the Abolitionists, and the
Suffragettes, representing the best of American traditions.
What are you willing to do to save your son, your brother,
What are
your husband from killing and being killed in Vietnam?
you willing to do to put an end to the senseless waste of
American and Vietnamese lives?
We have written letters to our President and Congressmen;
we have taken full page advertisements pleading for a halt to this
war; we have marched; we have wept; wo have been ignored.
Thousands of women are willing to go to Washington to
demand that our President end this war now. In 1954 he said,
"I am against sending American G.I.'s into the mud and muck of
Indo-China on a bloodletting spree to perpetuate colonialism
and white man's exploitation in Asia," In 1984 he was. elected
to the presidency on the promise that his adrinistration would
bring peace in Vietnam. Wo gave him our vote. We are giving him
No More! As citizens we have the right to have our
grievances heard. We will be heard if it means a massive act
of peaceful civil disobedience to achieve it,

Will you join us to save the men you love from death,
and the country you love from shemo?

Women's Bail Fund
Unless otherwise stated, all sources in
this memorandum have furnished reliable
information in the past.
On March 30, 1971, a first confidential source
furnished literature, concerning the Women's Bail Fund, which
was picked up at the Upper Westside Womens Center, 627
Amsterdam Avenue, New York, New York (NY) on March 27, 1971.
The literature captioned, 'Women's Bail Fund" argued that the
Women's House of Detention, in New York City (NYC), should
not exist and that "the Women's House of Detention, along with the
prisons and jails across the country, is a weapon used by the
power structure here in America to oppress and exploit the people
of poor communities." It further relates that "Women have come
together in New York from many different organizations to form a
Women's Bail Fund for all the sisters inside the House of
Detention. The Bail Fund is also working to prepare simple
pamphlets on law because of the total lack of any legal
resources in the House of Detention and secure legal assistance
where needed." The address is listed as the Women's Bail Fund,
P.O. Box 637, Cooper Station, NY, NY 10003.
On August 26, 1971, the first source furnished
literature on the Women's Bail Fund which stated, "The Women's
Bail Fund is a coalition of Third World and white women who are:
raising bail to release women prisoners from

First source advised on October 15, 1971, that the
November 20, 1971, rally has received mixed support from
various Washington, D. C., women's liberation groups.
Several radical vomen's groups refused to endorse the November
20, 1971, action because they view it as a Young Socialist
Alliance (YSA)/Socialist Workers Party (SWP) Front which will
use these rallies to further its own recruitment drive.
Furthermore, they considered YSA/SWP to be "non-feminist".
Main support for the November 20, 1971, demonstration will come

Women must use their minds, their voices, and
their bodies to stop the killing in Vietnam; to do
less is to ignore our special responsibilities to
the human race.
#10,000 women have sat back and let their sons
be killed in Vietnam. If we had 10,000 women will-
ing to go to jail if necessary we could stop the war
in Vietnam. You cannot have wars without romŠA."
Jeannette Rankin made the above statement in
May of this year. Fifty years ago, as the first
woman elected to Congress, she voted against World
War I. She has consistently maintained her strug-
gle for peace, and at 86 she is as courageous and
vigorous as ever ´an inspiration to all women.
--
The presence of the United States forces in
the internal struggle of Vietnam is immoral and
illegal. There can be no possible justification
for our interference in the domestic affairs of
this tiny distant land.
This 86-year-old woman has stated that she
is willing to stay in jail until the bombing is
stopped. Not all women are free to join her, but
we can assure her that thousands of women will
march peacefully beside her. Some will picket,
others will go to jail until bail is arranged,
and others will stay in jail with Miss Renkin.
Every woman's participation is equally valuable.
We are confident each one will do the maximum of
which she is capable.
On January 8th, women from all over the land
will converge on Washington to demand the end of
this dishonorable war. He shall come as individ-
uals, or as organizations, but we shall join to-

like-minded organizations. WILPF has con-
sultative status at the United Nations on a
national and international level.
"What Does it Do?
"WILPF, through its local branches, sponsors
public discussion on such topics as disarma-
ment and world law, nuclear testing, civil
defense, Berlin, civil rights, etc. Through
its Peace Action Committee, WILPF initiates
peace walks, virils, and meetings, as an
organization and with other peace groups..

INFORMATION CONCERNING (INTERNAL SECURITY)
Reference is made to prior Los Angeles memoranda
dated December 12 and 30, 1967, relating to a proposed march
on Washington, D. C., by the Jeannette Rankin Brigade (JRB),
when the United States Congress reconvenes in January 1968.
-
Source One advised that the Women Strike for Peace
(WSP - see appendix) and the Women for Legislative Action
WLA see appendix) are the two major organizations in
Southern California working for the success of the January 15,
1968, activities of the JRB both locally and in Washington,
D. C. Subcommittees of the JRB have been meeting in the
headquarters of WSP at 5899 West Pico Boulevard, and WLA at
5889 West Pico Boulevard, Los Angeles. During the most
recent of these subcommittee meetings, held during the first
week in January 1968, at the latter location, much of the
discussion was related to proposed action in Southern California
by women who would be unable to travel to Washington, D. C.,
for the January 15th confrontation with Congress.
Minor changes in the previously announced schedule
of local activities for January 15, 1968, were agreed upon
at this meeting, as follows:
9:30 AM
Assemble on the front steps of the
Old California State Building,
First and Broadway, Los Angeles,

will be read over a public address

. this latter location. It is the
present intention of the JRB women
to go inside the administrative
buildings at the Board of Education
and leaflet women employees there.
At the most recent JRB subcommittee meeting,
Margaret Wright expressed her disappointment that no
organized civil disobedience was being planned for the
local action of the JRB. However, she added, "That's O.K.,
the police will force disobedience anyway!
11
} The main slogan adopted by the local JRB is,
"The Hand that Rocks the Cradle is Going to Rock the Boat,
With Our Vote." Picket signs that have been approved to
be carried in the local JRB demonstrations include:
14-
"You Can't Have War Without Women"
"Woman Power is Peace Power"
"Women Control the Vote"
-
It was announced that three different versions
"
of the local JRB "Call" would be distributed within the
next week. The three will be geered to Caucasians, Negroes,
and Mexican-Americans respectively. The monthly news bulletin
of the WSP, called, "La Wisp, for January 1968, has an appeal
to the WSP membership tojoin the local action if they are
unable to make the trip to Washington. It was also announced
that a $50.00 advertisement would be placed in the "Herald-
Dispatch, Los Angeles Negro newspaper, calling for the
support of members of the black-community. Three JRB
activists were to appear on local radio shows to plug the
JRB prior to January 15th.

COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF THE
WOMEN STRIKE FOR PEACE,
Also Known As
Women's International Strike for Peace
A source advised on May 14, 1967, that the Women
Strike for Peace (WSP) in the Southern California area began
its operations in the late fall of 1961, as an affiliate
of the national organization formed in Washington, D.C. It
is a peace oriented women's organization which is opposed
to the present American foreign policy in Vietnam. It has
also sought legislation which would bring about the abolition
of the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HCUA). In
recent months the organization has sponsored demonstrations
protesting the United States involvement in Vietnam and
calling for the complete withdrawal of all United States
troops from Vietnam. In the spring of 1966, it was instrumental
in originating and putting into effect a campaign advocating
support for "peace candidates" in the upcoming 1966 Congressional
elections.
The same source stated that WSP is a non-membership
organization and has no officers. The organization is open
to women of all political opinions who are interested in world
peace. It makes no effort to exclude from its activities
members of, or persons sympathetic to, the Communist Party.
and related groups.
The guiding force behind the Southern California
WSP groups is MARY CLARKE. A second source advised in July,
1955, that CLARKE was dropped from the Western Division, Los
Angeles County Communist Party (LACCP) in the Spring of 1955,
for personal reasons and not because of any political differences
with the LACCP.-
-
The first source advised that Southern California
WSP maintains its office at 5899 West Pico Boulevard, Los
Angeles. It receives mail through Post Office Box 19739,
Los Angeles 19, California.

WOMEN FOR LEGISLATIVE ACTION
A source advised on May 1, 1963, that the Women
for Legislative Action was formed in 1952, claiming to be
an independent organization dedicated to non-partisan parti-
cipation in legislative and civic activities, Its position
in favoring or opposing legislation.usually parallels the
position of the Communist Party and related groups. It also
supports legislation to abolish the House Committee on Un-
American Activities. Membership in the Women for Legislative
Action does not, of itself, connote membership in or sympathy
with the Communist Party.
Another source advised on May 11, 1967, that the
Women for Legislative Action continues to be active in the
Los Angeles area.

A number of our California women will join thousands
of others throughout the country in "ashington D. C. on
the opening day of Congress.. They are going to Congress
to: demand an end to the war, to help our sick society
at home and end the demands of the military.
This idea came about when an 86 year old former
Congresswoman, Jeanette Rankin, said: "If we had 10,000
women willing to go to prison if necessary, that would
end it. You cannot have wars without women."
We would like to raise enough money to send all who
wish to go. If you cannot join the group going to Wash-
ington, would you make a contribution so that those who can
go will not be handicapped by lack of funds.
Then, save a date on your new calendar. On Friday,
1
January 12th we will have a report on ashington given by
Leslie Parrish who will be one of the leaders of the So.
Calif. delegation. You will receive definite information
and confirmation by mail.
• If you are able to go to Washington; please call

IL
A source who has furnished reliable information in
the past stated that the Women's International League for
Peace and Freedom had circulated post cards in the Syracuse,
New York area, announcing captioned demonstration, which
would be under the sponsorship of the Jeannette Rankin Brigade.
Source noted that according to the post card, the
date of the march had been changed to January 15, 1968.
Source advised that the card instructed participants to
meet at Union Station, Washington, D.C., at 11 AM,
January 15, 1968, and then walk to the Capitol. Source
stated that no known organizations or individuals were
planning to attend from the Syracuse, New York area, at
this time.
A source who had furnished reliable information
in the past advised that the Women's International League
for Peace and Freedom is a movement which has its national
headquarters at the Jane Addams House, 2006 Walnut Street,
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; its legislative office at 120
Maryland Avenue, North East, in Washington, D.C.; and its
international headquarters in Geneva. It is an international,
inter-racial organization striving for peace and freedom by
non-violent, democratic methods. It was founded in 1915
and its first President, JANE ADDAMS, was the first American
woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize. It keeps its
membership informed on current problems through its
legislative office in Washington and issues its own
pamphlets, study kits and fact sheets. It sponsors
public discussions on such topics as disarmament, nuclear
testing and civil defense, through its local branches,
and initiates peace walks, vigils and meetings.

Dear Friend:
We are sending this letter to you and others from whom we have not heard much
recently, in the hope of re-enlisting your efforts in the Women for Peace
movement. It has been too long since we last heard directly from many of you,
and our meetings with those of you whom we have seen recently have been brief.
Of course, we know the paralyzing sense of frustration we all feel occasionally,
as we learn of the mounting horrors in Vietnam. But this feeling is only
temporary, and quickly gives way to activity. As women, we bear the major
responsibility for the preservation of life, and thus a major responsibility
in the peace movement.
Enclosed you will find an announcement of the latest national women's effort
for peace.
Several peace groups in Portland are cooperating in raising funds
to send representatives to Washington. We hope that you will also support this
effort, to insure representation from Portland Women for Peace.
The coupon
on the enclosed notice is for your use in this effort.
In addition, we will have a supportive peaceful demonstration
in Portland at
NOON, Monday, JANUARY 15th
Pioneer Post Office
5th and Morrison
We are asking participants to wear black, and to bring a black
(or dark colored) umbrella. We shall carry the umbrellas opened,
rain or shine. Placards (to wear) and leaflets (to distribute),
expressing support for the Jeannette Rankin Brigade, will be
available. We shall march around the Post Office block for one hour,
from noon to 1 p.m., leafleting as we walk.
+
We hope, if you cannot go to Washington, yourself, that you will contribute to
help someone else to go, and that you will also join with us at the Pioneer
Post Office at noon Monday, January 15th.
•
In addition, please let us hear from you on your ideas of what more we might
do locally. We have some ideas too, which we hope to share with you, and on
which we shall need much help.
Please get in touch with one of us soon. Your help, ideas, and efforts are
urgently needed.
Yours for Peace,

A confidential source, who has furnished reli-
able information in the past, advised on January 9, 1968,
that the Jeannette Rankin Brigade (JRB) planned on a
demonstration in Washington, D.C. on January 15, 1968, the
day the United States Congress reconvenes. According to
the source, officials of the JRB want to assemble on the
steps of the United States Capitol and present a petition
to officials of the United States Congress but the United
States Capitol Police has refused to grant them permission
for such an assembly. The source further stated that
attorneys for the JRB have petitioned the United States
District Court to grant an injunction prohibiting the
enforcement by the United States Capitol Police of a
Congressional ruling prohibiting demonstrations on the
United States Capitol grounds.
The above source stated that plans for the
demonstration still consist of assembling at Union Station
at 12:30 p.m. January 15, 1968, marching to the Capitol
where they will present a petition to Congressional
officials and also confer with various Congressmen and
will hold a meeting probably at the Shoreham Hotel
between 2 and 6 p.m.

JEANNETTE RANKIN
HELENA, MONTANA
TO ALL AMERICAN WOMEN,
November 27, 1967
I am proud of the fact that my first vote cast in Congress
was a vote against war. It was the first opportunity for a
woman to vote because I was the first woman to be elected
to Congress.
I believed then as I do today that women are the ones who
must be concerned with the needs and development of the
human race. I have always fought for the dignity of all
human beings for those of the present as well as those
-
of future generations.
I will continue to struggle as long as I live.
I hope all women will respond to the following CALL, and
join me in Washington on January 8, 1968, the opening
day of Congress.
With highest hopes,

►to use its power and the billions now wasted on war, to solve some
of the problems of our crisis-ridden society by seriously working for
petter and low-cost housing, more day-care centers, more jobs and
job-training, eliminating poverty and discrimination, and conducting
a massive campaign against racism and bigotry in our schools,

we devote ourselves wholeheartedly to it, we can force the administration to
End the War, and to change our foreign policies; to restore our nation to a
position of honor in the community of nations; to reshape American society

It was the first opportunity for a woman to vote, because I was the first woman
to be elected to Congress.
I believed then, as I do today, that women are the ones that must be concerned
with the needs, and. development of the human race. I have always fought for the
dignity of all human beings -- for those of the present as well as those of future
generations.
I will continue to struggle as long as I live. I hope all women will respond to

January 15 for capitol cation
-
SAN FRANCISCO When
American women petition the
joint session of Congress on its
opening day (Jan. 15) to end
the war in Vietnam, it will be
"the most important coalition
lof women ever formed," Mrs.
¡Vivian Hallinan, executive sec-
[retary of the Jeanette Rankin
1 Brigade, tole a press conference
here last week.
"There will be women rep-
ating the clergy, relentists,
professionals, and leaders of
"the civil rights movement,” she
'said. "The black clad women
will be led by Jeanette Rankin,
'the country's first congress-
woman, who is now 80 years
old."
The people's leaders hope
jenough women from the Bay
Area will join the brigade to
make a plane charter feasible.

rkne can be addressed to the
cal office of the Brigade et

ing congressional leaders, ask-
W
ing them to meet the women
at the capitol stepu to receive
their petition to put ending of
the war in Vietnam as the first
order of business for the new
session of the Congress.
Program for the event, as
finalized, calls for presentation
to Congress of the Brigade's
demands (see PW Dec. 16) and
then holding of a women's con-
gress that afternoon to plan
political action on a local sade
Unless Congress acts on their
petition, the women will use
Jan. 16 to see their representa-
tives and pressure them to sup-
port their demands.
"We are not going to do any-
thing unconstitutional," Mrs.
Hallinan said. "We are going to
petition Congress for redress of
grievances. There was agree-
ment at a meeting of the na-
tional steering committes to
give Congress the more
months to act. After that wo
will take to the strect: there
was agreement on this by all
thore concerned."

WASHINGTON, D. C., JANUARY 8, 1968
JEANNETTE RANKEN BRIGADE
-
Information was developed that in late fall of 1967
an organization known as the Jeannette Ranken Brigade had sent
out a call for a demonstration to be held at the White House in
Washington, D. C., on January 8, 1968, in protest of the War in
Vietnam. Jeannette Ranken, the Chairman of this Brigade, is
86 years old and is a former member of Congress from the State
of Montana. She first went to Congress in 1917.
The December 14, 1967 issue of the "St. Louis Post-
Dispatch", a daily St. Louis newspaper, in an article on
Page 10C, stated that Jeannette Ranken was planning a massive
Vietnam peace project by women who would converge on Congress
in January, 1968. She is elsewhere quoted to have said, "Tеà
thousand women have sat back and let their sons be killed in
Vietnam. If we had ten thousand women willing to go to jail
if necessary we could stop the war in Vietnam. You cannot have
wars without women. She has stated that she is willing to
stay in jail until the bombing in Vietnam is stopped.
Source One advised on January 6, 1968, that the
St. Louis Peace Information Center, at 6217 Delmar, has been
active in organizing interest in the Jeannette Ranken demonstratio.
It was announced that the date for the demonstration at Washington.
D. C., had been changed from January 8, to January 15, 1968.

Source said that in addition to sending a delegation to
Washington, D. C., the St. Louis group is formulating plans for
a demonstration to take place in St. Louis, Missouri, on
January 15, 1968. The Peace Center has distributed a leaflet.
A copy of this leaflet is as follows:

St. Louis has not attempted to characterize any of
the names listed on printed flyer that is a part of the LHM.
The names written in after St. Louis delegation are not known
to have subversive connections, although they are associated
with peace and anti-Vietnam activities.
St. Louis is continuing its efforts to identify
individuals who will travel to Washington, D. C., and it will
follow demonstration to be held at Clayton, Missouri, 1/15/68.
Bureau will be kept advised by airtel.

strike for
20 S. 12th Street Philadelphia, Pa. 19107 - Telephone: LO 3-4310
Dear WSPER:
Women Strike for Peace nationally is supporting the Jeannette Rankin Brigade.
Planeloais, trainloads and carloads of women will be coming into Washington on Mon-
day, January 15th, from all over the country.
We are particularly pleased with this action because it represents for the first
time a real coalition of women's peace groups, church groups, theatre personalities,
and community leaders.
•
The Day is envisioned as a solemn, dignified confrontation of those who should be
representing the ever growing opposition to the war. We ask that you write your Con-
gressmen urging that they support the four points listed in the enclosed Call as Con-
gress reconvenes. Later in the afternoon at our Women's Congress we want to be able to
report on Congressional responses.
We will all meet at Union Station in Washington at 11:30 AM and slowly walk to the
Capitol. We ask the women to wear black. We will be led by Jeannette Rankin who will
proceed to the top of the Capitol steps with a representative delegation of 50 women to
present our petition to the two men who represent the whole of Congress, Senator Mike
ansfield and Speaker of the House McCormack. The delegation will read the demands be-
fore the assembled women and the two Congressmen. Leaving the Hill, the women will enter
buses for a motorcade to a Congress of American Women (place to be announced). . Women
hill present an analysis of the current crisis on the war front and the domestic front,
eading to suggestions for program and actions to be taken back to our communities for im-
lementation.
Women may choose to remain in Washington the next day to meet with their Congressmen.
f you wish to stay and wish help in securing accommodations, contact the Hospitality Com-
ittee, 2140 P. St. N.W. Washington, DC (293-2020).
Washington, DC (293-2020). We regret that in order to get the
owest train fare we had to guarantee return the same day; therefore you would have to
inance your own trip back on the 16th.
Our hope is that 10,000 women will converge upon Washington. We urge you to parti-
ipate.
Yours for Peace,
Ethel Taylor

On April 12, 1971, a second confidential source
made available a flyer on the Women's Bail Fund which was
distributed at the National Womens March on the Pentagon on
April 10, 1971. The flyer, captioned, "Victory to the NLF and All
Oppressed Peoples" states "Women in Vietnam and in the United
States are fighting for the right to live: for the very right
to exist.....the U.S. is now dotted with concentration camps for
the poor and non-white: the jails.....But imprisonment doesnt'
break the spirit of the sisters in jail. They resist! When denied
their dignity, they organize and fight back. When one sister is
beaten they organiz and resist. In the coldest part of winter
when the boilers had broken down, the women worked in freezing
temperatures in cold water to do the laundry-not 'because the
pigs made us do it - but for our own beautiful sisters.'
Vietnamese, Black, Latin, White and Asian-american women are
united in our struggle - we share common goals and face a common
enemy. We express our complete solidarity with the NLF and shall
work to bring the victory there."

On May 14, 1971, Special Agents (SAS) of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) observed a demonstration in front
of the NYC Women's House of Detention sponsored by the Women's
Bail Fund and Youth Against War and Fascism (YAWF). The
demonstrators chanted slogans calling for release of their
"sisters" from jail and expressed opposition to a proposed move
of the inmates of the Women's House of Detention from its
downtown site to the Rikers Island Prison Facility.
The
demonstrators called this proposed move an attempt to isolate
the "sisters from their supporters.'
By means of a loudspeaker, the demonstrators called to
several inmates of the House of Detention who appeared in the
upper storey windows, obtained their names and place of arrest.
This information allegedly was to be used to obtain bail for the
prisoners in question. Thereafter, several speakers denounced
the jails as concentration camps and called for the release of the
"political prisoners." in the House of Detention. Among the
speakers was Shirley Taylor of the Women's Bail Fund and a
former inmate of the Women's House of Detention.

JANUARY 15, 1968
A confidential source, who has furnished reliable
information in the past, advised in December, 1967, that
the Jeannette Rankin Brigade (JRB) had been formed primarily
by members of Women Strike for Peace, a pacifist organization.
Members of Women Strike for Peace had formed the organization
following a statement made by former Congresswoman Jeannette
* Rankin of Montana, in which she stated that if 10,000 American
housewives were willing to be arrested, they could stop
the war in Vietnam. According to the source, the JRB was
formed as a "one shot organization" to sponsor a demonstration
in Washington, D.C., when Congress reconvenes, in 1968.
The same source advised that January 15, 1968,
had been established as the date of the above demonstration
in view of the fact that Congress was reconvening on that
date. The source stated that the headquarters of the JRB
was located in New York City and that officials there and
in other large United States cities including Los Angeles,
San Francisco and Washington, D.C., were formulating the
plans for a "march on the United States Capitol" where
the women would present to the United States Congress a
petition demanding that the Congressmen end the war in
Vietnam. The source stated that a small minority in the
above organization were in favor of commiting acts of civil
disobedience and being arrested but the vast majority of
the organization wanted a peaceful demonstration to again
focus the Congressional attention upon the war in Vietnam.
The same source advised in January, 1968, that
representatives of the JRB met with officials of the United
States Capitol Police on several occasions and attempted
to gain permission to assemble on the steps of the United
States Capitol and present a petition to Congressional

demonstrations on the United States Capitol grounds. The..
source advised on January 12, 1968, that a final meeting
with the United States Capitol Police officials had been
held and it had been decided by the representatives of
the JRB that the women would assemble at Union Station
at approximately 11:30 a.m. and march to Union Square.
located at the foot of Capitol Hill off the Capitol
grounds. Officials of the JRB obtained a permit from the
United States Park Police granting them permission to use
an area in the vicinity of Union Square for assembling and
hearing the reading of the petition which was to be;

The source advised on January 12, 1968, that
the JRB had rented the Regency Ballroom of the Shoreham
Hotel, Calvert Street, N.W., Washington, D.C., from 2 to
6 p.m. on January 15, 1968. After meeting on Union
Square, the group will travel by bus to the Shoreham
Hotel where they will hold a Congress of American Women.
After 6 p.m. they will be bused to Union Station where they
will depart Washington, D.C.
Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investi-
gation on January 15, 1968, at approximately 11:30 a.m.
observed several hundred people assembled in Union Station
apparently waiting to participate in the JRB demonstration
at that time. At approximately 11:40 a.m. a train bound
from New York City to Washington, D.C., arrived at Union
Station with approximately 1,500 individuals, mostly women,
aboard. These individuals began marching at twelve noon
away from Union Station, South on Louisiana Avenue. Now
numbering approximately 2,600, they marched six abreast
on the West sidewalk of Louisiana Avenue to the vicinity
of Union Square where they began arriving at approximately
12:35 p.m.

Just prior to the opening of the above program,
a group entitled "Radical Women's Group from New York"
put on a skit which included the bringing in of a stretcher
indicating that it was the body of a dead soldier. On
the stretcher was a telegram of regrets and it was stated
that there would later be a mock burial of the above
"corpse."

The program of the Congress of American Women
began with Pearl Willen of New York acting as the presiding
officer. She made announcements to the effect that there
was much literature on the tables and that workshops would
be held both tonight and the following day. She welcomed
representatives from forty states to the gathering and
stated that they now need to go from the great society
to the just society. Mrs. Willen introduced the two
Co-Chairmen of the Congress as Mrs. Coretta King of
Georgia and Mrs. Mary Clark of Los Angeles, California,
who were both present and acknowledged the introduction.
The first speaker on the program was Mrs. Vivian
Hallinan of San Francisco, California, who described the
development of the coalition of women which had developed
into the JRB. She said the JRB had been conceived in
California last year after the statement by Mrs. Rankin
concerning what the women could do to stop the war.
Hallinan described the JRB's goal as "world without war"
and "life with dignity and opportunities to develop our
maximum capacity.'
The next speaker on the program was Mrs. Martin
Luther King, Jr., who was initially introduced as Coretta
King. Mrs. King stated that she was greatly encouraged by
the growth of the peace movement and that she was totally
opposed to the brutal slaughter in Vietnam. She stated that
the women must use all of their power to stop that war.

The following individuals were preceded by
several individuals carrying a large banner which read:
"End the War in Vietnam and Social Crisis at Home." Prior
to leaving Union Station, many small placards were observed,
some of which read: "End the War" and "LBJ Eats Imperial
Margarine." These placards were removed from the demonstration
when the participants were advised they would only be
allowed to carry a large banner in front and a large banner
in the rear of the marchers. The banner bringing up the
rear of the marchers read as follows: "U.S. Women Unite
End the War in Vietnam. Before the participants began
marching, one Amy Swerdlow of New York City, acting as
spokesman for the group, stated that a delegation of
fifteen women were going by car to present their petition
to the United States Congress while the rest of them
would walk to Union Square where the petition will be
read to them by Viveca Lindfors. After the reading of
this petition, the participants were instructed to board
buses which were located near Union Square and they would
be transported to the Shoreham Hotel.
All of the participants had arrived at Union
Square by approximately 1 p.m. and it was estimated by
police officials that approximately 2,600 individuals had
taken part in the march. Small placards had been observed
in Union Station which showed representatives there from
the following locations:

She stated that the men had gotten us into this war and
had made a complete mess of it. She stated that there is
a need to end the war so that we may tend to the needs of
people in urban ghetto areas. Injustice in our society
must be taken care of and she described the present
challenges as "militarism, racism and wantonism." She
stated there can be no justice at home until there is
no war in the world. She concluded by reading a poem
entitled "Life Ain't Been No Crystal Stair."
Jeannette Rankin was the next speaker and she
welcomed everyone expressing great joy that so many women
had gathered together for peace. She stated that our
forefathers wrote the constitution in such a way so that
the military could not take over control of this Govern-
ment. She was apparently implying that the military system
is running the United States. She stated that the women
must see that the military system is destroyed. She
demanded that women have a secret ballot in the election
as well as a choice in selecting candidates. She concluded
by recommending that women everywhere become candidates
for political offices.
The next speaker was Katherine Camp from Pennsylvania
described as the President of the Women's International
League for Peace and Freedom. Mrs. Camp described the
activities of the fifteen women delegation that went to
Congress on this date. She stated that they presented a
petition to Speaker of the House McCormick and that he had
assured them that it would be acted on as any other petition
presented to Congress. Camp stated that the Speaker left
then as he was called by a bell to the floor of the
Congress. Camp stated that following this, Mrs. Rankin,
her sister Edna McKinon, and niece Mrs. Dorothy Brown,
visited Senator Mike Mansfield and presented him with a
petition.

while the main meeting was being held in the Ambassador
Room of the Shoreham Hotel, a group called the Radical

YOUNG SOCIALIST ALLIANCE
COPESSENTIAL
The May, 1960, issue of the "Young Socialist" (YS),
page 1, column 3, disclosed that during April 15-17, 1960, a
national organization entitled "The Young Socialist Alliance“
(YSA) was established at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This issue
stated that this organization was formed by the nationwide
supporter clubs of the publication US.
The above issue, page 6, set forth the Founding
Declaration of the YSA. This declaration stated that the YSA
recognized the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) as the only
existing political leadership on class struggle principles,
and that the supporters of the YS have come into basic-
polticial solidarity with the SWP on the principles of
revolutionary socialism.
On March 10, 1967, a source advised that the YSA
was formed during 1957, by youth of various left socialist
tendencies, particularly members and followers of the SWP.
The source further advised that the YSA has recently become
more open about admitting that it is the youth group of the
SWP and that an SWP representative has publicily stated that
the YSA is the SWP's youth group.
The headquarters of the YSA are located in Rooms
532-536, 41 Union Square West, New York City.
The SWP has been designated pursuant to Executive
Order 10450.

As the cost of the war in lives
and money mounts daily, the
women of this country call upon
congress to take action against
it. To support the senators and
Congressmen who oppose the war,
to encourage those who are troubled
but silent, to speak out, and to
make our position known to those
who still support this immoral
war, we, as women of Hawaii, are
gathered here. Our message to
Reps. Mink and Matsunaga, to
Sens. Fong and Inouye, is that
women will no longer give their sons and loved ones to a government
waging a genocidal war..
women will no longer accept a government which represents a military
and industrial machine rather than its people...
women will no longer consent to raise their children in the blight
and neglect of a society geared to profit and war...
women grieve for suffering people all over the world and will no longer
remain silent while the gap widens between the rich and the poor...
We ask our government to design and carry out a domestic program
commensurate with the needs of the American people; to follow a
policy of non-intervention in the affairs of other countries; to
pursue our official committment to disarmament, and to respect
international law.
American women who, as women everywhere, are the bearers and conservers
of life, will not stand idly by as life is destroyed in our name.
About two hundred Oahu women have signed the following petition to
Congress:
As Congress reconvenes, we urge that its first order of business
be to put an end to the war in Vietnam and arrange for the withdrawal
of American troops; and that the Congress turn its attention to
ameliorating the crisis in America.
We urge the Congress to heal a sick society at home, to make reparations
for the ravaged land we leave behind in Vietnam and to refuse to
listen to the insatiable demands of the military-industrial complex.
I want to be kept informed about women's peace activities.

STION
It was previously reported that the Jeannette
Rankin Brigade, a nationwide group of women who are opposed
to the war in Vietnam, would sponsor a demonstration in
Washington, D. C., on January 15, 1968, to petition Congress
to end the war in Vietnam.
At 11:40 a.m., January 15, 1963, a group,
predominantly women numbering approximately 2,600, assembled
at Union Station, Washington, D. C., and marched six abreast
on the west sidewalk of Louisiana Avenue to Union Square at
the foot of Capitol Hill.
**
The marchers were preceded by several individuals
carrying a large banner which read, "End the War in Vietnam
and Social Crisis at Hope." Several wonen followed the
marchers carrying another banner which read, "United States
Women Unite, End the War in Vietnam, Prior to leaving
Union Station, participants carried several other small
placards some of which read, "End the War" and "LBJ Eats
Imperial Margarine." At the request of authorities, the
demonstrators discarded these placards.
Before the demonstrators left Union Station, a
delegation of 15 women, including Jeannette Rankin, drove
to the Capitol where they presented a petition to Represen-
tative John W. McCormack, Speaker of the House of Represen-
tatives, and to Senator Michael J. Mansfield. This petition
was entitled "A Petition to the 90th Congress" and stated
the following:
"We Women of the United States, who are outraged
by the ruthless slaughter in Vietnam and the
persistent neglect of human needs at home, have
come to Washington to petition the Congress of
the United States for the redress of intolerable
grievance and demand that:

During the time that the main group of demon-
strators was meeting in the Ambassador Room of the Hotel,
a small group, who called themselves the Radical Women's
Group and composed mainly of younger women, met in the
adjoining Regency Room of the Hotel. This meeting was
highly disorganized, without apparent purpose or objective
and developed no conclusions.
Although workshops were announced to be held
following the assembly, the vast majority of those present
at the meeting left the Hotel following the 5:40 p.m.
conclusion of the meeting and returned to Union Station
for the trip home.
tif
In addition to the demonstration in Washington, D.C.,
sympathy demonstrations were held by contingents of the
Brigade in various cities throughout the country.
In Miami, Florida, 70 women assembled at the
Torch of Friendship, Bay Front Park, and participated in
a silent vigil.
:
Approximately 150 to 200 demonstrators gathered
on the front steps of the San Francisco City Hall in support
of the demonstration in Washington, D. C. At this demon-
stration, Nikki Bridges, San Francisco Chairman of the
Brigade, announced that since it was not possible for the
demonstrators to personally contact their Congressmen who
were out of town, that following the presentation of a
petition to Mayor Joseph Alioto, they would proceed to a
near-by Western Union office in order that wires could be
sent to their Congressmen protesting United States policy
in Vietnam. Mayor Alioto appeared on the steps of City Hall,
received the petition, and announced that he would transmit
it to Congress. Nikki Bridges is the wife of Harry Bridges
who was indicted for perjury and conspiracy committed to
conceal Communist Party membership in obtaining United States
citizenship in 1949.

Information has previously been disseminated
to the White House and other interested agencies concerning
the plans of captioned organization, a nationwide group of
women who are opposed to the war in Vietnam, to stage a
demonstration in Washington, D.C. on 1/15/68 and present a
petition to Congress demanding an end to the Vietnam war.
This demonstration was held as scheduled on 1/15/68.
The demonstrators marched from Union Station to
Union Square at the foot of Capitol Hill by way of Louisiana
Avenue. The group was preceded by several individuals
carrying a banner which read "End the War in Vietnam and Social
Crisis at Home." Several women followed the marchers
carrying another banner which read "United States Women
Unite, End the War in Vietnam." Initially, the group carried
other placards which read "End the War" and "LBJ Eats
Imperial Margarine." However, at the request of authorities,
these placards were discarded.
Before the demonstrators left Union Station, a
delegation of 15 women, including Jeannette Rankin, drove
to the Capitol where they presented a petition to
Representative John W. McCormack, Speaker of the House of
Representatives, and to Senator Michael J. Mansfield. The
petition entitled "A Petition to the 90th Congress" pointed
out the opposition of women of the United States to the
ruthless slaughter in Vietnam and the persistant neglect to
human needs at home and demanded Congress as the first order
of business resolve to end the war in Vietnam and immediately
withdraw all American troops. It called for Congress to use its
power to help a sick society at home, to make reparations for
destruction in Vietnam and to listen to what the American people
are saying and refuse the insatiable demands of the military
industrial complex.

at a National Women's Conference called three years previously
by the JPFO.
"The Morning Freiheit" (MF) on January 25, 1951,
contained a report of the National Convention of the ELD of
the JPFO which took place in New York City on January 20
and 21, 1951. At this convention, it was noted that the ELD
changed its name to Emma Lazarus Federation of Jewish
Women's Clubs (ELF) and adopted a new constitution.
On May 4, 1966, a source advised that the ELF was
recognized by the Communist Party (CP) United States of America
(USA) as an important national organization of women whose
leadership was primarily made up of Communists. The source.
stated the ELF was dedicated to peace, in protecting the rights
of foreign born, and against bomb testing, Negro discrimination
and the rearmament of West Germany.
The source also stated the ELF renders support to and
receives support from the MF and other Jewish progressive
organizations.
The ELF National Office was moved and is now located
at 150 Fifth Avenue, Room 632, New York, New York.
The IWO and JPFO have been designated
pursuant to Executive Order 10450.

DEMONSTRATION PROTESTING
UNITED STATES POLICY IN VIETNAM,
WASHINGTON, D. C.,
JANUARY 8, 1968
INFORMATION CONCERNING
The "Kansas City Star" newspaper, Kansas City,
Missouri, edition of January 14, 1968, contained an article
stating that Kansas City women were responding to a "woman
power" appeal issued by Miss Jeanette Rankin, former member
of Congress, to end the war in Vietnam. According to the
article, a small delegation of Kansas City women plan to go
to Washington, D. C., on January 15, 1968, to participate in
the march by the "Jeanette Rankin Brigade" to petition Congress
for a United States withdrawal from Vietnam. The others in
the group would remain in Kansas City and present copies of
the petition to the offices of U. S. Representatives Richard
Bolling, Kansas City, Missouri, and Larry Winn, Kansas City,
Kansas, at 1:00 p.m., on January 15, 1968.
The "Kansas City Star" evening edition of January
15, 1968, carried an article stating that on the afternoon
of January 15, 1968, 20 women appeared at the offices of
Representatives Bolling and Winn. They carried no signs
and the demonstration was orderly. The women, all from the
greater Kansas City area, merely presented a petition asking
Congress to end the war in Vietnam and withdraw American
troops, to make reparations for the "ravaged land we leave
behind in Vietnam", and to listen to the American people
and refuse "the insatiable demands of the military-industrial
complex". The article stated that the Kansas City branch of
the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom
had been planning to send representatives to the Washington
march, but it was not until Wednesday that they decided to
present the petitions to Congressmen Winn and Bolling.
According to the article, Mrs. John M. Swomley, Jr.,
Program Chairman of the organization, stated the Kansas City
group hoped to identify with the women in Washington and their
objective to bring and end to the war in Vietnam.

DEMONSTRATION PROTESTING U.S.

SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA
JANUARY 15, 1968
Chairman of the Brigade, announced to the demonstrators that this
local demonstration was principally gathered to support women
from around the United States who were gathered in Washington,
D.C. today, as part of a nation-wide demonstration sponsored by
the Jeannette Rankin Brigade, to petition Congress to resolve
the conflict in Vietnam. Bridges stated that inasmuch as it
was not possible for the demonstrators to personally contact
their congressmen, most of whom were out of town%3B that following
the presentation of a petition to Mayor Joseph Alioto, the
demonstrators would then proceed to the Western Union Office on
10th and Market Streets in San Francisco, so that the women
protestors could send wires to their congressmen, protesting
United States policies in Vietnam. Bridges indicated that the
petitioners would request Mayor Alioto to convey to Congress
their petition, which among other things urged Congress, as its
first order of business, to resolve to end the War in Vietnam and
immediately arrange for withdrawal of all American troops from
Vietnam; for Congress to use its power to heal the sick society
at home and to make reparations for the ravaged lands left
behind in Vietnam.
A source advised March 2, 1967, that Mrs. H.
Bridges, also known as
Nikki Bridges, 35
Kronquest Court, San Francisco, California, was
listed as a recipient of a new yearly subscription
to the "People's World" (PW), expiration date
March 4, 1968.
The PW is a west coast communist newspaper,
published weekly in San Francisco.
The next speaker was identified as Aileen Hernandez.
She spoke for approximately five minutes and briefly explained
to the demonstrators who Jeannette Rankin is and what the purposes
of the Jeannette Rankin Brigade are. She stated that the group
has no principal spokesman and it is principally a group of
women who are involved and committed in a fight for peace.
Several of the demonstrators, led by Nikki Bridges,
then proceeded to the Office of Mayor Joseph Alioto to present
their petition.

DEMONSTRATION PROTESTING U. S.
POLICY IN VIETNAM
SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA
JANUARY 15, 1968
Approximately ten minutes later the Mayor of
San Francisco appeared on the steps of the City Hall and announced
to the demonstrators that he would gladly transmit their
petition to Congress. Mayor Alioto stated that he fully
believed in the constitutional right of peaceful assembly.
He indicated, however, that because he had consented to
transmit the demonstrators' petition to Washington, he did not
necessarily agree with it. The Mayor then stated that it
was his personal opinion that the United States Government and
the Johnson Administration had done all in its power, to attempt
to come to a peaceful and honorable solution in the Vietnamese
War. He related that he felt that it was now up to the other
side to make the same attempts to arrive at a peaceful solution
in the Vietnamese conflict.
At approximately 12:45 p.m., the demonstrators proceeded'
to the Western Union Office located at 10th and Market Streets
in San Francisco, so that wires could be sent to their congressmen
in Washington.
A Special Agent of the FBI observed one Elaine
Yoneda participating in the above demonstration and following
the demonstration Yoneda was observed to return to her employment
at the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union
(ILWU) - Pacific Maritime Association, Pension Fund, at 150
Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco.
A second source advised on December 4, 1967, that
Elaine Yoneda is a current and active member of the Communist
Party (CP).
On January 15, 1968, a Special Agent of the FBI
observed a silent protest by a group of women on the lawn
of Colton Hall, Monterey, California, between 3:00 and 5:00 p.m.
These women were ostensibly gathered to support the demonstration
being held in Washington, D.C., sponsored by the Jeannette Rankin
Brigade. There were no speeches given; the demonstrators merely
conducted a silent vigil.
A one page leaflet captioned "Women To Take First
Step to End The War" printed by the Jeannette Rankin Brigade,
at 150 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, California, was handed
out at the above demonstration. A Xeroxed duplication of this
leaflet is appended to this memorandum.

"Peace Throughout the Earth"
"We Demand An End To The War In Viet Nam Immediately"
"Peace On Earth. Good Will To All Men"
"Join Our Silent Vigil For Peace In Viet Nam"
"Vietnamese Are Our Brothers Whom We Kill"
"For A World Without War"
"We Pause To Remember Our Brothers Who Gave Their
Lives In Viet Nam”
Literature distributed identified the sponsor of
the demonstration as the "Women's International League for
Peace and Freedom" (see attached xerox copy).
The participants, following the vigil, continued
their demonstration by walking in single file with the
anti-war signs through the downtown city streets to the
Federal Building where they dispersed at 3:15 p.m.
No incidents were observed to occur.
Source also advised that at least six people from
greater Miami had considered traveling to Washington, D. C.
to participate in the demonstration in that city being
sponsored by the Jeannette Rankin Brigade although no firm
plans had been made. Among these individuals was Greta
Lynch.
A second source in April, 1951, advised
that Greta Lynch that year stated she
had been expelled from the Communist Party
in 1944.

I am proud of the fact that my Sturt vote cast in Congress
was a vote against war. I was the first opportunity for a
woman to vote because I was the first woman to be elected
to Congress.
I believed then as I do today that women are the ones who
must be concerned with the needs and development of the

JANUARY 15, 1968
INFORMATION CONCERNING
Reference is made to a memorandum,
captioned as above, dated December 28,
1967, at Miami, Florida. The memorandum
concerned a call issued by the Jeannette
Rankin Brigade for American Women to travel
to Washington, D. C. on January 15, 1968,
to petition the United States Congress to
end the war in Viet Nam.
A source, on January 15, 1968, advised that the Miami
Chapter of the Women's International League for Peace and
Freedom (WILPF) had scheduled a demonstration to take place
January 15, 1968, at Miami, Florida. The demonstration
would be a support activity for the Jeannette Rankin Brigade
that would be in Washington, D. C. on that date to petition
Congress to end the war in Viet Nam.
The January 16, 1968, issue of
the "Miami Herald," a local Miami, Florida
newspaper, contained an article entitled
"Five Thousand Women Join Viet War Protest."
The article identified Jeannette Rankin
as an 87 year old woman pacifist and
former member of Congress who voted in
Congress against the American entry into
both world wars.
•
A Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of Investi-
gation (FBI) on January 15, 1968, observed an anti-war
demonstration take place in Miami, Florida. Approximately
70 participants, mostly elderly women, assembled at the
Torch of Friendship, Bayfront Park, downtown Miami, at
2:00 p.m.
They stood in silent vigil, some wearing black

The following information was obtained from a

Jeannette Rankin Brigade (JRB) on their demonstration in
Washington, D.C., on January 15, 1968:
The special JRB train departed Pennsylvania
Station, New York City, at approximately 7:30 AM. The
train appeared to be nearly full. It arrived at Union
Station, Washington, D.C., shortly after twelve noon.
The large group of women proceeded to Grant Park which is
in the vicinity of the United States Capitol. At Grant
Park there was a total of approximately 4,000 women and
they remained at the park from 12:45 PM to 1:30 PM. They
were instructed by those in charge that they should carry
no signs, engage in any group singing or be disorderly in
any manner. A folk singer by the name of Judy Collins D
entertained, the group at the park. A sound truck arrived
and Vivica Lindfors, the actress, read an anti-Vietnam
war petition which Jeannette Rankin was to present to the
leaders of Congress. Jeannette Rankin then took this
petition and with a small group of women, went into the
United States Capitol.
After she returned at approximately 1:30 PM,
most of the demonstrators went by bus to the Shoreham
Hotel, arriving at approximately 2:00 PM. They held a

A source advised on May 9, 1967, that it was his
understanding that the National Lawyers Guild (NLG) was
formed around 1936 in New York City, and that the Chicago
Chapter of the NLG (CCNLG), which is affiliated with the
national group in New York, was formed shortly thereafter,
possibly in 1937 by a group of liberal progressive lawyers
in protest against activities of the American Bar Association
which they claimed was a non-liberal, non-progressive
organization. The CCNLG has no established headquarters but
occasionally uses the return address of its officials in
literature.

Alexander, and Glory Roberts. Two women affiliated with
\the peace-oriented Pasadena Chapter of the Women's International
League for Peace and Freedom; Cathy Hofer and Marian Beardsley,
were also to join the above women for the flight to Washington,
according to Source One.
On January 15, 1968, Special Agents of the Los Angeles
Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation observed a
group of women assemble in front of the Old State Building, 217
West First Street (First and Broadway, in the downtown Civic
Center), Los Angeles, California, at approximately 9:30 AM.
The women were carrying placards indicating they were the
local representation of the JRB. They also had two leaflets
for distribution (Xerox copies of which are appended to this
memorandum) which called for women to participate and which
indicated that a voting block of American women had the power
to put an end to the war in Vietnam. These leaflets bore the
address of the JRB as 5899 West Pico Boulevard, Los Angeles,
California (90019), which is the address of the headquarters of
the WSP in Southern California.
Starting shortly after 10:00 AM, the women proceeded
to hold a rally on the south steps of the Old State Building,
with the speakers utilizing an electronic amplification system,
which was held by actress Leslie Parrish.
Source One indicated that Parrish had originally been¨
scheduled to fly to Washington, D. C., to participate in the
JRB action at the Capitol, but changed her plans at the last
minute in order to remain in Los Angeles.
The rally was headed by Tima Tomash, who acted as
the local JRB organizer and answered some of the questions
regarding the JRB from members of the news media on the scene.
Veronica Sissons acted as mistress of ceremonies. Speakers
included Mary Henry, Negro civil rights and poverty worker%3
Margaret Wright (who has been identified by Sources One and
Two as a militant black nationalist, who has been extremely
active in recent months in disturbances at Manual Arts High
School, Los Angeles, which resulted in a court injunction to
prohibit her entering those school grounds)%;B and television
actress Ellen McRae. The speakers all called for a coalition
of women to form a strong voting block which could produce
legislation to end the war in Vietnam, end poverty and "legislated
injustice".

Source One reported that the final local planning
meeting of the Jeannette Rankin Brigade (JRB) Committee in
Southern California, was held on January 11, 1968, in the
offices of the Women Strike for Peace (WSP) (see appendix),
5899 West Pico Boulevard, Los Angeles. A communication was
received from Mary erarke (see characterization in appendix
page on WSP) indicating that she and Vivian Hallinan of San
Francisco, Califomia, were already in Washington, D. C.,
making final arrangements for the JRB action to be held in
that city on January 15, 1968. Clarke indicated that she and
Mrs. Hallinan had already received numerous queries from
representatives of the Washington news media regarding proposed
action to be taken by the JRB. She also noted that it might
be necessary to re-route the proposed JRB march on the Capitol,
in view of some "1882 Law" relating to demonstrations in the
vicinity of the Capitol building.
According to Source One the women from Southern
California, travelling to participate in the Washington JRB
action, were to leave Los Angeles Saturday night, January 13,
1968, via American Airlines Flight 78. Most of them were to
return to Los Angeles, from Dulles International Airport, on
Tuesday, January 16, 1968, via American Airlines Flight 75.

As of January 12, 1968, the following women affiliated
with WSP were scheduled to travel from Southern California to
Washington for the JRB-demonstration: Eva Kom, Mary Lewis,
Bea Glass, Florence Temkin, Mildred Holland, Ada Wasserman,

Dear Friend:
1
We are sending this letter to you and others from whom we have not heard much
recently, in the hope of re-enlisting your efforts in the Women for Peace
movement. It has been too long since we last heard directly from many of you,
and our meetings with those of you whom we have seen recently have been brief.
Of course, we know the paralyzing sense of frustration we all feel occasionally,
as we learn of the mounting horrors in Vietnam. But this feeling is only
temporary, and quickly gives way to activity. As women, we bear the major
responsibility for the preservation of life, and thus a major responsibility
in the peace movement,
Enclosed you will find an announcement of the latest national women's effort
for peace.
Several peace groups in Portland are cooperating in raising funds
to send representatives to Washington. We hope that you will also support this
effort, to insure representation from Portland Women for Peace.
The coupon
on the enclosed notice is for your use in this effort.

In addition, we will have a supportive peaceful demonstration

We are asking participants to wear black, and to bring a black

expressing support for the Jeannette Rankin Brigade, will be
available. We shall march around the Post Office block for one hour,
from noon to 1 p.m., leafleting as we walk.
We hope, if you cannot go to Washington, yourself, that you will contribute to
help someone else to go, and that you will also join with us at the Pioneer
Post Office at noon Monday, January 15th,
In addition, please let us hear from you on your ideas of what more we might
do locally. We have some ideas too, which we hope to share with you, and on
which we shall need much help.
Please get in touch with one of us soon.

At 10:50 AM, the women marched to the steps on the
First Street side of the Los Angeles City Hall for a second
rally. A count made as the demonstrators marched between the
Old State Building and the City Hall revealed that 250
adult Caucasians (majority of whom were women dressed in
black), and eight non-Caucasian adults were involved, plus
some youngsters and infants. The mother of one of the children
had a cardboard sign, depicting a bomb and the caption, "I'm
Glad I'm Not Vietnamese", strapped to the back of her son who
appeared to be less than four years of age.
The latter/

was introduced as a radio commentator employed by Los Angeles
Radio Station KLAC. She joined the others in calling for a
coalition of women to influence legislation and bring an end to
the war in Vietnam. She also called for support of other "liberal
radio broadcasters on our side", one of whom she named as
William Winter. (The "Daily People's World", west coast
communist newspaper, in its edition of June 11, 1946, described
William Winter as chairman of a local citizens' committee to
safeguard the Joint Anti-Fascist Refuge Committee, which
organization has been cited pursuant to Executive Order 10450).
Charlotte Sherman was introduced as the wife of
Laurence Sherman, it being pointed out that he was an
unsuccessful candidate for public office, on a peace slate,
during 1967, but that both he and his wife were continuing the
fight for an end to the war in Vietnam. She said, "It is time.
for us to re-examine our role as women. Women are a vehicle
for giving life. We will not be a vehicle for perpetuation
of wars She then read some anti-war quotes from Henry David
Thoreau, indicating they were as timely today, as when he wrote
them.
Margaret Wright stated that where's the majority of
women in the demonstration were wearing black to denote mourning,
that she and her non-Caucasian associates who feel, "Black is
beautiful" were dressed in white to indicate their attitude of
mourning. She called for the elimination of ROTC (Reserve
Officers Training Corps) from local high schools and junior
colleges, adding, "They have got to get live bullets out of the
schools, and get some live teachers in." She repeated these
same statements during the afternoon when the JRB moved to
the Los Angeles City Board of Education.
As the rally was breaking up, Wright grabbed the
public address system and said that it had been learned that
the City Council was in session inside the City Hall Building.
NW 88321 Docld:32989545 Page 694

--- Image 124-10274-10125_page_1292.jpeg ---
She urged the women not to disperse, but to join her and ...
others in invading the City Council Chambers with a demand
that the JRB be allowed to speak to the Council even though
they had not made previous arrangements for a place on the
agenda that day. Some of the women were already out of range
of the public address system and did not hear this announcement
by Wright, having already been dismissed by. Sissons and told to
reconvene at the Board of Education following luncheon.
Approximately 200 of the demonstrators did enter
the Council Chambers. They got word to the councilmen, through
one of the staff members, that they wished to be heard.
A motion to allow a JRB representative to address them was
put before the Council, and defeated by a vote of six to five.
Immediately following this vote, there was a unanimous vote
that the Council adjourn. As the councilmen filed out of the
room, Tima Tomash rushed to the front shouting demands that
they return, while other of the women hissed and booed the
city legislators.
k
During the noon hour some of the women distributed-
leaflets in the City Hall and on the surrounding streets in
the downtown Civic Center.
At 1:00 PM, the women, whose numbers had by that
time been reduced to 125, massed in the patio of the Los
Angeles City Board of Education, 450 North Grand Avenue,
Los Angeles. Sissons, Wright and Tomash addressed-the
assembled demonstrators, pointing out that money spent in
Vietnam could be better spent in education. Wright claimed
that many of the so-called student "drop-outs" are in reality
"push-outs", claiming that she herself was one of the latter.
She said, "We need books, not bombs. We know this is a racist
war and we blacks are not going to fight a racist war" She
indicated that rather than fight overseas, the black people
would remain at home and fight the racists. She also said,
"Just because I'm pro-black doesn't necessarily mean I'm anti-.
white."
+
Wright said, "I'm not political, but I am honest. I
can't honestly get up and say the pledge of allegiance to the
American flag, because I really don't have liberty and justice%3B
so I just get up and stand and won't repeat the pledge. Stice;
Later, when she observed a photograph of President Johnson
hanging from a wall in the Administration Building at the
Los Angeles City Board of Education, she told the JRB women
with her, "We shouldn't have to look at such pornographic
pictures.

Wright said that her arrest at the hands of Los
Angeles City School Security Officers, during the recent..
Manual Arts High School disturbance, had at least one bright
·result.
She said that at the time of her arrest it had been
necessary for the arresting officers to drag her down the
hall as she was too heavy for them to carry. Then she added
that the next time she is arrested the officers will not have
that excuse as she has lost thirty pounds in the meantime.
->
The speeches in the patio ended at 1:30 PM and many
of the women left immediately. Seventy-eight women remained
and attempted to enter a special committee meeting being attended
by some of the School Board members. They were informed by a
member of the administrative staff that the public meeting of the
School Board would not be held until 4:00 PM, the regularly
scheduled meeting time. The women milled around in the hallway
outside the meeting room, until finally a staff member came out
and told them that two members of the School Board, Reverend
James E. Jones and Dr. Julian Nava, had agreed to grant them an
audience. The women were then ushered into the public board
room of the School Board where they waited until 2:00 PM at
which time the above-named Board members granted the demonstrators
a short audience and answered some questions put to them by the
women. One question, as to how much longer the members of the
School Board were going to permit recruiters from the armed
forces to interview students at local high schools and junior
colleges remained unanswered, but Dr. Nava pointed out to the
women that he had seen nothing wrong in entering the armed-
forces to fight for this country himself when he was 17 years
of age, and he could see nothing wrong in other young men who
wanted to do the same today. The demonstration was concluded
by 3:00 PM. There were no incidents and no arrests.¨¨

Placards carried during this demonstration in Los
Angeles bore the following captions:
"Eat Texas Beef, Not L.B.J. Baloney"
"Woman Power is Vote Power is Peace Power"
"Draft Beer Not Students"

WOMEN FOR LEGISLATIVE ACTION
à source advised on May 1, 1963, that the Women
for Legislative Action was formed in 1952, claiming to be
an iniind organization dedicated to non-partisan parti-
cication in legislative and civic activities. Its position
in favoring or opposing legislation usually parallels the
position of the Communist Farty and related groups. It also
sumports legislation to abolish the House Committee on Un-
American Activities. Membership in the Women for Legislative
Action does not, of itself, connote membership in or sympathy
with the Communist Party.
Another source advised on May 11, 1967, that the
Women for Legislative Action continues to be active in the

demonstration read, "Support Dr. Spock. They marched around
the courthouse until 11:00 AM, when the demonstration was con-

to 1950, and as a member of the New York State
CP School Commission during a portion of that
period.
Source Four identified Else Sturm as a member of

COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF THE
WOMEN STRIKE FOR PEACE,
Also Known As
Women's International Strike for Peace
It
A source advised on May 14, 1967, that the Women
Strike for Peace (WSP) in the Southern California area began
its operations in the late fall of 1961, as an affiliate
of the national organization formed in Washington, D.C.
is a peace oriented women's organization which is opposed
to the present American foreign policy in Vietnam. It has
also sought legislation which would bring about the abolition
of the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HCUA). In
recent months the organization has sponsored demonstrations
protesting the United States involvement in Vietnam and
calling for the complete withdrawal of all United States
troops from Vietnam. In the spring of 1966, it was instrumental
in originating and putting into effect a campaign advocating
support for "peace candidates" in the upcoming 1966 Congressional
elections.
The same source stated that WSP is a non-membership
organization and has no officers. The organization is open
to women of all political opinions who are interested in world.
peace. It makes no effort to exclude from its activities
members of, or persons sympathetic to, the Communist Party
· and related groups.
The guiding force behind the Southern California
WSP groups is MARY CLARKE. A second source advised in July,
1955, that CLARKE was dropped from the Western Division, Los
Angeles County Communist Party (LACCP) in the Spring of 1955,
for personal reasons and not because of any political differences
with the LACCP.
•
The first source advised that Southern California
WSP maintains its office at 5899 West Pico Boulevard, Los
Angeles. It receives mail through Post Office Box 19739,

Women's Bail Fund
YAWF
YAWF is the youth group of the Workers World
Party (WWP).
WWP
V
The WWP was founded in 1959 by individuals who
disagreed with policies of the Socialist Workers
Party (SWP). The WWP dissidents advocated
unconditional support of the Soviet Union and the
building of a revolutionary party geared to the
overthrow of capitalism. More recently the WWP
has called for peaceful solutions to Sino-Soviet
disputes, however, the WWP generally supports the
People's Republic of China in its ideological
differences with the Soviet Union.
The SWP has been designated pursuant to
Executive Order 10450.
A third confidential source advised on May 18,
1971, the Women's Bail Fund has called for victory for the
Vietcong and is setting up a "phone chain" to be able to call
for "action against the transfer of women from the House of
Detention to Rikers Island.
ft
On June 6, 1971, the third source advised the Women's
Bail Fund will have a "major bail out of women" from the Women's
House of Detention from June 10 to June 13, 1971 at the Washington
Square Methodist Church.
It will include four
days of "discussions, films, counseling and information services"
for inmates and their families. The coordinator for the Bail
Fund was identified as Pam Engle, telephone number 989-6717.
On July 26, 1971, SAS of the FBI observed a picket-
type demonstration at 51st Street and Avenue of the Americas
protesting the existence of all jails. Among the groups
represented was the Women's Bail Fund.
On August 4, 1971, a fourth confidential source
advised the following checks were among those drawn from the
bank account of Lubell, Lubell, Fine and Schaap, Attorneys-at-
Law, 103 Park Avenue, NY, NY.

SCEF (Continued)
continued as an independent organization, rallying support
for integration and democracy and helping to stimulate
and nurture new movements of the early 1960's. The SCEF
maintained headquarters in Louisiana for twenty years, but
in 1966 moved its headquarters to Louisville, Kentucky.
A source advised on March 2, 1961, that Claude
Lightfoot, a Communist Party functionary, stated at a meeting
of the Communist Party in Baltimore, Maryland, on February 25,
1961, that the Communist Party is not connected with any
progressive movement but indirectly they do have some influence
in the SCEF.
A second source, who is familiar with some phases
of Communist Party activity in the New Orleans area, advised
on June 3, 1966, that during the time that the SCHW was in
existence, members of the Communist Party were members of
and worked actively in the SCHW; however, since the formation
of the SCEF, Communist Party members have not been encouraged
to work in the SCEF. The source stated that the SCEF is
a progressive, liberal organization, which he considers a
Communist Party front organization because it has gone along
with the Communist Party on certain issues, particularly
on the racial issue.
A third source advised on May 25, 1965, that
George Meyers, a Communist Party functionary, expressed
great admiration for Carl and Anne Braden and the SCEF,
with which they are affiliated, and expressed the view
that the SCEF is the best organization in the South
as doing effective work is concerned and that they have a
better idea of what they are doing, where they are heading,
and influence other organizations for the better.
as far
The second source also advised on June 3, 1966,
that many people who are officials and supporters of the
SCEF, while liberal in their views, are by no means Communists.

I am proud of the fact that my first vote cast in Congress was a vote against war.
It was the first opportunity for a woman to vote, because I was the first woman
to be elected to Congress.
R
I believed then, as I do today, that women are the ones that must be concerned
with the needs, and. development of the human race. I have always fought for the
dignity of all human beings for those of the present as well as those of future
generations.
I will continue to struggle as long as I live. I hope all women will respond to
the following call and join me in Washington on January 3, 1968, the opening day
of Congress.

effective on a local level, sometimes a mass outpouring of
feeling like this is helpful,

The December 27, 1963, edition of "The New York World
legram and Sun" newspaper stated that the pro-Castro FPCC
seeking to go out of business and that its prime activity
during its lifetime had been sponsorship of pro-Castro street
rallies and mass picket lines, and the direction of an active
propaganda mill highlighting illegal travel-to-Cuba campaigns.
Its comparatively brief span of life was attributed to mounting
anti-Castro American public opinion, the 1962 Congressional
hearings which disclosed FPCC financing by Castro's United
Nations Delegation, and ultimately, the bad publicity which
the FPCC received from disclosure of activities on its behalf
by suspected presidential assassin Lee H. Oswald.
On February 6, 1964, the previously mentioned second
source advised that V. T. Lee had recently remarked that the
FPCC was dead and that there were no plans to organize another
similar organization.
On April 13, 1964, a third source advised that there
had not been any FPCC activity in many months and that the
FPCC had been dissolved.

APPENDIX
FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE
IF
The April 6, 1960, edition of "The New York Times"
newspaper contained a full-page advertisement captioned
"What Is Really Happening In Cuba," placed by the Fair Play
for Cuba Committee (FPCC). This advertisement announced the
formation of the FPCC in New York City and declared the FPCC
intended to promulgate "the truth about revolutionary Cuba" to
neutralize the distorted American press.
"The New York Times" edition of January 11, 1961,
reported that at a hearing conducted before the United States
Senate Internal Security Subcommittee on January 10, 1961,
Dr. Charles A. Santos-Buch identified himself and Robert Taber
as organizers of the FPCC. He also testified he and Taber
obtained funds from the Cuban Government which were applied
toward the cost of the aforementioned advertisement.
On May 16, 1963, a source advised that during the
first two years of the FPCC's existence there was a struggle
between Communist Party (CP) and Socialist Workers Party(SWP)
elements to exert their power within the FPCC and thereby
influence FPCC policy. This source added that during the past
year there had been a successful effort by FPCC leadership to
minimize the role of these and other organizations in the FPCC
so that their influence as of May, 1963, was negligible.
The SWP has been designated pursuant to Executive
Order 10450.
On May 20, 1963, a second source advised that Vincent
"Ted" Lee, FPCC National Office Director, was then formulating
FPCC policy and had indicated that he had no intention of
permitting FPCC policy to be determined by any other organization.
This source stated that Lee believed that the FPCC should.
advocate resumption of diplomatic relations between Cuba and
the United States and should support the right of
the Cuban
Cubans to manage their revolution without interference from
other nations. Les did not advocate supportin
revolution per se.
The November 23, 1963, edition of "The New York Times"
reported that Senator Thomas J. Dodd of Connecticut had called
FPCC "the chief public relations instrument of the Castro network
in the United States." It is to be noted that Senator Dodd was
a member of the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee which
twice conducted hearings on the FPCC.

Mass women's

SAN FRANCISCO
--
When
Congress reconvenes in Jan-
uary, the opening session will
be met with the demand that
its first order of business must
be ending the Vietnam war
and the withdrawal of Ameri
can troops from Southeast Asia.
'This demand will be pres-
ented by woman power, organ-
ized into the Jeanette Rankin
Brigade.
The women plan to convene
a Congress of American Women
to develop programs "dedicated
to reshaping American society
and restoring our country to
the community of nations.”
Besides demanding that the
legislators act to end the war,
the women will demand that
Congress:
Use its power to heal a sick
society at home;
Use its power to make re-
|parations for the ravaged land
we leave behind in Vietnam;
• Listen to what the Ameri-
can people are saying and re-
fuse the insatiable demands of
the military-industrial complex.
This movement was inspired
by an appeal by Jeanetto Ran-
Jan, 86, the nation's first woman
in Congress, elected in 1917.
"If we had 10,000 women will-
ing to go to prizon if necessary,'
she said in May, "that would
on it. You cannot have wars
without the women."
Miss Rankin, a militant lead-
er of the suffragette movement
that eventually gained women
the right to vote under the
19th Amen Im..., voted in 1917
against U.S involvement in
World War I and also oppose
American military commitment
in World War II.
"This is no time to be po-
bte," Miss Rankin said. "The
army isn't polite when it se-
lects a young man and says
'come and fight'. But they don't
take the politicians and deci-
vion makers to fight."
"

Jeanette Rankin
Rankin Brigade in
Washington.
Women for Peace and the
Women's Intl. League for Peace
and Freedom have rallio? to
support of the action and a
drive is now underway to get
the largest possible number of
women to Washington for the
joint opening session of Con-
gress.
-
Supportive action by women
who cannot go to Washington
will be planned in various loca-
lities.
One facet of the Congress of
American Women will be dis-
cussion of electoral action, says
Nikki Bridges, San Francisco
chairman of the brigade.
"Many of us feel we should
support peace candidates where
they exist and go into politics
ourselves in other places, be-
cause that way you get a forum
you don't otherwise have," she
says.
At present efforts are being
made to get support from as

With regard to Women Strike for Peace
(WSP), the "People's World", west coast
communist newspaper, in its issue of
October 20, 1962, quoted Dr. FRANCES
✓ HERRING, national leader of WSP, "as"
stating the organization "was composed
of autonomous local groups 'open to
women of any race, religious creed or
political ideology: "
"
"
On May 3, 1965, a third source made available
a leaflet distributed by Seattle Women Act
for Peace (SWAP) (see appendix), local
affiliate of WSP which stated in part,
that Mrs. DONNA ALLEN,
!, a national leader
of WSP%3B Mrs. DAGMAR WILSON, founder and
leader of WSF; and RUSS NIXON, General Manager
of the "National Guardian" (see appendix) were
"found guilty of contempt in the U.S. District.
Court of the District of Columbia for refusing
to testify at a closed meeting of HUAC (they
had expressed a willingness to testify at an
open hearing where their views would not be
subject to possible distortion by HUAC, as
has happened at other closedHUAC hearings).
The American Friends Service Committee (AFSC)
is the social outreach arm of the religious
group known as the Society of Friends (Quakers).

:
The Women's International League for Peace
and Freedom, according to a fourth source
in July 1961, held'its annual meeting at
St. Paul, Minnesota, from June 26 - 30, 1961.

TAIMI HALONEN and THORUN ROBEL were mildly self-
critical about not working for the programs the younger women
were promoting. TAIMI said she was tired after working long
hours on the Seattle conference to be held Saturday, January
20th at Mt. Zion Baptist Church in Seattle at which the
Seattle delegation would report. HALONEN made the observation,
however, that the women working on the program were all very
experienced leaders and she trusted they would formulate a
satisfactory program.
On Monday, January 15, 1968, the delegates including
the group from Washington State, met at the Union Station in
Washington, D.C. It was learned here that the instructions
which had been given the day before at the Shoreham Hotel were
evidently for the California group only, because many California
people had been badly beaten in previous demonstrations and
they were very cautious and somewhat apprehensive. The
official pattern was different. Mimeographed sheets headed
"Jearrette Rankin Brigade - Information and Instructions" were
passed out and these appeared to be the official instructions.
A reproduction is attached.
"
The Washington State delegation was enlarged when a
Mrs BACKUP from Tacoma arrived. RADER said some of the money
usually received from wealthy contributors had been collected
by Mrs. BACKUP. Reverend HAROLD BASS of Tacoma collected
$120.00, and wanted someone else to go instead of ZEFRA
(STUDAMIRE). RADER defended herself when TAIMI HALONEN criticized
her for bringing ZEFRA along since ZEFRA is at least six months
✓ pregnant.
"
After the demonstration, HEALY and RADER spent much
of the time urging the speakers to include in their talks some-
thing about the status of the American Indian. ELLA BAKER from
New York did include a paragraph from the paper the Washington.
State delegation submitted to Congress. This was entitled,
"American Indians and the Struggle for Peace". It had been
prepared by LONNIE HEALY although at its bottom it carried the
notation "(Prepared by the Jeannette Rankin Brigade Delegation
from Washington State)."
•
RADER, HEALY, and CORR became indignant because the
audience did not give a standing ovation to Mrs. MARTIN L. KING,
Jr. or any of the Negro speakers.

The first source went on to state the Seattle
delegation went to Room 132-A, Shoreham Hotel, Washington, D.C.,
early Sunday evening, January 14, 1968, where a Steering
Committee for the demonstration the following day was meeting.
Among those present were MARY CLARKE, Los Angeles, California%;B
JUDITH MORSE-EATON of Connecticut; and ELEANOR FRENCH of New
York who did not give any sign of being related to HELEN
FRENCH of the Seattle group. LONNTE HEALY inquired several
times about other Seattle people who might have arrived
separately. She also questioned the absence of Negroes on
the committee and sought to have a resolution adopted on
American Indians. In connection with the Indian matter she
distributed a leaflet, a reproduction of which is set out at

HEALY expressed great dissatisfaction with the
basic organization of the gathering. She wanted an organi-
zational meeting instead of a rally type meeting which
occurred. HALONEN and ROBEL agreed somewhat. HEALY implied
the whole thing was a waste of her time.
In the workshop section of the meeting, HALONEN
worked in the legislative action section%; HELEN FRENCH and
ELAINE HORSLEY in the electoral campaigns; and HEALY and
CORR in racism. Here, too, the younger women were very
critical. HEALY
HEALY, particularly, resented having men as
"resource people" for the group. She said she thought this
was a women's congress. TAIMI said she found herself in a
situation that was quite different in that she was working
with a very broad spectrum of politically and economically oriented
individuals and it was a real learning experience.. ELAINE
HORSLEY was anxious to get back home and work for peace while
the spirit of JEANNETTE RANKIN was still fresh. She and
HELEN FRENCH expressed the view the congress met the needs
of American women in giving a concrete program on which to work.

LINDA CORR and ZEFRA were too tired to get up so early. The
group called on Washington State's Senators JACKSON and MAGNUSON,
but they were not in their offices. After leaving a copy of
the women's petition and a questionnaire prepared by the
Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (see attachment)
they called on Washington State's Congressmen FLOYD HICKS and
BROCK ADAMC. Mr. HICKS was out of town. Mrs. HORSLEY knew the
'Congressman personally and her son knew two of the office
personnel. She asked that they relate to him that she was
vitally interested in peace and social justice.
Congressman BROCK ADAMS was in his office and spent
about twenty minutes talking with the group concerning his
political views and some of the political machinations of his
party. The group then began to disintegrate. ELAINE HORSLEY
left to get a 2:30 flight to Boston where she would visit her
son who is attending Harvard University.

anticipation of there being one more woman in the group.
BLACKBURN questioned each person as to her organizational

HEALY, HALONEN, and ROBEL all indicated they are with Women

troubles might be attributed to the fact STUDAMIRE is expecting
a baby in April. CASSIDY stated there were too many rules to
follow.
The delegates weren't premitted to carry a nail file,
wear peace buttons, or exhibit RANKIN buttons. They had to walk
six abreast and were not allowed to march around the White
House. She said a suit will be brought in court for this
denial of their rights. She went on to state each person had
or was given $10.00 to carry on his person so he could not
be arrested for vagrancy.
CASSIDY said a nurse, Mrs. HELEN M. COOK, had been
very helpful to the group. COOK told CASSIDY she could be reached
at 719 Beechwood Road, Media, Pennsylvania, if more information
is desired concerning Veterans for Peace, which was not further
described.
GUY RADER, a CP member at this meeting, tried to stop
CASSIDY when the latter complained ZEFRA STUDAMIRE was too
immature to have been sent to the conference, but CASSIDY wasn't
easy to stop. She was incensed over the fact money had been used
for STUDAMIRE's trip and the latter refused to cooperate. RADER
and STUDAMIRE remained in Washington, D.C. after the conference
to handle some business with the Student Non-Violent Coordinating
Committee (SNCC) according to CASSIDY.
SNCC is an organization which has concerned
itself with racial matters in the United

be united, remembering these differences had been built up over
hundreds of years and that one meeting would not solve all the
difficulties but could be a start in solving them. They
indicated it was a healthy sign when they could argue openly

INDIANS AND THE STRUGGLE F
1
Today, in Battle Creek, Michigan, the city's seal, adopted in 1561,
cit and violent because it pictures a white man hitting an i narmed
Indian with a rifle butt. Some Indian youth view the television program
Juster" as indicative of racist America. The National Congress of American
Indians opposes his distortion of history. Beatings and murder of Indians
in laine go unchallenged. Congress voted in 195 to open up Indian land
reservations to state jurisdiction. In actuality, this rides established
tribal courts and federal jurisdiction. It gives local bigoted authorities
more opportunity to harrass and open the way to termination of our treaties
and in several places resulted in actual loss of land.
It is as deadly to be an Indian in America as it is to be a soldier
in Viet Nam. In the three years before 1957, more Indian children below the
age of 16 had died in this country than the 6,628 U. S. combat casualties of
the entire Viet Nam War (as of the end of 1966). Most of these were children
below the age of six.
The price we pay is the built-in racism our children are taught in
school, over television, in cartoons; the Indian has become a joke to white
Americans. We pay because we don't know our own history.
The thread of struggle for self-determination runs through the history
of Indian-Americans. When a few Indian youth speak of Red Power, the roots go
deep into their history in finding nourishment for this demand. Just as some
Negro leaders today speak of W.E.B. DuBois as having raised the same issue of
identity long before the level of struggle, which is Black Power, arrived.
This struggle has gone on for 400 years.
The Indian people have been sending spokesmen to bring their grievances
and their positions before the power structure of this country for two hundred
years. They have fought in the courts since at least 1830 when the case of
the Cherokee Nation vs. Georgia tested the ability and the willingness of the
United States to protect an Indian Tribe in its efforts at self-determination.
The Vietnamese war is a continuation of the whole racist war we have.
waged against the Indian People. Understanding this is a part of understanding
the Viet Nam war. We respond to what is happening to Vietnamese children, yet
the Indian people have suffered from the same policy of extermination and
destruction of their identity.
We must unite with the strivings of those who have had to deal with
United States' genocide for 200 years!
We can help to push the United States to ratify the United Nations
Resolution, "Treaty Against Genocide", that the United States should correct
the history and policy of genicide against the Indian people. Today this
refers to the destruction of their identity as a people and linke with the
struggles of people for their identity all over the world. To stop the policy
of genocide, of racism, to develop compensatory steps to undo the effects of
the crimes against the Indian people, to remove the oppression of the Indian
people!

All the forces in this country cannot win democratic power without
maiting this correction of what was done to the American Indian people.

and unconstitutional infringement of their First Amendment rights to assembly,
free speech and the right to petition their government for a redress of
grievances.
Upon informing the Capitol Police of their planned march to the Capitol building
to present their petition, the women were threatened with arrest under 40 U.S.C.
193 (a) et. seg. which, after defining the area considered Capitol Grounds, states:
"It is forbidden to parade, stand, or move in processions
or assemblages in said United States Capitol Grounds, or to,
display therein any flag, banner, or device designed or
adapted to bring into public notice any party, organization,.
or movement…………
"
The statute further provides that exceptions from these prescriptive provisions
will be made in the discretion of certain Congressional leaders and/or Capitol
Police. The exceptions are allowed on "ocassions of national interest becoming
the congnizance and entertainment of Congress."
The petition of the Jeannette Rankin Brigade apparently does not become "the
entertainment of Congress" and arrests were threatened. Therefore the suit which
was files prays for the convening of a three-judge Federal District Court which
is requested to enjoin the operation and enforcement of the statute and to
declare it unconstitutional. We have asked the Federal District Court for the
District of Columbia to grant us this relief on an emergency basis prior to
January 15th. Our request was denied. The same request was made to the District
of Columbia Court of Appeals and was likewise denied. As it was then impossible
to obtain relief prior to January 15th the Brigade's attorneys are continuing the
appeal on a non-emergency basis in the Court of Appeals and have every confidence
of ultimate victory.
This is far from the last time that these women or any other Americans intend
to appear in their nation's Capitol to petition their government.
will be the last time that they find it so difficult to do so.

WELFARE FACIS
stery of Nodern Welfor
-rans
tern welfare programs in the United States began with passage of
The Scoial Security Act---in 1935, authorizing federal grants to
states for public assistance and child welfare programs, In 1937,
the Washington Legislature repaled the Paupers Law of 1854 and
enacted a State Social Security Law. "Welfare" ha
"Welfare" has been a bone of
contention ever since.
Greenleigh Report
In 1963, the Washington Legislature appropriated $20,000 for a study
of the state's public assistance programs. The study was made by
Greenleigh Associates, and the Greenleigh Report was presented in
December, 1964.
This report stated that public assistance grants in
Washington, with standar s based on 1959 prices and
12% ratable reductions, e 40% below the minimum
standards for health and decency. Speaking of child
welfare needs, the report said: "There is an excessive
and increasing rate of referral of children to the
Juvenile Courts, both for dependency and delinquency.
There is an excessive and increasing trend for children
to be removed from their natural families and cared
for elsewhere."
WHAT ABOUT RATABLE REDUCTIONS?
The 1965 Legislature removed the ratable reductions. The 1967
Legislature ordered the Dept. of Public Assistance to bring it's
pricing standard's up to 1967 levels.
New standards were put into effect July first. Increased allowances
for rent vary from county to county. Other allowances were increased
an average of 10-3/4% In King County the total increase was 16%.
Thus, King County grants have been increased by 28% since 1964,
but the cost of living has increased by at least 5%. Grants are stil
17% less than acceptable levels.
The maximum grant for a Seattle family consisting of
two adults, a boy 13, and a girl 8, is $285.80 a
month--$3,429 a year. But recent changes in the
Federal Social Security Law cast a shadow on even
this figure. The local welfare officials will not
^
offer any guess as to what may happen next. NEW RATABLE
REDUCTIONS ARE ALWAYS A POSSIBILITY.
There is much talk of getting people off welfare by putting them to
work. Yet who will take care of the children? Child care costs from
$60 to $80 per child per month in Seattle.
Some examples of women's wages:

WORKERS WORLD PARTY
On April 17, 1959, a confidential source advised
that on February 12, 1959, a Socialist Workers Party (SWP)
minority group under the leadership of National Committee
member SAM BALLAN, split from the SWP.
The source stated that this minority group,
referred to as the Marcyites, after many years of program
and policy differences on varied issues concerning tactics
and interpretation of political events, split from the SWP
on the grounds that the Party was liquidating itself by
departing from the Marxist precepts of LEON TROTSKY and
retreating from the fight for the world socialist
revolution. The final issue which ultimately forced the
split was the minority's opposition to the SWP regroupment
policy which involved cooperation with the Communist Party.
(CP) periphery-individuals characterized by the minority
as petty-bourgeois.
The minority program, according to the source,
advocated unconditional defense of the Soviet Union and has
as its goal the building of a revolutionary party with a
complete proletarian orientation for the purpose of overthrowing
capitalism in the United States and throughout the world.
On May 12, 1960, source advised that this minority
group had chosen the name Workers World Party.
On May 1, 1967, a second confidential source
advised that the Workers World Party, which maintains head-
quarters at 46 West 21st Street, New York, New York, supports
the People's Republic of China in its ideological dispute
with the Soviet Union.
The SWP and CP have been designated
pursuant to Executive Order 10450.

"Today, in every corner of the earth, laws deny
women the right to abortion, the right to decide whether or
not to have children. Now a new generation of women has
begun to stand up for our rights. The struggle for the
right to abortion is rapidly crossing boundaries of nations
and continents, of language and background. We have inspired
one another and learned from one another.
"In the United States women from many backgrounds
are uniting in this fight. On November 20, we will march
in massive numbers on Washington, D. C., and San Francisco,

"
"The coalition, which comprises about 30 women's
groups, will also demonstrate against forced sterilization
and restrictive contraception laws and plans to hold
national abortion hearings in Washington before the march."
First source advised on October 15, 1971, that the
November 20, 1971, rally has received mixed support. from
various Washington, D. C., women's liberation groups.
Several radical women's groups refused to endorse the November
20, 1971, action because they view it as a Young Socialist
Alliance (YSA)/Socialist Workers Party (SWP) Front which will
use these rallies to further its own recruitment drive.
Furthermore, they considered YSA/SWP to be "non-feminist".
Main support for the November 20, 1971, demonstration will come
from the WSA Women's Fraction Group.

This memorandum advises of demonstrations being scheduled in
Washington, D. C., and San Francisco, California, on 11/20/71 to build
public support for the repeal of antiabortion laws.
The Women's National Abortion Action Coalition was formed at a
conference held at Columbia, University, New York City, in July, 1971, which
was attended by approximately 1,000 women from 29 states. The conference
voted to make a woman's right to abortion a national and political issue.
Subsequent to its formation, the coalition called for demonstrations in
San Francisco and Washington on 11/20/71 to build public support for the
repeal of all antiabortion laws, to protest forced sterilization, and to call
for an end to restrictive contraceptive laws. A source of the Washington
Field Office has advised that the march in Washington is supported by the
Young Socialist Alliance, the youth group of the Socialist Workers Party
(SWP). Carol Lipman, who is a member of the SWP, is Project Director
of the Washington march.
D.C
**
Coalition leaders in requesting permit for the demonstration have
estimated that participation in the Washington march will range between
(10,000 and 20,000 persons. The Washington Field Office has developed
information that 46 buses have been chartered to bring participants to the
demonstration. Participants will represent some 80 cities. The Metropolitan
Police Department anticipates participation will be in the vicinity of 5,000 persons
REC-23.
Demonstrators are scheduled to assemble at the Ellipse between
7971
10 a. m. and 12 noon and will march via 17th Street to H Street, down H Street
to 15th Street, down 15th Street to Pennsylvania Avenue, and then east on
Pennsylvania Avenue to the west steps of the Capitol. A rally will be held
at the latter site between 2 and 6 p. m.

Vietnam and the money being utilized to carry on
the war in Vietnam be used to fight poverty in the
United States, provide better jobs in the ghetto, and
provide more welfare benefits for the under-privileged

Source three advised on March 3, 1966 that the Women's
International League for Peace and Freedom is a peace-
oriented womens' organization which is 'Anti-War'

are primarily active church-goers with a few former
Communist Party members. Women's International
League for Peace and Freedom's activities have included
demonstrations and distribution of literature opposing
the Vietnam war.

WOMEN'S NATIONAL ABORTION
ACTION COALTION (WONAAC)
"These groups, which joined in July (1971)
to form the Women's National Abortion Action
Coalition (WONAAC), are organizing a march
Nov. 20 (1971) in Washington planned to take
them past the White House, the Supreme Court
and the Capitol--institutions which they feel
can effect significant changes in existing
abortion laws. They are expecting what they
call a conservative estimate of between
10,000-20,000 persons, but are hoping for thousands
more.
"
On November 10, 1971, source one made available the
following leaflet issued by the Los Angeles Women's Abortion
Action Committee (LAWAAC), an affiliate of the WONAAC,
and annoucing a demonstration to be held November 20, 1971,
at San Francisco, California, to protest abortion laws and
forced sterilization and restrictive contraception laws.

SPONSORED DEMONSTRATION
November 20, 1971
Washington, D. C.
The WONAAC is self-described in its literature
as being formed by the national conference of
more than 1,000 women held in New York City,
New York, in July 1971. At that conference,
women from 29 states and 253 organizations came
together to unite their efforts in the national
fight for the repeal of all abortion laws and
for the corollary demands of no forced sterilization
and repeal of contraception laws. The conference
called for a massive show of force for these goals
in a march on Washington, D.C., and San Francisco,
California, November 20, 1971. WONAAC is based
on a program of legislative, judicial, and
mass demonstration activities on a local and.
national level, and seeks to unite all women in
the fight for the right of abortion.
The September 22, 1971, issue of the "Los Angeles Times"
a newspaper of general circulation published daily in Los Angeles,
California, contains an article on page 6, part IV, datelined
Washington, D. C., entitled "Abortion March Mobilizing", which
article states in part as follows:
"Women from 253 organizations across the country
are mobilizing for mass demonstrations here
(Washington, D. C.) and in San Francisco in
November to support the complete repeal of all
abortion laws.

The Young Socialist Alliance (YSA) in the
Los Angeles area (LAB - YSA) is actually the
youth organization of the SWP and follows
the SWP aims and purposes to the letter.
As the youth organization of the SWP, the YSA
serves as the main source of recruitment into
that organization. The YSA is described in the
masthead of its official publication, "The Young
Socialist Organizer". as a multinational
.revolutionary socialist youth organization."
According to the masthead of "The Young Socialist
Organizer" it is described as "A bi-weekly action

WOMEN'S NATIONAL ABORTION
ACTION COALITION (ORAAC)
It was ascertained by means of a suitable pretext by
a representative of the FBI on November 10, 1971, that the
LAWAAC plans to charter a bus from Los Angeles to San Francisco
for Los Angeles individuals interested in participating in the
above November 20, 1971, demonstration in San Francisco. The
bus is scheduled to depart Los Angeles at 10:00 p.m., on
November 19, 1971, and to depart San Francisco after the
demonstration at 10:00 p.m., November 20, 1971. The cost of
a round trip ticket on a bus will be $14.00.
The November 11, 1971, issue of the "UCLA Daily Bruin",
the official campus newspaper of the University of California
at Los Angeles (UCLA), 405 Hilgard Avenue, Los Angeles, contained
an article on page 2 entitled "Symposium Presents Views on
Women's Roles in Society", which article indicated that Dr. Barbara
Roberts was one of a number of speakers at a "teach-in'
symposium on women held at UCLA. According to the article,
Dr. Roberts talks about her work as a volunteer doctor in an
abortion clinic in Washington, D..C. The article indicated
that WONAAC would sponsor simultaneous demonstrations in
San Francisco and Washington, D. C., on November 20, 1971, to
protest abortion laws.
The November 12, 1971, issue of "The Militant"
contained an article on page 5 entitled "Building
for Nov. 20" which article describes Dr. Barbara
Roberts as the National Project Director of WONAAC.
"The Militant" is the weekly newspaper of the
Socialist Workers Party (SWP).
The SWP has been designated by the Attorney
General of the United States pursuant to
Executive Order 10450.
The above November 11, 1971, issue of the "UCLA
Daily Bruin" further indicated that another speaker at the
"teach-in" symposium of women at UCLA was Olga Kodriguez,
described by the article as a member of WONAAC. According

is based on a program of legislative,
judicial, and mass demonstration
activities on a local and national level,
and seeks to unite all women in the fight
for the right of abortion.
On November 20, 1971, Special Agents of the
San Francisco Office of the Federal Bureau of Investiga-
tion (FBI) observed that approximately five hundred
individuals, primarily young women in their teens and
early twenties, gathered at the Embarcadero, San Francisco,
California, and began marching at 11:10 a.m. from the
Embarcadero, en route to the Civic Center, San Francisco.
They carried signs such as "free our women" and "separate
church and state". By 12:30 p.m., the marchers had
arrived at the Civic Center where a female rock hand was
performing. A rally was held at the Civic Center from
approximately 1:45 p.m. to 3:30 p.m., addressed by indi-
viduals supporting repeal of abortion laws.
There were no
incidents or arrests with regard
to the march and rally, according to San Francisco Police
Department records, and the official police estimate of
the crowd attending the rally wes approximately eight
hundred individuals.
The Sunday, November 21, 1971, edition of the
"San Francisco Examiner", a San Francisco, California,
daily newspaper, in an article entitled "Pro and Anti-
Abortion Forces Hold Rallies", described HELEN MEYERS,
one of the speakers at the Civic Center rally, as
Regional Coordinator for WONAAC.

The WONAAC is self-described in its literature
as being formed by the national conference of
more than 1,000 women held in New York City,
New York, in July 1971. At that conference,
women from 29 states and 253 organizations came
together to unite their efforts in the national
fight for the repeal of all abortion laws and
for the corollary demands of no forced sterilization
and repeal of contraception laws. The conference
called for a massive show of force for these goals
in a march on Washington, D. C., and San Francisco,
California, November 20, 1971. WONAAC is based
on a program of legislative, judicial, and
mass demonstration activities on a local and
national level, and seeks to unite all women in
the fight for the right of abortion.
On November 28, 1971, source one advised that on
November 19, 1971, a bus chartered by the Los Angeles Women's
Abortion Action Committee (LAWAAC) transported approximately
fifty Los Angeles, California, area individuals from Los Angeles
to San Francisco to participate in a demonstration held in that
city on November 20, 1971, and sponsored by WONAAC to protest
abortion laws, forced sterilization, and restrictive contraception
laws. This bus left Los Angeles at approximately 10:00 p.m., on
November 19, 1971, and returned to the Los Angeles area during

Matilde Miles, nee Zimmerman, was the SWP,
Boston, member heading up Local SWP/YSA work in the
Coalition; and she and Evelyn Clark, another SWP,
Boston, member, had left or were planning to leave for
Washington, D. C., to help in organizing the November 20,
1971, WONAAC scheduled demonstration at Washington, D. C.,
and both planned to remain in that area through the
demonstration.
At a meeting of the SWP, Boston, held November 16,
1971, it was reported that the local BOWAAC was hoping to
fill four buses with participants for travel to Washington,
D. C., for the November 20, 1971, demonstration but that
a specific number of actual participants from this area
was not then known.

personnel on November 17, 1971, advised that telephone
number 547-1818 is listed to BOWAAC, 552 Massachusetts
Avenue, Cambridge, and that telephone number 491-1071
is listed to FL located at that same address..
At approximately 10 a.m., November 20, 1971,
Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) observed women who represented various women's
groups from cities in the United States, including Boston,
gathering on the Ellipse in Washington, D. C. At approxi-
mately 12:10 p.m., the group, then numbering about 1,500,
Was observed to march from the Ellipse to the West Front
of the Capitol;, and during the march to the Capitol, signs
carried by some of the marchers were observed to read
"Rhode Island Women for Abortion Reform" and "Boston
Repeal All Abortion Laws.
H
The Special Agents also observed that two tables
of SWP literature were set up during the gathering at the
Ellipse and four at the rally site at the Capitol. The
rally ended about 4 p.m. without incident:
The second source, on December 3, 1971, advised
that the organizer of the SWP, Boston, had recently re-
ported that between eighty to one hundred individuals
had traveled from Boston to Washington, D.˚C., to partici-
pate in the WONAAC November 20, 1971, demonstration.

and other women making the trip will pay all their own
expenses.
No expenses are contemplated while the women are
in Washington, D.C. inasmuch as arrangements have been made
for the women to stay with other WSP members in the
Washington, D.C. area. Source one advised that it is
contemplated all the women will stay in Washington, D.C. until
Tuesday, January 16, 1967.
Source one advised it was reported the women from
across the nation would gather at the Union Depot, Washington, D.C.
at 11:30 A.M. on January 15, 1968. Source one further reported
it is hoped ten thousand women will participate in the
demonstration. After the gathering at Union Depot, the women
will march in solemn procession, all wearing black, to the
steps of the capitol building where the petition containing
the redress of grievances will be presented to the Congress.
Source one further advised it had been reported that Representative
Mc Cormick and Senator Mansfield had agreed to receive the
petition. Representative Mc Cormick, according to source one,
had agreed to accept fifteen women in his office at which time
he would receive the petition, but source one advised the
JRB now wants Representative Mc Cormick and Senator Mansfield
to accept the petition on the steps of the capitol building
in order that they might get news coverage. After the petition
has been presented, the JRB wants the redress of grievances
read into the Congressional Record.
Further activities of the JRB while in Washington, D.C.
are to include a three hour "Women's Congress", possibly on the
grounds of Georgetown University.
Mary Clarke pointed out that although the original
intention had been to have only those women participate
in the JRB who were willing to risk arrest for civil disobedience,
she stated at the above meeting that no civil disobedience is
anticipated in view of the large number of organizations
participating who are opposed to such civil disobedience.
However, she further stated that individuals are not going to
be discouraged who might elect to create civil disobedience.

As the youth organization of the Socialist Workers
Party (SWP), the Young Socialist Alliance (YSA) serves
as the main source of recruitment into that organization.
The YSA is described in the masthead of its official
publication, "The Young Socialist Organizer,
1. as "A
multinational revolutionary socialist youth organization.".
The SWP has been designated pursuant to Executive
Order 10450.
On November 18, 1971, the confidential source listed
above and a second confidential source who has furnished
reliable information in the past advised approximately 15
individuals would be attending the demonstration in
Washington%; D. C., from Indiana University, Bloomington,
Indiana. The individuals traveling were to represent the
BAC headed by Paula Savich, Chairwoman and YSA member.
Included in those scheduled to travel were approximately five
or six members of the YSA from Indiana University and plans
were for individuals to travel in two Ford Econoline vans
Frented from U-Haul, Bloomington, Indiana. Original plans had
called for a bus to be chartered; however, the lack of
individuals signing up to attend the demonstration resulted in
the cancellation of the bus.
"
· On November 16, 1971, an article entitled "Abortion
Repeal March Plans Set" appeared on page 12 of the "Indiana
Daily Student", a local campus daily newspaper. The article
indicated approximately 40 students were to travel to
Washington, D. C., and that Student Body President Mary Scifres
had been invited by the WONAAC to speak at a rally on the
Capitol steps in Washington, D. C. According to the article,
Scifres had not decided whether or not to accept the
invitation. Paula Savich, Chairwoman for the local committee,

march be really big". She indicated that they were taking
reservations for the bus trip to Washington.__

On November 10, 1971, a confidential source who has
furnished reliable information in the past advised that a meeting
of the Young Socialist Alliance (YSA) was held at Indiana
University, Bloomington, Indiana, on November 2, 1971. At
the meeting, a discussion concerning the Washington, D. C.,
demonstration of the Women's National Abortion Action Coalition
(WONAAC) was held at which time Paula Savich, head of the
women's faction of the YSA and Chairwoman for the Bloomington
Abortion Coalition (BAC), gave a report. Savich stated that
bus tickets for the November 20, 1971, demonstration to be
held in Washington, D. C.., would be sold in Bloomington on
November 8, 1971. Savich stated that the local chapter,
which is the BAC, would be asked to assume fund-raising
quotas and help to pay debts incurred by the national
organization. Savich encouraged all YSA members, both male
and female, to travel to Washington, D. C., for the
demonstration. It was also discussed that male members of
the YSA would be expected to assume part of the transporta-
tion costs by YSA women who participated in the November 20,
1971, demonstration at Washington, D. C. According to this
source%3B the BAC is backed primarily by the YSA at Indiana
University and the Chairwoman, Paula Savich, is a member of
the YSA at Indiana University. The organization was formed
by the women's faction of the YSA principally for attendance
at the Washington, D. C., demonstration.

did send a statement which was to be read at the demonstration;
however, due to difficulties, this statement was never read.
According to source, between 15 and 20 persons actually
attended the demonstration who were from Indiana University.
On November 30, 1971; an article appeared on page 9
of the "Indiana Daily Student" supra, captioned "Women
March for Abortion Reform": The article stated that less
than the forty students who had been expected to attend the
demonstration actually attended. The article indicated that
the large number of persons expected to attend the
"
.
Washington, D. C., demonstration from all over the country
did not materialize. The article also stated that Student
Body President Mary Scifres, who had had to decline an
invitation by the demonstration sponsors to speak at the
march because of obligations at Indiana University, prepared
: a statement to be read. Her statement and several other
statements, however, were not read because of the lack of time
due to frequent breakdown of sound equipment delaying speeches.
According to the article, Paula Savich had expected a better turn-
out from Indiana University.
On January 17, 1972, the second confidential source
mentioned above advised that the BAC was not currently active
and that it was not expected to be active in the near future.
'unless other demonstrations such as the demonstration held in
Washington, D. C., on November 20, 1971, called for support
from Indiana University. According to this source, the
BAC had been formed principally by members of the YSA, namely
Paula Savich, who was Chairwoman for the BAC and who currently
heads the women's faction of the YSA at Indiana University.

On November 13, 1971, a source advised that the
Women's National Abortion Coalition (WONAAC) planned to
hold demonstrations at Washington, D. C. and San Francisco,
California on November 20, 1971. The purpose of the
demonstrations were to call for the repeal of all abortion,
contraception and forced sterilization laws. The Women's
Right to Choose of Maryland, the Baltimore, Maryland
affiliate of WONAAC was to organize busing and housing
arrangements for out-of-state women.
On Nóvember 22, 1971, a source advised that the
Women's Right to Choose of Maryland, working from 3028
Greenmout Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland, were unsuccessful
in attempts to generate enthusiasm for the WONNAC demonstration
among Baltimore area women. Therefore, the plan to charter
a bus for the purpose of transporting demonstrators to the
Washington, D. C. rally was cancelled.
On November 30, 1971, a second source advised
that the Women's Right to Choose of Maryland had been
formed as an "ad hoc" group for the specific purpose of
supporting the November 20, 1971 Washington, D. C. demonstra-
tion. The source further stated that the Women's Right
to Choose of Maryland ceased to exist, following this
demonstration, and is now defunct.

✓
On January 6, 1972, the first source made available
a one page leaflet distributed through the mails by the Women's
Bail Fund and dated December, 1971. The leaflet is a request
for funds for the Bail Fund with the notation that donations
are tax exempt. The leaflet, in part says, "The Women's Bail
Fund is one arm of the growing nationwide prison solidarity
movement. During the past year we raised bail to release over
120 women who have been imprisoned while awaiting trial..
On January 23, 1972, a seventh confidential source
advised that Post Office Box 637, Cooper Station, NY, NY,
is subscribed to by the Women's House of Detention Bail Fund
and rented by Mary C.Pinotti, 86 East 3rd Street, NY, NY
(Telephone 777-5823.)'
"
The third source advised on February 10, 1972 the
Women's Bail Fund is trying to obtain a grant from the NY
People's Life Fund (PLF), however, they have been advised by
the PLF that they may receive a loan rather than an outright
grant. The source advised the Fund participated in a
demonstration a month ago at the New York City Correctional
Institution at Riker's Island, NY, however, said its activities
seem to be limited. The source advised that two principal
activists of the Women's Bail Fund are Amy Lowenstein and Gerry
Tosca.

The NY PLF is a fund set up by the War Tax Resistance
(WTR) to grant loans or funds to local groups in
the NY area.
MEMBER OF SUBJECT ORGANIZATION
The WTR is a national organization which encourages
the non-payment of federal taxes as a protest to
the war in Indochina.

COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF THE
FIRST UNITARIAN CHURCH OF LOS ANGELES
HUENTIAL
A source advised on May 22, 1967, that the
+
premises of the First Unitarian Church of Los Angeles, 2936
West 8th Street, Los Angeles, California, have been utilized
for meetings by Communist Party members and sympathizers over
a period of years. Speakers and lecturers at the church
frequently espouse Communist causes or follow the Communist
Party line. Communist front group literature is distributed
at the church. The church is used by some Communist Party
members for 'mass concentration" work.
This same infiltration extends to adjuncts of
the church such as the Unitarian Public Forum and the Fellow-
ship for Social Justice, formerly known as the Unitarian-
Universalist Fellowship for Social Justice.
STEPHEN H. FRITCHMAN has been minister of the
church since 1948.
Reverend STEPHEN H. FRITCHMAN is described in
the Fourth Report, Un-American Activities Committee in
California, 1948, page 115, as a very active "Communist
fronter" and connected with numerous "Communist front organi-
zations and activities.
"
Membership in the First Unitarian Church does not,
of itself, connote membership in or sympathy with the Communist
Party.

APPENDIX
COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF THE
WOMEN STRIKE FOR PEACE,
Also Known As
Women's International Strike for Peace
A source advised on May 14, 1967, that the Women
Strike for Peace (WSP) in the Southern California area began
its operations in the late fall of 1961, as an affiliate
of the national organization formed in Washington, D.C. It
is a peace oriented women's organization which is opposed
to the present American foreign policy in Vietnam. It has
also sought legislation which would bring about the abolition
of the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HCUA). In
recent months the organization has sponsored demonstrations
protesting the United States involvement in Vietnam and
calling for the complete withdrawal of all United States
troops from Vietnam. In the spring of 1966, it was instrumental
in originating and putting into effect a campaign advocating
support for "peace candidates" in the upcoming 1966 Congressional
elections.
The same source stated that WSP is a non-membership
organization and has no officers. The organization is open
to women of all political opinions who are interested in world
peace. it maxes no effort to exclude from its activities
members of, or persons sympathetic to, the Communist Party .
and related groups.
The guiding force behind the Southern California
WSF groups is MARY CLARKE. A second source advised in July,
1955, that CLARKE was dropped from the Western Division, Los
Angeles County Communist Party (LACCP) in the Spring of 1955,
for personal reasons and not because of any political differences
with the LACCP. -
The first source advised that Southern California
WSP maintains its office at 5899 West Pico Boulevard, Los
Angeles. It receives mail through Post Office Box 19739,
Los Angeles 19, California.

female members of the YSA-TCG. The vast majority of women
in the state of Minnesota support either the repeal or changes
in present state laws on abortion. Members and sponsors of
MWAAC include professional women, medical doctors, lawyers,
municipal court judges, and others from all walks of life.

Individuals active in the women's liberation movement
in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota, of
responsible leadership positions within the community, have
recognized the sympathies of individuals such as Mary Hillery
and consider her to be a representative of the radical left.
As a result, Mary Hillery is considered to have little or no
influence in the women's liberation movement in this area..

600 individuals in attendance. The rally was addressed by a
number of speakers, including Matilde Zimmerman, representing Mas>

W. E. B. DU BOIS CLUBS OF AMERICA (DCA)
A source advised that on October 26-27, 1963, a con-
ference of members of the Communist Party, USA (CPUSA), including
national functionaries, met in Chicago, Illinois, for the purpose
of setting in motion forces for the establishment of a new national
Marxist-oriented youth organization which would hunt for the most
peaceful transition to socialism. The delegates were told that it
would be reasonable to assume that the young socialists attracted
into this new organization would eventually pass into the CP
itself.
A second source has advised that the founding con-
vention for the new youth organization was held from June 19-21,
1964, at 150 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, California, at

adopted. Approximately 500 delegates from throughout the United
States attended this convention.
It
The second source advised in September, 1966, that
Mike Zagarell, CPUSA Youth Director, stated that in Negro
communities the Party still supported the plan to build "left"
socialist centers and to solidify the Party base through the
DCA. This sce also advised in September, 1966, that Daniel
Rubin, CPUSA National Organizational Secretary, stated the Party ·
believes the DCA should have a working-class outlook and be a mass
organization favorable to socialism, socialist countires and
Marxism, and in April, 1967, advised that Gus Hall, CPUSA General
Secretary, indicated the DCA primary emphasis should be on
developing mass resistance to the draft.
A third source advised in September, 1967, that Jarvis
Tyner was elected chairman of the DCA on September 10, 1967, at the
Third National Convention of the DCA held in New York, New York,
from September 8-10, 1967.
A fourth source advised during August, 1967, that Jarvis
Tyner is a member of the National Committee of the CPUSA.
A. fifth source advised on September 21, 1967, that the
headquarters of the DCA is located at 34 West 17th Street, New
York, New York.

WOMEN FOR LEGISLATIVE ACTION
A source advised on May 1, 1963, that the Women
for Legislative Action was formed in 1952, claiming to be
an independent organization dedicated to non-partisan parti-
cipation in legislative and civic activities. Its position
in favoring or opposing legislation usually parallels the
position of the Communist Party and related groups. It also
supports legislation to abolish the House Committee on Un-
American Activities. Membership in the Women for Legislative
Action does not, of itself, connote membership in or sympathy
with the Communist Party.
Another source advised on May 11, 1967, that the
Women fo.. Legislative Action continues to be active in the

Re:
Women's National Abortion Action
Coalition (WONAAC) Convention,
February 11 - 13,
13, 1972
Boston, Massachusetts
On February 18, 1972, source, who has furnished
reliable information in the past, furnished the following
information:
A Women's National Abortion Action Coalition
(WONAAC) Convention was held on the Boston University campus,
Boston, Massachusetts, during the period of February 11
13, 1972.
-
Approximately 1,000 persons were in attendance
at this convention which was held to determine future action
of WONAAC and to allow diverse factions within the Women's
Abortion Movement to join ranks under one issue.
Female members of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP)
and Young Socialist Alliance (YSA) from all over the county
were requested by the national office of the SWP and YSA
to attend this convention in order to insure the effective
control of the convention by the SWP.
°
As the youth organization of the Socialist
Workers Party (STP), the Young Socialist Alliance
(YSA) serves as the main source of recruitment
into that organization. The YSA is described
in the masthead of its official publication,
"The Young Socialist Organizer," as "A multi-
national revolutionary socialist youth organi-
zation."
The SWP has been designated pursuant to
Executive Order 10450.

Re: WONAAC
CONFIDENTIAL
The SWP specifically wished the convention to
adopt a one-issue position, that being the complete
control of the female body by the individual female.
This specific issue, "women control their bodies" was
adopted by the women's organization and all other propo-
sals were rejected.
Workshops were organized for each of the many
separate racial and ethnic groups represented at the
conference. Workshops were based on appeal to the speci-
fic group intended and all were supposedly controlled by
the SWP.
A Black, Raza, Asian-American women's workshop
was held on February 12, 1972, with 35 persons attending.
Among the issues discussed at the workshop were the
attempts of democratic and republican presidential candi-
dates to capitalize on minority group attitudes in regard
to the abortion movement and the fact that minority groups
all to often find themselves without a voice when real
issues are involved.
Of particular importance to the group was the
La Raza Unida Party, a legitimate political party in Texas
which serves to unite Mexican Americans. Of equal impor-
tance was the Gay Liberation Movement, which the group
felt expresses the plight of gay females who do not want
children and are forced to live with men because of the
mores of American society.
Attendees agreed that the one issue of abortion
law repeal will serve to unite women under one banner and
more effectively serve the Women's Movement.
7
The convention adjourned after an agreement that
an "Abortion Action Week" would be held May 1 - 6, 1972.
This action would serve to keep public attention focused
on the need to legalize abortion and to seek effective

(Physical observation, Special
Agents, FBI, 1/13/72)
Second WONAAC Conference was held in Boston,
Massachusetts, February 11-13, 1972. Approximately 1,300
women attended the conference, which once again. re-established
and reiterated WONAAC's call for abortion on demand.
It was
noted during the conference that WONAAC had been unable to
create anything like a national campaign and that local meetings
across the country had been disappointingly small.
It was
pointed out that WONAAC had failed to attract the large numbers
of working women, housewives, and students concerned with the
abortion issue, including the majority of women's liberationists
and abortion reform activists. It was felt that the movement
could not succeed without the support of the working women.
'At the close of the conference, WONAAC strongly endorsed
the "Abortion Rights Act of 1972," which is to be introduced in
the U. S. Congress by Congresswomen BELLA ABZUG from New York.
This bill would override all laws which impose sanctions upon
those who choose to exercise their individual right to an abortion.
(WF T-1, 2/14/72)
a. Proposed Actions
It was moved and adopted during the above conference.
that WONAAC sponsor a week of local abortion activities, May 1-6,
1972, consisting of educational programs, legislative support,
judicial action, and culminating in local or regional demonstra-
tions on May 6, 1972, around the demand for repeal of all anti-
abortion laws and restrictive contraception laws and an end to
forced sterilization.
(WF T-1, 2/14/72)
In addition, the following secondary proposals were
adopted during the conference:

The article reported that discussion at the
convention had centered around whether or not to adopt
the slogan "Free Abortion on Demand; No Forced Sterilization"
or to focus on a single issue--repeal of the abortion
laws. It further reported that a proposal was presented
for an Abortion Action Week, May 1-6, 1972, to include
educational programs, legislative support, judicial
action and local or regional demonstrations centering
around the demand for repeal of all anti-abortion and
anti-contraception lows and an end to forced sterilization.
Jane Roland, identified in the article as
coordinator of the Boston Women's Abortion Action Coalition
said that whatever the conference does nationally, her
organization would be acting at the local level.

A fourth source on February 13, 1972, advised
•
The February 13, 1972, session of the WONAAC
Convention at Boston University began at approximatāy
9:00 a.m. and the day's program was in the form of
workshops held in about 8 classrooms in the College
of Liberal Arts, Boston University. There were
approximately 50 females in attendance at each work-
shop; and the maximum number of persons, all female,
present at any one time during the day would be estimated
at between 400 and 500. The workshops primarily related
to the building of WONAAC throughout the United States
fund rasing and regional work with ideas being exchanged
between individuals attending from such areas of the
United States as: San Francisco, Los Angeles, Detroit,
Chicago, Philadelphia, New York and Boston. The major
theme appeared to be how to strengthen an awareness of
WONAAC, which reportedly was in need of financial support. It
was also stated that there was a need for regional
travelers with cars who would be able to travel full time,
and funds would be needed in this regard. It was felt
that more effort should be placed in obtaining paid.

speaking engagements in colleges throughout the United
States as such action would not only bring in needed
funds but also help to spread an awareness of WONAAC
and its objectives among college students. The work-
shops were peaceful and no incidents arose.
Tables identified with such groups as Female
Liberation, Socialist Workers Party (SWP), Students
for a Democratic Society (SDS), Student Mobilization
Committee to End the War in Vietnam (SMC) and Young
Socialist Alliance (YSA) were set up in a hallway
of the College of Liberal Arts for sale of literature
or posters.
P
SDS was founded during June, 1962,
at Port Huron, Michigan, and in the
1960's functioned as the leading New
Left campus-based student organization
in the United States. From a stance of
"participatory democracy, the SDS
moved to a radical-revolutionary
position. It maintained a national
office at 1608 West Madison Street,
Chicago, Illinois, until February,
1970. Internal factionalism during
1969 produced three main factions:
Weatherman, Revolutionary Youth.
Movement (RYM), and Worker Student
Alliance (WSA). The Weatherman and
RYM no longer consider themselves
associated with the SDS. The WSA
faction continues to use the name SDS.
The Student Mobilization Committee.
to End the War in Vietnam (SMC) is
controlled by the SWP and its youth
affiliate, YSA. SMC initiates and
supports public demonstrations against
the war in Southeast Asia.

For the information of the Bureau and New York,
Informants
advise that there is a
Women's Liberation group at the University of Florida,
Gainesville, Florida, which recently sponsored an
Abortion Action Week rally, however, none of the
individuals associated with this Women's Lib group are
connected with any subversive organizations such as
Young Socialist Alliance or Socialist Workers Party.
They are merely Women's Liberationists, who support
the repeal of all abortion laws.
199
In view of the above, no active investigation
is being conducted by the Jacksonville Division of the
Women's Liberation group at the University of Florida, as
there is no present indication they are connected and/or
interested in subversive activities.

of approximately January, 1972 until school closed in
May, 1972. This source was contacted 5/16/72. He stated
also at that time that LINDA LOEW has been a close
associate of BETTY SACHS who is the leader of the Young
Socialist Alliance Chapter on campus at the University.
Informant stated that there was no organization formed to
his knowledge of a Womens Abortion Action Coalition in
the Binghamton area.
Other sources familiar with New Left activities
on the campus of the State University of New York at
Binghamton, were contacted during May, 1972, and two
sources advised that they knew of no organization of
Womens Abortion Action Coalition on the campus or in the
Binghamton vicinity during the past year.
Albany Division has had an investigation pending
on LINDA LOEW and a report is being written with appropriate
recommendation for administrative action on LINDA LOEW.
In view of the lack of activity of an Abortion Coalition
organization in the Binghamton area, no further investigation
is being conducted by Albany.

WOMEN'S NATIONAL ABORTION ACTION COALITION
Character: INTERNAL SECURITY COMMUNIST (TROTSKYIST)
Synopsis:
:
Informants advised the Boston Women's Abortion Action
Coalition (BOWAAC), the local affiliate of the Women's
National Abortion Action Coalition (WONAAC), was formed
during the late summer, 1971, out of the local Female
Liberation (FL) group. Its headquarters is located at
552 Mass. Avenue, Cambridge. BOWAAC is not a formal
membership group but there are approximately a total
of 20-25 females regularly involved in the group's work.
The Young Socialist Alliance of Boston (WSA-B) and the
Socialist Workers Party (SWP), Boston faction within
BOWAAC, which comprises about half of the activists,
were the controlling force. However, recent reports
indicate this faction has apparently alienated itself
from other activists and doce not new believe BOWAAC
can be built into a successful supporter group for the
• YSA and SWP locally.

ORGANIZATION
A. Origin and Objectives
The Boston Women's Abortion Action Coalition
(BOWAAC), the local affiliate of the Women's National
Abortion Action Coalition (WONAAC), was formed during
late summer, 1971, out of the local Female Liberation
(FL) group.
BS T-1
November 17, 1971
BOWAAC was originally a subcommittee of FL
in the Greater Boston Area but as of January, 1972, had
grown into a separate group whose specific interest was
in abortion reform. Individuals active in BOWAAC are
also active in other FL work; however, all individuals
active in FL work are not active in BOWAAC, with BOWAAC
being the smaller of the two groups.
ES T-1
January 12, 1972
WONAAC has been publicly described
as an organization of groups whose aim
is to effect the overthrow of existing
abortion laws and to establish free,
abortion on demand.

YSA, the youth organization of the
Socialist Workers Party (SWP).
The SWP has been designated pursuant to
Executive Order 10450.
The Boston SWP is the local affiliate

the national SWP.
While BOWAAC was not exclusively made up of
Boston SWP and YSA-5 female members, as of November,
1971, it was controlled by members of those groups.

MIMBER OF SUBJECT ORGANIZATION
MATILDE MILES, nec ZIMMERMAN, was the Boston
SWP member heading up local SWP/YSA work in BOWAAC but
she and EVELYN CLARK, another Boston SWP member active
in BOWAAC, were then in the process of leaving Boston
for Washington, D.C., to help in organizing a scheduled
November 20, 1971, WONAAC demonstration at Washington,
D.C.
BS T-1
November 17, 1971
KIMBER OF SUBJECT ORGANIZATION
The YSA and SWP in the Boston area have approxi
mately 15 of their female members active in FL work
with approximately six to eight in and the controlling forces
of BOWAAC. As of January, 1972, JANE ROLAND, who joined
the Boston SWP in late 1971, was heading up SWP/YSA work in
FL and BOWAAC as MATILDE MILES had not returned to Boston,
but rather transferred to New York.

January 12, 1972
In late January, 1972, TOBA SINGER and JANE
ROLAND, leaders of the local SWP/YSA FL faction, reported
that there was continuing trouble within IL with respect
to the control of that group by the SWP &nd YSA forces
and also the direction of FL into any kind of abortion
work.

war in Southeast Asia.
II. OTHER ACTIVITIES
MATILDE ZIMMERMAN, telephone number 547-1818
of "Boston Women's Abortion Action", 552 Massachusetts
Avenue, Cambridge, in November, 1971, chartered five
busses with a 45 person capacity each for travel to
Washington, D.C. on November 19, 1971. A $1,500 cash
deposit was made against a total cost of $3,500 on
November 15, 1971. The busses were scheduled to de-
part for Washington, D.C. at approximately 9:00 P.M.,
on November 19, 1971, from Cambridge with a round trip
cost of $18.
BS T-2
November 16, 1972
At a meeting of the Boston SWP held Novem-
ber 16, 1971, it was reported that BOWAAC was hoping to
fill four busses with participants for travel to Wash-
ington, D.C., for the scheduled November 20, 1971,
WONAAC demonstration,

}
During early March, 1972, TOBA SINGER reported
that at an increasing rate abortion work was becoming a
more important area of work than FL and that a
number of SWP and YSA female members were being trans-
ferred into the abortion work.
BS T-1
March 26, 1972
The stress of the SWP/YSA female members in the
general Boston area who are active in female matters con-
tinues to be away from FL and into BOWAAC with only two
or three remaining on the fringes to follow FL activities.
BS T-1
May 10, 1972
Recent reports concerning SWP/YSA faction work
within BOWAAC disclose that, as previously occured with
the Party's work within FL, those in the Party faction
have apparently alienated themselves from the other
females active in BOWAAC and for the most part have lost
any support from others not in the Party faction. Any
suggestions now offered by those of the Party faction in..
BOWWAC, which comprises approximately half of the activists
in the group, are no longer accepted, cause considerable
argument and there is evidence of "red baiting",
As a
result, the Party faction does not now believe that they
can build BOWAAC into any successful supporter type
organization as had resulted through Party work in the
Student Mobilization Committee (SMC).

The opening session of the WONAAC Conference,
held at Boston University, February 11-13, 1972, began
on the evening of February 11 and was in the nature of
a rally in Hayden Hall with approximately 600 individuals
present. Of this number approximately 50 werc males but
it is noted that this was the only conference session
to which males were invited.
The general theme of the rally was "How to
Win Abortion Law Repeal" and MATILDE MILES, mentioned
previously, was one of the two rally moderators.
Approximately 30 members of the YSA-B and/or
the SWP, Boston, wore in attendance at the rally.
The Saturday and Sunday, February 12-13, 1972
sessions, open to women only, were scheduled to include
workshops on such topics as national and local legisla-
tive projects, court action, forced sterilization, abor-
tion referral and clinics, campus and high school work
and the building of the Abortion Law Repeal Movement.

maximum number of persons present at any one time dur-
ing the day would be estimated at between 400 to 500.
The workshops primarily related to the building of WONAAC
throughout the United States, fund raising and regional
work, with ideas being exchanged between individuals
attending from various areas of the country, including
Boston. The major theme appeared to be how to strengthen
awareness of WONAAC, which was reportedly in need of
· financial support. Literature tables were set up on the
periphery of the workshops and among organizations iden-
tified with the tables was the YSA.

February 13, 1972
The "Boston Globe" in its February 14, 1972
edition carried an article entitled "Women's Group
Backs Abortion Bill" which reported that the above-
mentioned "Abortion Rights Act of 1972" had received
strong endorsement from WONAAC at the close of its
second national conference. The article reported that
to implement the endorsement, coalition chapters intended
to publicize the text of the bill, which proposed to
repeal all abortion laws, and to have speakers on legis-
lation at forums, teach-ins, rallies, and other educa-.
tional activities. The article further reported that.
the proposals adopted at the convention were: that the
coalition sponsor an Abortion Action Week, May 1 - 6,
1972; that a telegram be sent to the New York' Court of
Appeals and Governor NELSON A. ROCKEFELLER condemning the
Court's February 10, 1972 decision denying women on

The "Boston Globe", a daily newspaper published
in Boston, in its February 13, 1972 edition, carried an
article entitled "Abortion Strategy Discussed" which in
part reported that more than 800 women from across the
country had gathered for a conference at Boston University
the weekend of February 11-13, 1972 to plan a strategy
to win repeal of all laws that prohibit abortion. Accord-.
ing to the article, it was expected that the conference
would endorse the latest Federal bill to nullify all
state laws restricting abortion "The Abortion Rights
Act of 1972", to be introduced by United States Congress-
woman BELLA ABZUG from New York, The article reported
that discussion at the conference had centered around
whether or not to adopt the slogan "Free Abortion on
Demand; No Forced Sterilization" or to focus on a
single issue - repeal of the abortion laws. It further
reported that a proposal was presented for an Abortion
Action Week, May 1 to 6, 1972, to include educational pro-
grams, legislative support, judicial action and local or
regional demonstrations centering around the demand for
repeal of all anti-abortion and anti-contraception laws
and an end to forced sterilization.
JANE ROLAND, identified in the article as
coordinator of BOWAAC, was reported to have stated that
whatever the conference does nationally her organization
would be acting at the local level,
The February 13, 1972, session of the WONAAC
Conference at Boston University was in the form of
workshops held in approximately eight classrooms with
about 50 females in attendance at, each workshop.

Re:
National Women's Political Caucus (NWPC)
Policy Council Meeting
Source, who has furnished reliable information in the
past, provided the following information on July 3, 1972:
A Policy Council Meeting of the National Women's
Political Caucus (NWPC) was held in Washington, D.C. during
the period June 24, 1972 -
-
June 25,
1972.
The NWPC is a legitimate, loosely-knit, open
organization of politically motivated women
seeking equal recognition in the American
community.
During the Policy Council Meeting there were no
overt attempts by any organized group to influence the policy
meeting and there were no individuals present who identified
themselves as members of any organization which might be construed
as subversive and/or supporting any cause except legitimate
change.
Of significance, however, was the fact that literature
of the Women's National Abortion Action Coalition (NONAAC) was
present in brochures and pamphlets located throughout the meeting
area. All of the WONAAC material was geared to the abortion
movement and specifically the WONAAC conference scheduled for
Hunter College, New York, July 15 - 16, 1972..
WONAAC was founded in July, 1971. for the purpose of
forming a national movement of groups scattered
throughout the United States who favor and
now work to legalize abortion. The Young Socialist
Alliance (YSA) and Socialist Workers Party (SWP)
are playing a major role in WONAAC.
The SWP has been designated pursuant to
Executive Order 10450.

Re: NWPC Policy Council Meeting
As the youth organization of the SWP, the
YSA serves as the main source of recruitment into
that organization. The YSA is described in the
masthead of its official publication, "The Young
Socialist Organizer," as "a multinational
revolutionary socialist youth organization."
During the council meeting on June 24, 1972, Mary
Clarke, who is associated with the Southern California WPC,
an affiliate of the NWPC, advised a group of policy council
members that WONAAC had been using the Southern California WPC
name as an endorser of WONAAC. Clarke also stated that WONAAC
had passed out propaganda at a caucus rally in California and
were very effective at taking control of small gatherings.
The Chairwoman from Nassau County in New York, whose
name was not recalled, defended WONAAC stating that "they were
a good group". This woman's position was not supported and,
in general, WONAAC literature was not accepted by those persons
present. Jill Ruckelshaus, a new member of the Policy Council,
is reportedly concerned about the SWP's attempts to align
itself with the abortion movement and will be using her newly
gained position to fight SWP attempts at control of local
WPC groups.
The NWPC organizing brochure published by the NWPC
has been written to assist individual WPC groups in organizing.
The brochure lists political parties and para-political
organizations to be contacted by caucus organizers when forming
the nucleus of a WPC. Among those listed was the SWP. After
discussions at the caucus it was determined that the SWP should
be removed from the list. The new edition of the WPC organizing
brochure will not list the SWP; it has been replaced by National
Peace Action Coalition (NPAC).
The NPAC was founded in 1970 by members of the SWP.
Its basic objective is to unite masses of people
including labor unions, GIs, and the black
community in the struggle to end United States
intervention in Southeast Asia through orderly and
peaceful tactics.

ABORTION ACTION COALITION
PH T-1 advised on May 25, 1972, that Women United for
Abortion Rights (WUAR), 1115 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, Pa.,
telephone WA-2-0381, is the local affiliate of Women's National
Abortion Action Coalition (WONAAC) and that about two weeks ago
WUAR decided to change their name from WUAR to Philadelphia Women's
National Abortion Action Coalition (Philadelphia WONAAC) and that
they intended to utilize the same office space at 1115 Walnut
Street and the same telephone number. PH T-1 added that this
change was made inasmuch as the name WUAR was found to be unwieldy
and awkward and that it did not convey the group's affiliation with
WONAAC as well as the new name Philadelphia WONAAC.
An article in "The Sunday Bulletin," Section 2, pages
6 and 7, issue of October 31, 1971, listed the various candidates
for political office in the City of Philadelphia in connection with
the forthcoming elections. Photographs of the following individuals
appeared and background information contained under each individual
photograph indicated that all were members of the Socialist
Workers Party (SWP) and that they were also affiliated with the

The SWP has been designated pursuant to Executive
Order 10450.
PH T-2 made available information on January 27, 1972
which reflected that às of that time the Coordinator of WUAR
was SAMARA JAROSH.
I SURTET
PH, T-3 advised on January 14, 1972 that as of that
time SAMARA JAROSH was a member of the SWP.
PH T-1 advised on May 25, 1972 that it is difficult
to determine the actual degree of SWP participation in the affairs
of WONAAC in the Philadelphia area and that he was not aware of
any information which would reflect that Philadelphia WONAAC was
substantially controlled by the SWP. Source explained that the
abortion rights issue had frequently been discussed at many of the
recent public forum type meetings sponsored by the Philadelphia
SWP and held at the Philadelphia SWP Headquarters at 1004 Filbert
Street in Philadelphia. The discussions held on the abortion
rights issue indicated that the SWP felt that the capitalistic
system had used the dual issues of abortion and women's liberation
to keep women in a position of inferiority, whereas the socialistic
system being promoted by the SWP would be in favor of abortion and
women's liberation, and WONAAC would therefore naturally attract
members of the SWP to their organization.

The Women's National Abortion
Action Coalition
Confidential sources one, two and three, all of
whom have furnished reliable information in the past, advised
on July 18, 19, and 20, 1972, respectively, that a Women's
National Abortion Action Coalition (MCNAAC) Conference was
held at Hunter College, Park Avenue and 69th Street, on
July 15 and 16, 1972.
Confidential source number one advised that
New York City was picked for the site of this convention
because this city is considered to be the center of the most
powerful anti-abortion effort so far.
The WONAAC Conference was open to all women
who supported the Abortion Law Repeal Movement. Registration
was $3.00 per person. Housing and child care facilities were
available. There were approximately 800 women in attendance
at this conference.
Discussions held at this conference centered on
plans for (one)-future activity in the campaign to repeal
all anti-abortion and contraception laws and (two) to end
forced sterilization.
A discussion was held concerning the attacks
being made by the Catholic Church Hierarchy and other
anti-abortion groups against women's rights to their
own bodies.
.
WONAAC is aware of the fact that progress for
these matters will not come easy, that it will be fought by
various groups step by step all the way, therefore, this
conference was called to discuss all the different approaches
and to decide on the major direction for WONAAC to take.

Referenced letter stated that activities of captioned
organization in Philadelphia did not appear to be within the
Bureau's investigative interest and, therefore, no additional
investigation would be conducted.
"
As you are aware, the Socialist Workers Party (SWP)
and the Young Socialist Alliance (YSA) play a major role in.
Women's National Abortion Action Coalition (WONAAC) throughout
the United States. Although a source of your office claimed
he was not aware of any information indicating WONAAC in
Philadelphia is substantially controlled by SWP, four individuals
• whose photographs appeared in a Philadelphia paper, were
identified as members of the SWP as well as WONAAC. Based on
this as well as the established fact that WONAAC is, for the
most part, totally controlled by SWP/YSA, it is basic that
the activities of this organization be followed by your office.
You are, therefore, to reopen the case concerning
captioned matter and follow the activities of this organization
for the purpose of determining the extent of influence and
control by individuals who are members of SWP/YSA and who are
acting on behalf of these organizations. A copy of your
communications should be furnished to the New York Office, office
of origin in this matter, for information.

ALLIANCE
In defense of the SWP-YSA position at the
conference, Linda, Tenness, the SWP Presidential candidate,
spoke in behalf of the YSA-SWP. In awer to Rose Weber's
accusation, Jenness stated that all members of the YSA-SWP
were independent individuals with their own personal ideas
and viewpoints.
On July 15, 1972, a proposal was passed by the
Election Workshop which stated in part as follows:
"WONAAC welcomes women from all political
affiliations and views. We are united in action to
win our demands guaranteeing women the right to control.
our own reproduction functions.
"By uniting women of all political views we
maximize our strength. Any attempt to impose one political
view on everyone in WONAAC would only destroy our ability to
fight together on the abortion question. Therefore WONAAC,
as an organization takes no position on any candidates or
political parties....
11
"The political rallies which will no doubt take
place with increasing frequency around the country as
November approaches offer us a forum for getting our ideas
across to great numbers of women. Besides allowing us an
opportunity to force the candidates to take a public stand
on abortion, these gatherings give us a chance to publicize
both WONAAC and the repeal campaign.

The Agenda for the conference followed the
proposed agenda set forth by the Working Committee,
mentioned above, with the exception of a change in
the lunch hour and some of the workshop schedules.
-
Prior to the Saturday conference, a Socialist
Workers Party Young Socialist Alliance (SWP-YSA) Fraction
meeting was held at the Belmont Plaza Hotel on 49th Street
and Lexington Avenue at AM. Those in attendance at this
i Faction meeting were SWP-YSA comrades from NYC and from
out of town. The discussion at this Faction meeting centered
on the procedure to be followed at the conference by the
YSA-SWP members in terms of voting on various workshops and
what stand to take which would be more beneficial for the
YSA-SWP. This Faction meeting was concluded at approximately
9:30 PM.

The WONAAC Conference procedure continued
uninterrupted with votes on various floor discussions
until an interruption was made by Rose/Weber, a WONAAC
coordinator. She addressed all YSA-SWP members at the
conference, asking them what was their real reason for
being in attendance at the WONAAC Conference. She
accused the YSA-SWP of not being sincerely interested
in abortion rights, but rather being interested in what
was best for the SWP-YSA. She stated that because of
the YSA-SWP influence being enforced on the conference,
she was resigning as a NONAAC coordinator and staff member.
She stated that she detested the intervention of the YSA-SWP
in this conference; that the SWP-YSA has caused conflict among
the WONAAC staff and therefore, they cannot work out constructive
solutions to their problems. She also suggested that the "zero
Population" and planned parenthood have no voice in discussions
at this conference. Finalizing her accusations, she stated the
YSA-SWP members had no mind of their own nor did they have any
freedom of expression of their own. She stated that they only

The Women's National Abortion
Action Coalition
A National WOMAC structure proposal was
presented, which stated in part as follows:
Black,
All women are welcome in WONAAC:
Latina, Chicana, Native American and Asian women, gay
women, high school, college, and working women, women
from political organizations, trade unions, the military,
and communities across the country. We are united in un-
compromising struggle for our common goal: the right of
all women to control fully their own reproductive lives...
"The National Conference shall be the highest
decision-making body of WONAAC, and shall operate on the
basis of one woman, one vote.
11
"There shall be a National Coordinating Committee
(NCC) composed of one woman from each national organization,
area coalition, and group supporting and building WONAAC...
"There shall also be a Working Committee (WC),
which is a sub-committee of the NCC and which is composed
of the project directors or coordinators, the elected
national staff, and one woman from cach coalition, committee,
group and national organization supporting and building WONAAC
in the locale of the national office...
1:
In addition to the above, a proposal "that the
National Office of the Women's National Abortion Action
Coalition establish an emergency cash fund, from which to
contribute significant amounts of money to organizations
and individuals who are working to achieve goals compatible
with those of WONAAC..
"That the National Office of WONAAC, as its first
act of financial support, pledge $2,000 to the Kennedy-Schulder
suit against the tax-exempt status of the Roman Catholic Church,
since the Church has violated restrictions on its political
activity by lobbying for anti-abortion legislation.

The independents did not waiver in their firm opposition
to SWP-YSA control of WONAAC. Six national coordinators of
WONAAC were independents and decided to resign publicly at
the afternoon plenary session. They also decided to combat
SWP control of the feminist movement through the various
publications,

Weber, New York; Vicki) Eslinger, Columbia, South Carolina;
Nancy/Rolf, New York; and Ellen Shapiro, New York.
NY.
There were approximately 700-800 women in attendance ·
at the afternoon session. According to one of the SWP
leaders, these women were from 31 states and three countries-
Canada, Italy and Sweden. The states that had more representation
than others were Ohio, Illinois, New York, and Massachusetts.
Most of the problems and differences between the
independents and the SWP centered around approaches to abortion
law reform. The SWP was charged with always having demonstra-
tions and rallies and never doing any work through the legis-
lative process.
The independents stated that they were tired of this
hassle and that they believed there were more effective ways
to change abortion laws than carrying placards in the streets.
After the independent women publicly resigned in
front of the plenary session, two other coordinators announced
they were staying on. One was Barbara Roberts, the other's
name is unknown.
Linda Jenness made a final plea for the independent
women to reconsider. The removal of the independents from WONAAC
has debilitated the organization and most independent representa-
tives will be going back to their own cities to work for abortion
law change in organizations which have no connection with the
SWP.
The concern still exists, however, that WONAAC will
be able to collect monies in the name of abortion reform and

there is also the concern that women new to the movement will
join in a mistaken notion that they will be furthering
abortion law reform.
Independents vowed before leaving New York that
they would try to publicize activities from the SWP in an
effort to prevent this.
As the youth organization of the Socialist
Workers Party (SWP), the YSA serves as the
main source of recruitment into that organ-
ization. The YSA is described in the masthead
of its official publication, "The Young
Socialist Organizer," as "A multinational
revolutionary socialist youth organization."
'
The SWP has been designated pursuant
to Executive Order 10450.

"That the National Office of WONAAC pledged
$1,500 to the defense of the seven women arrested in
Chicago because of their alleged activity in abortion
counselling, referral, and procedure...

"That the WONAAC National Office maintain,
at all times, a fund-raising staff efficient enough
to meet the needs of the emergency fund at the same
time it raises sufficient capital to maintain the daily
expenses of the National Office and staff...

Confidential source number two related that the
evening plenary session of WONAAC occurred on July 15, 1972,
and it was immediately apparent that the Socialist
Workers Party - Young Socialist Alliance (SWP-YSA) group
dominated the meeting. Independent women who wanted to make
statements during this session were voted down by SWP floor
leaders and these same persons continued to vote as a bloc
on all issues.
The group of independent women from various geogra-
phic areas, that is those women who were not associated with the
SWP or YSA, went together after the plenary session was adjourned
and considered the problem of how to handle the SWP leaders.
While these women were not political realists in their goals,
they did believe in working throughout the existing system
rather than functioning with the SWP in their eventual goal
of revolution.
It was decided that the independent feminists would
no longer continue hassling within WONAAC. They did not want
to have decisions for them being structured by a male dominated
group. They also decided that money being collected by WONAAC
in the name of abortion law change was not being used for that
purpose, but rather to sustain members of the SWP-YSA.
The Sunday morning session, July 16, 1972, was
labeled "Meeting to Discuss Internal Hassles. About 35
independents attended and a few number of SWP-YSA members and
sympathizers were present. Independents there were from New
Haven, Boston, Detroit, New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, and
San Francisco.

REAL letter to New York, dated 8/30/72, wherein
Albany asked to be advised of any active investigation being
conducted re WONAAC, or if any active investigation is
warranted by Albany, FBI.
For the information of the Albany Division, the
New York Office is the office of origin, concerning captioned
organization. The Bureau has advised that as the Socialist
Workers Party and the Young Socialist Alliance play a major
roll in WONAAC throughout the United States, and inasmuch
as information has been provided that WONAAC is, for the
most part, totally controlled by Socialist Workers Party/
Young Socialist Alliance, the activities of this organization
should be followed, for the purpose of determining the
extent of influence and control by individuals who are
members of Socialist Workers Party/ Young Socialist Alliance,
and who are acting on behalf of these organizations.
Based upon Bureau instructions, in light of
information set forth in referenced Albany letter, concerning
DIANE PARRY, an Socialist Workers Party organizer in the
Utica, New York area, and her reported communication with
national headquarters of WONAAC in New York City. It would
appear advisable for the Albany Division to institute such
investigation, as it deems appropriate to ascertain the extent
of Socialist Workers Party/Young Socialist Alliance activity
in its division in connection with WONAAC.

The Bureau, by routing slip dated March 6, 1972,
advised that because of Socialist Workers Party (SWP) leader-
ship and interest in the above organization, this case was
to be kept in a pending status and its activities followed.
In accordance with the above instructions, the
Bureau is being furnished the original and five (5) copies
of a letterhead memorandum prepared under the title, "Minnesota
Women's Abortion Action Coalition."
The enclosed letterhead memorandum is classified
confidential because it contains information from MP T-1
through MP T-4, the unauthorized disclosure of which could

WASHINGTON, D. C.
JANUARY 15, 1968
A confidential source, who has furnished reliable
information in the past, advised on January 4, 1968, that
the Jeannette Rankin Brigade (JRB) with headquarters at
133 West 72nd Street, New York City, originally scheduled
a demonstration in Washington, D.C. on January 8, 1968, to
coincide with the opening of Congress. In view of the
fact that the reconvening of Congress was delayed until
January 15, 1968, the organization rescheduled the
demonstration for that date. The source stated that the
JRB is composed mostly of members of Women Strike for
Peace, a pacifist organization and is using the name of
the JRB only for this one affair.
The above source stated that individuals are to
meet at Union Station in Washington, D.C., at approximately
11:30 a.m. on January 15, 1968, and then walk in a "silent
procession" to the United States Capitol. Literature sent
out by the local office of Women Strike for Peace indicate
that the women will assemble at Union Station at the above
time and "in solemn procession and wearing black, we will
walk to the Capitol steps behind our delegation who will
present our ""Women's Petition to the Congress" demanding
redress of grievances."

According to the source, the group wanted to have
Speaker of the House McCormick and Senator Mansfield meet
them on the Capitol steps and accept the above mentioned
petition. Thereafter, the women would visit both the Senate

Members of the YSA-TCG have in the past, expressed
interest in the support of women's liberation as a matter of
policy. The anti-abortion, or so called legal abortion,
movement, is one aspect of this women's liberation movement
which continues to be of concern to members of the YSA-TCG,
both male and female. While the vast majority of women in
the State of Minnesota support either the repeal or changes
in present state laws on abortion, supporters of this repeal
or change also include professional women, medical doctors,
lawyers, municipal court judges, and individuals from all
walks of life.

decided that an International Tribunal was planned for
October 21, 1972. The International Tribunal would be
held in New York City, New York, and it was hoped that
plans could be made for a local tribunal scheduled to be
held October 13, 1972, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, after
which individuals would be designated to attend the inter-
national meeting scheduled for New York City. This“ July,
1972, meeting was the first activity on the part of the
MWAAC as a non-organized effort following the May 6, 1972,
rally.

MP T-1 on
August 9, 1972
Individuals known to be involved in the women's
liberation movement in the Twin Cities area of Minneapolis
and St. Paul, Minnesota, have, during the past six months,
shown little or no interest in the organization known as the
MWAAC. Former leaders in the women's liberation movement
have become aware of the SWP influence among the leaders of
the group, and have adopted a hands off policy from active
participation in the affairs of this group. While the
May 6, 1972, rally in St. Paul, Minnesota, was attended by
some 200 individuals, their attendance was considered to be
due to individual interest in the abortion issue.
MP T-2 on
August 17, 1972

SWP INFLUENCE
The MWAAC is not a committee of the TCB-SWP, nor
is it a part of the YSA-TCG. Women's liberation is a topic
of general interest and concern to the membership of the
TCB-SWP, and the anti-abortion standard taken by MWAAC is
one aspect of the women's liberation movement of continued
interest.

were to attempt to persuade Congressmen to lend their support
to end the war in Vietnam. The source indicated that the.
organization had written to Speaker McCormick and Senator
Mansfield asking to be met on the Capitol steps but Speaker
McCormick had answered by stating that he could not meet

date. The source stated that Senator Mansfield had not

Washington, D.C. Source stated that negotiations are
under way to rent the D.C. Armory for that time and they.

pretext, contacted an individual self-identified as CAROL
EATON at telephone number 675-9150, located at 150 5th

According to CAROL EATON, regular NY Coalition
meetings of WONAAC are held every other Wednesday evening
at Religious Center at New York University, 2 Washington

As the youth organization of the
SWP, the YSA serves as the main
source of recruitment into that
organization. The YSA is described
in the masthead of its official
publication, "The Young Socialist
Organizer", as "a Multi-National
Revolutionary Socialist Youth
Organization"
The SWP has been designated pur-
suant to Executive Order 10450.

NY T-2 on July 21, 1971, and NY T-3 on October 1,
1971, furnished information that over 1,000 women met in
conference at Columbia University, NYC, NY, on July 16,
1971, through July 18, 1971, to form a National Movement
of independent groups scattered throughout the United
States (US) who favored and had worked to legalize abortion.
As a result of this conference, WONAAC was founded.
B. Aims and Purposes
In the WONAAC national newsletter, dated September 16,
1971, WONAAC was self-described as a nationally coordina-
ted abortion law repeal campaign including legislation,
legal action, and nationally coordinated mass demonstrations
in Washington, DC, and San Francisco, on November 20, 1971,
for the repeal of all anti-abortion laws and corollary
demands of no forced sterilization, and the repeal of all
restrictive contraception laws. WONAAC claims to reach
all women, black; Chinaca; Latina; Asian; Puerto Rican;
native American women; campus women; gay women; high
school women; housewives; professional, welfare, and
working women; young women; women from churches, political
organizations, trade unions, the military, and communities
across the country.

SWP and YSA. These women attach more importance to their
political movement than to the Women's Liberation Movement.
And when 77% of the women in this country are for reform
of abortion laws, there is fertile soil for a political
party to build itself on. The SWP/YSA realizes this and
is taking advantage of it."

On August 5, 1971, a leaflet
captioned "F.O.C.A.S." revealed
in part as follows:
"A nucleus of about eight feminists
have formed FOCAS, Feminist
Organization for Communication,
Action and Service. FOCAS evolved
from the Women's Strike Coalition
(WSC), which the Socialist Workers
Party abruptly abandoned on May
25th in order to form the committee
for WONAAC. Since that time a
nucleus of women from WSC together
with like-minded feminists pre-
served the WSC in order to main-
tain and expand a multi-issue
action-oriented Women's Libera-
tion coalition in the NYC area.
Assisted by loans from supporting
feminists, the new WSC paid
back nearly a thousand of the.
three thousand dollars of debts
incurred by the SWP women who
had controlled the old WSC.

paper of the SWP.

Committee (SMC) and NÝ National Peace Action Coalition
(NPAC), both of which organizations they dominate, would
also concentrate in the area of the Women's Liberation
Movement through their influence in WONAAC.
The SMC is controlled by the
SWP and its youth affiliate,
YSA. SMC initiates and supports
public demonstrations against
the war in Southeast Asia.
NPAC was founded in 1970 by
members of the SWP. Its objec-
tive is the immediate, total
and unconditional withdrawal
of all US forces and material
in Southeast Asia.
"
NY T-7 advised on various dates, March 23, 1972,
through October 17, 1972, that activities of WONAAC were
dutifully reported and included on the agenda at regular
meetings of the Upper West Side Branch, YSA-New York Local
(NYL) during that period.
NY T-5 advised on April 18, 1972, that the leader-
ship of WONAAC was then dominated by the SWP.
NY T-7 related on July 7, 1972, that at a WONAAC
meeting held June 27, 1972, at 706 Broadway, NYC, NY,
starting at 6:40 PM, it was announced that even though
WONAAC previously had accused various female activists
working along with them in the Women's Liberation struggle
of red baiting because of the stand they had taken against
the SWP-Young Socialist Alliance (YSA), at present they
are forced to work with these individuals to help strengthen
the WONAAC cause.
At this meeting, certain WONAAC staff members
walked out and voiced their disapproval of the meeting
being taken over by a majority of SWP-YSA members.
They indicated that the SWP-YSA has no right to be in a
policy-making position in WONAAC.

UNITED STATES POLICY IN

JANUARY 15, 1968.
CONFIDENTIAL
Captain Robert Krahling, United States Capitol
Police, advised on January 3, 1968, that a delegation from
the JRB and their attorney, Joseph Forer, met with officials
of the United States Capitol Police on January 2, 1968,
concerning details of the proposed demonstration. These
individuals were advised by the United States Capitol Police
that they cannot demonstrate on the Capitol grounds in
a group or carry placards, as such activity is prohibited
by rules of Congress. Forer, as attorney for the group,
advised the officials that these women will be coming to
the Capitol as individuals and although they will be walking
together they can only be kept out of the Capitol building
if the police exclude all visitors from the United States
Capitol. Forer argued that such a demonstration on the
Capitol grounds is not a violation of the law by the
participants but a violation of the United States Government
in refusing to allow its citizens to present their grievances
to Congress,
Captain Krahling advised that in addition to
Joseph Forer, the members of the above delegation included
the following individuals:

NY T-7 on July 18, 1972, and NY T-11 on July 19,
1972, provided information that a WONAAC conference was
held at Hunter College, Park Avenue and 69th Street on
July 15, 1972 and July 16, 1972.
NY T-7 stated that NYC was picked as the site of
this convention because this city is considered to be
the center of the most powerful anti-abortion effort so far.
Discussions held at this conference centered on
plans for (one)-future activity in the campaign to repeal
all anti-abortion and contraception laws and (two)-to
end forced sterilization.
A discussion was held concerning the attacks
being made by the Catholic Church Hierarchy and other
anti-abortion groups against women's rights to their own
bodies.
I-
NY T-11 related that the evening plenary session
of WONAAC occurred on July 15, 1972, and it was immediately
apparent that the SWP-YSA groups dominated the meeting.
Independent women who wanted to make statements during
this session were voted down by SWP floor leaders and
these same persons continued to vote as a block on all
issues.
The group of independent women from various
geographic areas, that is, those women who were not
associated with the SWP or YSA, went together after the
plenary session was adjourned and considered the problem
of how to handle the SWP leaders. While these women
were not political realists in their goals, they did
believe in working throughout the existing system rather
than functioning with the SWP in their eventual goal of
revolution.
It was decided that the independent feminists
would no longer continue hassling within WONAAC. They
did not want to have decisions for them being structured
by a male dominated group. They also decided that money

"There were many members of the SWP and YSA at the
conference, and SWPers and YSAers are among those who
have worked most consistently for abortion repeal and to

1971,
NY T-5 advised on November 12, 1971, that a NY
Planning Meeting of WONAAC was held at LOEB Student Center,
NY University, NY, on November 11, 1971, to lay plans
for a scheduled November 20, 1971 demonstration in Washington,
DC. According to this source, this meeting was completely
dominated and controlled by members of the SWP..
NY T-6 related on November 16, 1971, that the Upper
West Side Branch of the YSA planned to send a contingent
of its members to Washington, DC, on November 20, 1971;
in order to participate in the planned demonstration there
on that date.
NY T-6 stated that practically all the members of the
uptown branch of the YSA, NY, were expected to participate
in this activity.
NY T-5 related on January 20, 1972, that the scheduled
November 20, 1971 march in Washington was "crucial" to
all SWP and YSA branches in that it afforded an opportunity
for selling of "The Militant" and other SWP/YSA literature,
and also afforded an opportunity for "intervening " in the
action via distribution of SWP Election Campaign literature.
NY T-8 on February 11, 1972, and NY T-9 and NY T-10
on February 14, 1972, provided information that a WONAAC
convention was held February 11, 1972, to February 13, 1972,
at Hayden Hall, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts.
The general theme of this convention was "How to Win
Abortion Law Repeal". NY T-8 stated that approximately
30 members of the YSA or SWP Boston Chapters were observed.
in attendance at this convention.
NY T-7 related on February 14, 1972, that because of the
de-escalation of the Vietnam War by the NIXON Administration,

anti-war work through the NY Student Mobilization

NY 100-174481
F. Membership and Finances
According to EATON, WONAAC does not maintain a
formal membership, as such, and financially exists only
through voluntary contributions. She stated that all
staff members, National and NY State, serve on a voluntary
basis, receive no salary, and get only a small "subsistance
allowance" which the staff has found necessary to supplement
with their own personal funds in order to get by.
G. WONAAC Affiliates
CAROL EATON stated there are presently 36 WONAAC
affiliates, also called "coalitions" throughout the US, and
that most states of the union are represented by an affiliate
or coalition.
II. YSA-SWP INFLUENCE AND CONTROL
OVER WONAAC
NY T-1 provided information on July 22, 1971,
that the First National Womens Abortion Conference was
held at Columbia University, NYC, NY, from July 16, 1971,
to July 18, 1971, which resulted in the founding of WONAAC.
NY T-l stated that it was immediately apparent that this
conference was taken over and influenced by YSA-SWP members
who infiltrated the various conference committees and
workshops which were established to help formulate the
main direction the Coalition would follow in the future.
NY T-1 stated that it seemed certain the YSA-SWP would,
in the future, dictate policy for this organization and
would be able to control the utilization of WONAAC funds.

On August 5, 1971, NY T-4 provided a leaflet

which was published by Feminist Organization for Communi-

change was not being used for that purpose, but rather
to sustain members of the SWP-YSA.
$
The Sunday morning session, July 16, 1972, was
labeled "Meeting to Discuss Internal Hassles. About 35
independents attended and a few number of SWP-YSA members
and sympathizers were present. Independents there were
from New Haven, Boston, Detroit, New York (NY), Chicago,
Philadelphia, and San Francisco.
The independents did not waiver in their firm
opposition to SWP-ŸSA control of WONAAC. Six national
coordinators of WONAAC were independents and decided to
resign publicly at the afternoon plenary session. They
also decided to combat SWP control of the feminist move-
ment through the various publications.
P₁
The six national coordinators who resigned were
JUDY SIPHERS, San Francisco; ANN CDAVIDSON, Philadelphia;
ROSEXWEBER, NY; VICKIESLINGER, Columbia, South Carolina;
NANCY ROLF, NY; and ELLEN SHAPIRO, NY.
There were approximately 700-800 women in atten-
dance at the afternoon session. According to one of the
SWP leaders, these women were from 31 states and three
countries-Canada, Italy and Sweden. The states that had
more representation than others were Ohio, Illinois, New
York and Massachusetts.
Most of the problems and differences between the
independents and the SWP centered around approaches to
abortion law reform. The SWP was charged with always
having demonstrations and rallies and never doing any
work through the legislative process.
The independents stated that they were tired of
this hassle and that they believed there were more ef-
fective ways to change abortion laws than carrying placards
in the streets.

EATON admitted there were some problems in
the past with regard to friction within WONAAC about SWP
and YSA influence. She stated, however, this matter, to
her observation, never seemed a serious one, and is quite
minimal today. With regard to the "walk out" of six
national coordinators at the July, 1972 conference in NYC,
she stated the walk out did not occur, in fact, because
of the SWP/YSA influence question, but rather because
those who walked out believed WONAAC should be a "referral
agency", while those who stayed felt it should not. By
referral agency, EATON stated she means an agency which would refer
callers to a specific location or place where abortions
could be obtained.
IV. PLANNED PROJECTS
CAROL EATON advised that WONAAC plans an inter-
national Tribunal march to be held in NYC, NY, from March 9,
1972, to March 11, 1972. She stated plans have not yet been
finalized, including the exact location or site this event
will take place. However, she noted that SIMONE BEAUVOIR,
a Parisian, well known in the Women's Liberation Movement,
would be honorary chairwoman.

§
After the independent women publicly resigned in
front of the plenary session, two other coordinators announced
they were staying/on. One was BARBARA ROBERTS, the other's
name is unknown.
ER OF SUBJECT ORCHINECTION
A
MANEER OF SUBJEST ONGANLIATION
LINDA DENNESS made a final plea for the indepen-
dent women to reconsider. The removal of the independents
from WONAAC has debilitated the organization and most
independent representatives will be going back to their
own cities to work for abortion law change in organizations
which have no connection with the SWP.
The concern still exists, however, that WONAAC will
be able to collect monies in the name of abortion reform
and there is also the concern that women new to the move-
ment will join in a mistaken notion that they will be
furthering abortion law reform.
Independents vowed before leaving NY that they
would try to publicize activities from the SWP in an
effort to prevent this.
III. OBSERVATION OF CURRENT NATIONAL
STAFF MEMBER REGARDING YSA/SWP INFLUENCE
When contacted under pretext on November 24,
1972, CAROL EATON, self-identified as a current National
Staff member, and previously mentioned in this report,
related that she has been active in WONAAC since its
inception. EATON, while averring she is definitely not a
YSA, SWP, or member of any "radical group", acknowledged
there always have been SWP, YSA and "radical" elements
in WONAAC. She went on to state, however, that WONAAC
has never allied itself politically with any organization
or individual, including any of the political candidates
in the recent political election and, despite its diverse
makeup as too ideaological beliefs of its membership,
WONAAC is basically an organization which strives only
to the objectives for which it was originally founded.
To this end, she went on, WONAAC would accept help from
whatever source offered.

ReALlet to NY, dated 10/31/72.
Attached for the information of the Albany
Division is a copy of a flyer obtained by the New York
Office, published by the National Office of WONAAC and
calling attention and urging the attendance of recipients
to legislative hearings on abortion, scheduled to be held
in the state capital building in Albany, New York, on
January 30, 1973. The flyer indicated that testimony
would be heard from medical and legal experts on abortion
along with reports from women who have had legal as well
as illegal abortions. Those attending were urged to visit
their legislators in the morning and attend the hearing in
the afternoon.
On 1/9/73, SA WILLIAM R. CLOUGH, utilizing a
pretext of an anonymous newspaper reporter, ascertained from
an unknown female at National Office of WONAAC, located at
150 Fifth Avenue, New York City, New York (telephone 212-
675-9150), that several hundred women were expected to attend
the aforementioned hearings and that several buses accommodating,
most of these individuals were scheduled to leave from Union
Square West, New York, New York, at 7 and 8 a.m. on 1/30/73.
This unknown individual stated she had reason to
believe that those attending the hearings under the auspices
not
of WONAAC would conduct. themselves in other than a peaceful
manner.
Albany will, through logical informants or established
sources, furnish any pertinent information developed re this
matter.

Referenced letter stated that a flier was passed
out at an antiwar rally in Philadelphia on 10/26/72 revealing
that the WONAAC had moved to offices located on the third
floor at Houston Hall, University of Pennsylvania,
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and that the telephone service
for this office was subscribed to by the University of
Pennsylvania.
In regard to your request to continue attempts
to develop information regarding WONAAC, an organization
dominated and controlled by the Socialist Workers Party
(SWP), considering it now utilizes offices at the University
of Pennsylvania, you are authorized to continue your
investigation. You should, however, restrict your
investigation to determining the degree of infiltration
and domination of this organization by SWP or its youth
arm, the Young Socialist Alliance (YSA). This investigation
must be conducted in a most discreet manner and limited
to established sources. No action is to be taken by you
which could in any way be construed as infringement by the
FBI on academic freedom at the University of Pennsylvania.
It is noted by the Bureau that the above
information was received by your office on 10/26/72, however,
your request was not submitted to the Bureau until 1/31/73,
a period in excess of 90 days. Although it is recognized
there may be other matters requiring more immediate attention,
the delay in this instance appears unreasonable. In the
future, insure that these matters are handled on a more
timely basis.

representatives of political organizations,

Re Minneapolis letter and letterhead memorandum
dated 9/21/72.
The Minnesota Supreme Court on 2/2/73 declared the
state's abortion law unconstitutional in its entirety
based on the 1/22/73 decision of the U.S. Supreme Court
wherein it was ruled that the states cannot prohibit abortions
during the first six months of pregnancy.
The decision of the Minnesota Supreme Court has
resulted in several Twin Cities area hospitals in Minneapolis
and St. Paul, Minnesota, offering facilities and providing
necessary procedures for staff members to perform abortions
under these court rulings.
INFORMANT, who has furnished reliable information
in the past, has advised that the object of the captioned
group was to remove anti-abortion laws from the books in the
state of Minnesota, as well as in the United States.
On 2/16/73 "this source further related that the
Women's Liberation Movement supporters in the Twin Cities
area have generally reacted favorably to the court decisions
relating to abortion laws and now that the principal object
of the Minnesota Abortion Action Coalition has been achieved,
the influence of its spokesmen is expected to decline.

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION
Washington, D.C. 20535
March 2, 1973
WOMEN'S NATIONAL ABORTION
ACTION COALITION (WONAAC)
During the latter part of February, 1973, a confidential
source, who has furnished reliable information in the past,
advised that the Washington, D.C. (WDC) Chapter of the Women's
National Abortion Action Coalition (D.C. WONAAC) is scheduled
to participate in an "International Woman's Day Solidarity
Meeting" scheduled to be held in New York City, New York on
Saturday, March 10, 1973, place to be announced.
The national office of WONAAC is located at
150 Fifth Avenue, New York City, New York.
WONAAC goals are self-defined as "working
on a national scale to make abortion legal,
to end restrictive contraception laws, and
to end forced sterilization."
According to the above source, a flyer distributed
by D.C. WONAAC disclosed that among those individuals
scheduled to speak at the meeting are; GISELE HALIMI, described
as a leader of "Choisir," a French abortion rights organization;
MICHELE CHEVALIER, described as a defendent in a French abortion
trial; and CLAUDE SERVAN SCHREIBER, described as a feminist
journalist and as a leader of "Choisir".
According to the above source, members of the
WDC Locals of the Young Socialist Alliance (YSA) and the
Socialist Workers Party (SWP) have been urged to participate
in the International Womans Day Solidarity Meeting.
As the youth organization of the SWP, the
YSA serves as the main source of recruitment
into that organization. The YSA is
described in the masthead of its official
publication "The Young Socialist Organizer",
as "A multinational revolutionary socialist
youth organization."
The SWP has been designated pursuant to
Executive Order 10450.

There are, however, currently a limited number of activists,

work. The number of activists is currently limited as

article entitled "Petition Filed for Vote on Abortion,
which reported that representatives of an Abortion
Referendum Committee had announced on September 7, 1972,
the filing of a petition to allow Massachusetts citizens
to vote on whether abortion should be legalized.
According to the article, representatives of BOWAAC
were among supporters of this Abortion Referendum
Committee.
A leaflet entitled "Speak Outrage - A Woman's
Right to Choose a Public Hearing" was distributed to the
public in the general Boston area during October, 1972,
to advertise a meeting at the Boston University, Boston,
Law Auditorium under the joint sponsorship of BOWAAC and
Female Liberation on October 28, 1972. According to the
leaflet, women would testify at this gathering against
persons or institutions which had victimized hem with
legal or illegal abortions or had denied them contraception,
voluntary sterilization or good pre-natal care, or had
sterilized them without their knowledge or consent.
Among the listed speakers was JANE ROLAND,
identified as a member of BOWAAC, who was to speak on the
topic, "Summary and Indictments.
"The Militant" in its November 10, 1972,
edition carried an article which reported that on
October 28, 1972, 300 women had gathered at the Law
Auditorium of Boston University to hear testimony on
"Crimes Against Women. The article reported that the
program, entitled "Speak Outrage, was built by "Speak
Outrage Project," a committee of individuals from several
groups in the Boston area, one of which was identified
as BOWAAC.

The article reported that topics covered in

to poor pre-natal care and that presentations were given
by women of diverse ages and economic and religious groups.
The "Observer," a campus newspaper of Tufts
University, Medford, Massachusetts, in its November 3,

In view of instructions set forth in Bureau
memorandum 10-73, dated 3/6/73, paragraph G, wherein the
Bureau reiterated its policy that the FBI has no interest
in individuals and organizations involved in legitimate
dissent and the recent United States Supreme Court decision
upholding the right to abortion, it appears continued
investigation of WONAAC as such is not justified.
The New York Office further concurs with the
Philadelphia view that continued investigation of the SWP
and/or YSA would produce the desired cover age and information
concerning its members who are associated or active in WONAAC.
UACB, the New York Office is closing the investigation
of this organization.

Re New York letter to the Bureau, 6/6/72; Bureau 0-7
to New York, 7/12/72; and Philadelphia letter to the Bureau,
2/28/73.
C
As outlined in referenced New York letter, the
New York Office noted, as far back as June, 1972, it
recognized that, although several leaders of WONAAC were
known to be SWP members, their activities, as pertaining to
MONAAC, had been directed toward the legal repeal of all
restrictive abortion laws, and investigation had disclosed
no indication that WONAAC, as an organization, had engaged in
any subversive or vidence prone activity.
Referenced Bureau 0-7, referencing the aforementioned
communication, nevertheless instructed that the New York Office,
as office of origin, had overall responsibility for captioned.
organization, and directed the New York Office to reopen its
case and submit semi-annual reports.
A review of the results of the continuing investigation
of WONAAC, together with all indices and references pertaining
thereto, since June 1972, reflects no apparent change in the
activities or the organization or its membership from that
outlined above.
The New York Office is in accord with the view of the
Philadelphia Division, as set forth in its referenced letter,
that WONAAC represents basically a social change vehicle which,
despite disparate political views of its leaders and membership,
deals with the single issue of abortion rights.

Rephlet 2/28/73.
The Women's National Abortion Action Coalition (WONAAC)
has been the subject of a separate investigation by the Bureau
in numerous offices. In referenced letter, Philadelphia pointed
out that WONAAC represents a basic social change dealing with
abortion rights and that in view of the fact the U.S. Supreme
Court upheld the right of abortion, the continued investigation
of WONAAC at this time does not appear to be desirable and
should be discontinued. Philadelphia also suggested that
continued investigation of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP)
and its youth group, the Young Socialist Alliance (YSA), should
determine pertinent activities of WONAAC.
After careful consideration of this matter, the Bureau
agrees with the observations of the Philadelphia Office that the
investigation of WONAAC should be discontinued. However, in view
of the fact that WONAAC is dominated and controlled by the SWP, a
Trotskyist communist organization cited by the Attorney General
pursuant to Executive Order 10450, it is the responsibility of the
Bureau to investigate and report pertinent information relating
to the extent of SWP domination and control of captioned
organization.
Therefore, recipients should close separate
investigations concerning WONAAC. In the future, report above-
described information regarding WONAAC under appropriate subheading
in the SWP semiannual organizational reports.

Re Philadelphia letter to Bureau dated 1/31/73
and Bureau letter to Philadelphia dated 2/12/73.
For the information of New York, referenced Bureau
letter to Philadelphia dated 2/12/73 authorized a continued
investigation of WONAAC utilizing only established sources,
The Bureau further advised that the investigation was to be.
conducted in a most discreet manner and that no action was
to be taken which could in any way be construed as infringement
by the FBI on academic freedom at the University of Pennsylvania,
The case file of captioned organization has been
reviewed as well as all indices references to captioned
organization and it has been determined that while some of
the individuals associated with WONAAC in the Philadelphia
area are also known to be affiliated with the Socialist
Workers Party (SWP) and for the Young Socialist Alliance
(YSA), the majority of WONAAC supporters appear to be
individuals interested in social change rather than revolu̟-

In view of the fact that WONAAC represents basically

Court decision upheld the right to abortion, thereby reducing
the political value of this issue, it would appear that a
continued investigation of WONAAC at this time is not
"desirable.

This folder reflected women's disagreement with

and states, in part, as follows:
to us.
"Our sisters in Vietnam have stretched forth a hand
They are our example. We answer them with our strength
together. Women are marching against the Pentagon on April
10. With dignity and rage we march against the American
Medical Association and its health system that cares nothing
about the health of the people. We march against the
partnership between police and organized crime, which makes
heroin a big business-----silently endorsed by those who

·
"Grant's Tomb" a community newspaper, upper west
side, New York City (NYC), March, 1971, Number 2 Issue, page
10, contained an article captioned, "Women March on
Washington" This article reflected, in part, as follows:
"Out of the outrage against the war that was the unifying
force of the Ann Arbor conference, the women's caucus decided
to channel our frustration into a public statement calling for
a women's march on Washington, D.C. on April 10. We all felt
the urgency to show how we as women feel oppressed by the same
U.S. system that needs the dominance of men over women, white
over black, brown and, yellow, heterosexual over homosexual, and
over poor to support the aggressive war policy that is killing
our Vietnamese sisters and brothers.
"We are making this march one step in showing the
world our solidarity, as women with all our sisters in Vietnam
who are fighting for their lives. The Committee to Defend the
Right to Live, a South Vietnamese women's organization, has
called for our support.
The confidential source mentioned above on March
15, 1971, furnished information that on March 11, 1971, a
"women's meeting" was held at Washington Square Methodist
Church, 135 West 4th Street, New York, New York (NY).
Approximately 70 people were present. It appears to the source
that the Pentagon action April 10th is being led by the same
women, in the Women's Union" who are planning the trip to
Toronto, Canada in late March, 1971. The only decision arrived
at during the meeting, according to the source, was that on
the scheduled date, April 10th, there will be a march on the
Pentagon.

Reference is made to New York memorandum
dated March 16, 1971.
br
On March 24, 1971, a source, who has furnished
reliable information in the past, advised that on March 22,
1971, a "Committee for April 10" held a meeting at the Law
Commune Office, 640 Broadway, New York City (NYC), which
was attended by 30 to 40 females. It was learned that a
woman from the New York (NY) group was already in Washington,
D.C. working with others there to arrange permits, speakers,
et cetera, for the womens march on the Pentagon on April 10,
1971. It was stated that it was easier to obtain a permit
for a march from the Justice Department to the Pentagon,
than from the Pentagon to the Justice Department, but that
no permit had been obtained as yet. It was pointed out that
a march from the Pentagon to the Justice Department was
preferred as there would be less chance of losing marchers
en route to the Justice Department than from marching
from the Justice Department to the Pentagon. It was stated
that no buses had been chartered at NY, but it was hoped that
15 buses would be needed.

Women's National March
CONFIDENTIAL
on the Pentagon, April 10, 1971
Law Commune
On September 16, 1969, a second source, who
has furnished reliable information in the
past, advised that the Law Commune is not an
organization in the usual sense of the word.
It is rather a law firm comprised of a group
of lawyers interested and sympathetic to the
New Left and Black Power organizations, and who
counsel and defend individuals in these groups
as the occasion arises. They likewise permit
their premises to be used on occasion as a meeting
place for these organizations and distribute
some of their literature.
On March 25, 1971, the second advised that as of
now there is much confusion over the mechanical aspects of
the Women's National March on April 10, 1971, and that the
people in Washington, D.C. will make the ultimate decision
regarding the route of the march. The source stated that
in NY, information concerning buses for Washington, D.C.
will be available at the Upper West Side Women's Center,
627 Amsterdam Avenue, NYC, telephone number 874-6696.
On March 24, 1971, the second source made available
a piece of literature sent out by the "April 10 Women's
Committee" concerning the national women's march on the
Pentagon on April 10. This literature contained in part as
follows:
"We are going to the Pentagon on April 10 to
serve notice on our enemies that women are moving against
them. Our urgency and our fury at the expansion of the
Indochinese war and our rage at the repression of our black
and brown sisters and brothers needs expression right now.
We are joining with other women to struggle for the everyday
things we need and against whatever and whoever prevents us
from getting them.
"We need and want our sisters around the country
to build for this action in their own ways, and to communicate
with other sisters their ideas, suggestions and criticisms.
This is a temporary contact list which came out of the Ann
Arbor Conference:

WOMEN FOR PEACE aka
Women Strike for Peace
The "Berkeley Daily Gazette, a daily newspaper of
general circulation published in Berkeley, California,
contained an article in the November 19, 1965, evening
edition reflecting that in November, 1961, when con-
cern mounted over radioactive fallout from nuclear
testing, a group of women in Washington, D. C. started
Women Strike for Peace. The idea spread rapidly through-
out the country and now embraces 900 groups, including
Women For Peace groups in the San Francisco Bay area.
These groups support programs to achieve goals such as:
Continued disarmament negotiations.
(1)
(2)
A strong and flexible United Nations...
(3) Planning now at state and national levels for
conversion to peace-time economy and positive
efforts to ease world tensions.
The women act as individuals and as a group, with specific
actions suggested by individuals and groups from all over
the world. Decision to participate jointly on any given
suggestion is democratly arrived at by members of the Co-.
ordinating Committee. Effective cooperation with other
peace groups is encouraged. Monthly Coordinating Committee
meetings and general meetings, as warranted, are open to
all and announced in mailings to members. There are no
dues or membership forms nor conditions for membership.
.
To stir an awareness of the need for peace, Women For
Peace encourage public education in peace objectives at
local schools and sponsor peace-oriented demonstrations
and public meetings, newspaper ads, billboards, and
candidates for public office. On the national level
the group attempts to influence government officials
by letters and conferences.

Women's National March
on the Pentagon, April 10, 1971
Reference is made to New York (NY) memorandum
dated March 26, 1971.
On March 30, 1971, a source, who has furnished
reliable information in the past, advised that on March
26, 1971, a "Committee for April 10" held a meeting at
the McIntosh Student Union, Barnard College, New York City
(NYC), to plan and organize for the Women's March on the
Pentagon on April 10, 1971. The meeting was attended by
30 individuals and had no chairman.
The source stated that at the above meeting, two
representatives, man and wife, from an "Action Committee"
on certain islands near Okinawa, planned a march on April
10, 1971 in Washington, D.C. to protest giving over to
Japan what they feel to be Chinese islands. This march is
to begin at 1:00 p.m. at the Washington Monument, up
Massachusetts Avenue to the State Department, and possibly
on to the Japanese Embassy. Support of the women's group
was requested; however, after the two left the meeting, the
"Committee for April 10" decided not to support the Chinese
march on the grounds that they were too "liberal.

Women's National March on
the Pentagon, April 10, 1971
The source advised that at the above meeting, it
was stated that no permit had been obtained as yet for the
Women's March on the Pentagon on April 10, 1971.
It was
stated that the march will proceed from a "grassy spot" at the
Justice Department at noon, past the Bureau of Indian Affairs,
Department of the Interior, Department of Labor and on to
the Pentagon. An hour at each end of the march would be
allowed for speakers, though the group doubted they would use
it. Guerrilla theatre activity by participating groups in
front of the various government buildings was discussed and·
encouraged, though specifics were not mentioned.
The source stated that at the above meeting, copies
of a letter to Madame Binh, head of the Vietcong delegation
to the Paris peace talks and the North Vietnamese in Paris,
were passed out, describing the purpose of the April 10 march.
This letter is set forth as follows:
"March 25, 1971
"Dear Mme. Binh,
"On April 10, many of us American women will be
marching on the Pentagon. You know already of the other
actions being planned here against the war. As women, we
are coming out from separate cities and roles, trying to
create reality out of what we once held looked up in our
imaginations. In marching on the Pentagon, we are joining with
all people inside and outside of Amerika, who fight against
Amerika's attempt to control us.
"We've been conditioned so long to accept Amerika's
definition of us as weak, passive, and powerless, and to deny
all our feelings of love and strength, that it has been a
struggle for us to turn towards each other and fight for our
freedom.
"Your own long struggle in Indochina, and the struggle
of Third World people here at home, awakened us to the
destruction that Amerikan power represents all over the world.
Your many victories against that power have been an inspiration
to us.
But it wasn't until we joined together to examine and
share our own experiences as women in Amerika that we saw

APPENDIX
STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY
"
Students for a Democratic Society, commonly
known as SDS, came into existence at a founding convention
held during June, 1962, at Port Huron, Michigan. From an
initial posture of "participatory democracy, Marxist-
Leninist ideology of various shadings became predominant
during 1968-1969 with debate centering on how best to create
a revolutionary youth movement. SDS moved from involvement
in the civil rights struggle to an anti-Vietnam war position
to advocacy of a militant anti-imperialist line linking up
the oppressed peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America
with the black liberation movement in the United States.
All major factions within SDS embrace Marxism-Lenism
and identify internationally with China, Cuba and North
Vietnam as countries leading the worldwide struggles
against the United States. However, the Soviet Union
was regarded as imperialist and with the Communist Party,
United States of America, "rvisionist" in nature.
SDS operated under a national constitution which
called for an annual Nationa Convention (NC) and quarterly
National Council meetings wherein programs were initiated
and debated. Three national officers were elected annually'
with a National Interim Committee to run the organization.
Regional offices and college chapters elected delegates to
the national meetings but each functioned independently on
local matters. Its official publication "Fire" (formerly
"New Left Notes") last appeared in December, 1969.
Internal factionalism of serious proportions
developed during 1968 - 1969 and the following three factions
evolved as a result of a split at the June, 1969, NC:
Weatherman, Worker Student Alliance (WSA), and Revolutionary
Youth Movement (RYM). The effect of the split on SDS chapters
throughout the country was divisive. Some aligned with one
or the other of the three major factions. Others, unable to
identify with any faction, disassociated with SDS completely
and changed names.
The SDS national office in recent years was
located at 1608 West Madison Street, Chicago, Illinois.

stated "we'll do another one.

The source stated that a committee was established
to work on advertising of the march and that Barbara Reilly,
among others, volunteered for this work. A second committee
was formed to plan the rallies in Washington, D.C. It was
stated there would be a brief rally at the Justice Department
and a major rally at the Pentagon. In addition, they would
arrange for the receipt of telegrams from the Toronto
conference, and Madame Binh, head of the Vietcong delegation
to the Paris peace talks and the North Vietnamese in Paris.
It was also stated that there would be guerrilla theaters and
a leaflet pointing out "targets" along Constitution Avenue.

Initially called the "Action Faction," Weatherman
came into being immediately before the June, 1969, Students
for a Democratic Society (SDS) National Convention (NC).
At this NC Weatherman won all three national officer positions
and a majority of the National Interim Committee as well.
Subsequently, they took over the SDS National Office (NO)
in Chicago, and controlled its funds, paper and national
records. Although internal struggle existed until late 1969,
Weatherman for all major purposes controlled SDS nationally
from June, 1969, until its NO closed in February, 1970.
this time it no longer considered itself part of SDS.
At
The term Weatherman emerged from an ideological
paper prepared by its leaders entitled "You Don't Need a
Weatherman to Know Which Way the Wind Blows" ("New Left
Notes" June 18, 1969). This statement outlined the basic
stance of Weatherman: Marxist-Leninist in content but with
strong advocacy that action not theory would bring about
revolution in the United States. This posture was complemented
with an international identification to the Cuban revolution
and CASTRO's statement that the duty of a revolutionary is
to make revolution.
During October, 1969, Weatherman riots in
Chicago resulted in more than 260 arrests for mob action
and related charges. A program of armed struggle was
finalized during a December, 1969, "War Council" wherein
terrorist tactics and political assassination were
contemplated. The basic strength of Weatherman was then
revealed to be some 300 - 350 nationally and geographically
apportioned to the Midwest, New York, and some Northwest.
-
As its rhetoric of violence escalated, Weatherman
leaders increasingly discussed the necessity of an underground
operation wherein more than 90 percent of the organization
would be submerged; "affinity groups" of three five members
would function independently. In February, 1970, Weatherman
leaders announced a program of "strategic sabotage" with
police and military installations as primary targets.
In February, 1970, Weatherman abandoned the
SDS NO, 1608 West Madison Street, Chicago, Illinois, and
throughout the country ertered an un ler round status.
A characterization of the SDS
is set out separately.

WORKER STUDENT ALLIANCE/
PROGRESSIVE LABOR PARTY
A source advised during August, 1969, that at
the National Convention (NC) of Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS) held in Chicago, Illinois, during June, 1969,
a split arose between the Progressive Labor Party (PLP) and
the National Office (NO), the NƆ) becoming known as the
Weatherman faction. The PLP faction drew the largest
support among those in attendance at the NC.
Source further advised that during late Summer,
1969, the PLP faction of SDS established its National
Headquarters (NH) on the second floor of a loft-type
building at 173A Massachusetts Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts.
The campaign on which the PLP faction centered was to build
a worker student alliance or a campus worker student
alliance. Thus, they adopted the names of Worker Student
Alliance (WSA) or Campus Worker Student Alliance.
Source stated that the "New Left Notes," printed
in New York City, is the official publication of the WSA
faction.
A second source advised during January, 1970,
that within the SDS, the WSA is a caucus of which the PLP
constitutes the leadership.
A third source advised during July, 1970, that
during demonstrations staged in the Boston area during the
Spring and Summer of 1970 by the NH, the main theme of
previous demonstrations staged by the NH shifted from
protestations of the Vietnam War and other United States
foreign policy matters to attacking domestic issues such
as racism and unemployment and demonstrating support of
the "workers' struggle.
Characterizations of the SDS
and PLP are set out separately.

REVOLUTIONARY YOUTH MOVEMENT
A source advised that the Revolutionary Youth
Movement II (RYMII) faction of Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS) held a national conference at Atlanta, Georgia,
from November 26 to 30, 1969. At this conference it was
decided to form a new organization to be known as Revolutionary
Youth Movement (RYM), characterized as a mass anti-imperialist
youth organization, said organization being proposed as
separate and distinct in form and content from SDS. The
"Principles of Unity" adopted by the conference included a
struggle against white supremacy and male supremacy; fights
against imperialism, anticommunism, fascism and oppression
of youth; and support of the right of self-determination of
all "oppressed nations," also support of the right of all
"oppressed and exploited" peoples "to armed self-defense.'
It was agreed that RYM would not be a Marxist-Leninist
organization; however, source said this was decided in order
to indicate an organization broad enough in form to be
acceptable to everyone. A temporary National Steering
Committee (NSC) made up of eight females and two males was
elected to govern RYM until national officers could be
elected during the Spring of 1970.
RYM publications have listed the RYM National Office
(NO) at Post Office Box 5421 and Post Office Box 77012 C,
both Atlanta, Georgia, and a second source has advised that
the NO has no office space but would probably be considered as
located at Apartment 27, 1067 Alta Avenue, Northeast, Atlanta.
Second source advised that women dominated the
founding conference and have continued to dominate NSC
meetings to the point that "women's liberation" has apparently
become the RYM's principal issue also that RYM's poor
financial condition has resulted in its failure to publish
a paper. During early 1970, RYM has decided to cater to
the working class rather than youth, since the potential for
social revolution lies in workers.
A third source has stated that it was decided at
the March, 1970, NSC meeting that RYM women had decided the
organization will be molded into a "working class, Marxist-
Leninist, revolutionary, anti-imperialist, problack
nationalist, people's women's liberation organization."

PROGRESSIVE LABOR PARTY
The "New York Times" city edition Tuesday,
April 20, 1965, Page 27, reported that a new party of
"revolutionary socialism" was formally founded on April 18,
1965, under the name of the Progressive Labor Party (PLP),
which had been known as the Progressive Labor Movement.
According to the article, "The Progressive Labor
Movement was founded in 1962, by MILTON ROSEN and MORTIMER
SCHEER after they were expelled from the Communist Party of
the United States for assertedly following the Chinese
Communist line."
A source advised on June 3, 1968, that the PLP
held its Second National Convention in New York City, May 31,
to June 2, 1968, at which time the PLP reasserted its
objective of the establishment of a militant working class
movement based on Marxism-Leninism.
L
The source also advised that at the Second National
Convention, MILTON ROSEN was unanimously re-elected National
Chairman of the PLP and LEVI LAUB, FRED JEROME, JARED ISRAEL,
WILLIAM EPTON, JACOB ROSEN, JEFFREY GORDON and WALTER LINDER
were elected as the National Committee to lead the PLP until
the next convention.
The PLP publishes "Progressive Labor," a bimonthly
magazine, and "Challenge-Desafio," a monthly newspaper,
Source advised on May 25, 1970, that the PLP
utilizes an address of General Post Office Box 808, Brooklyn,
New York, and also utilizes an office in Room 617, 1 Union
Square West, New York, New York.

According to information received from the Washington Field
Office and Domestic Intelligence Division, the 'April Tenth Women's Committee"
of New York City, a recently formed group of women's protest organizations,
plans a "March on the Pentagon" on Saturday, 4/10/71, as an anti-war protest.
Plans call for the protesters, who may number as many as 5,000, to assemble
at L'Enfant Square, Constitution Avenue, between Seventh and Ninth Streets,
Northwest, between 11:00 a. m. and noon, and thereafter march to the Pentagon
via Constitution Avenue and Memorial Bridge. The demonstration is scheduled
to end around 5:00 p.m. The Committee has reportedly chartered 14 busses
capable of carrying 630 passengers from New York City to Washington. The
busses are scheduled to unload at the Justice Building, where it is reported the
women will demonstrate. It is noted that L'Enfant Square, the assembly point
for the demonstrators, is within one block of the Justice Building. The protesters
are then scheduled to march to the Pentagon, where they will hold another
demonstration and will be picked up by the busses at the Pentagon.
General Services Administration (GSA) and Department security
officials are cognizant and plan to reinforce the guard force at the Tenth Street
Auto Entrance, which is the only Justice Building entrance open on Saturday.
Since we do not conduct tours on Saturday, no adjustment in our tours is neces-
sary.

WOMEN'S NATIONAL MARCH
ON THE PENTAGON
APRIL 10, 1971
CONFIDENTIAL
-On March 30, 1971, CV T-1, who has furnished

CV T-2, who has furnished reliable
information in the past, advised that on
September 9, 1970, that as of September,
1970, NANCY KURSHAN was one of five
"non-leaders" of the Youth International
Party (YIP) in New York City who actually
run the organization.
Source stated that KURSHAN has printed approximately
1,000 leaflets concerning the Women's March. It was learned
that the women from Ann Arbor did not care for the idea of
a Women's March on the Pentagon but the New York Women
overruled the objection since they appealed to the May Day
Coalition to do all the work such as obtain housing for the
people.
On March 31, 1971, CV T-1 advised that there would
be a meeting Thursday night, (April 1, 1971) in Kent, Ohio,
concerning the Women's March. This source stated that a
leaflet regarding the Women's March was discussed in
Kent, Ohio on March 31, 1971. Source also stated that it was
learned that the Women's group in Boston is planning to travel
by bus to Washington, D.C. on Friday (April 9, 1971), arriving
Saturday (April 10, 1971), and returning to Boston Saturday
night (April 10, 1971).

At noon January 15 on the Polk street steps of the San Francisco
City Hall ten thousand women in black who cannot go to Washington
will protest the war in Vietnam. In cities from New York to
Los Angeles women will gather to express their Christmas prayers
for peace.
Will you join us?
We will give to Mayor Joseph Alioto a copy of the Washington petition
and ask for his support. To so petition our government is a right
guaranteed by the First Amendment. We will telephone our Congressmen
from their offices in the Federal Building to let them know women will
be calling on them in Washington and that we join them in urging a
quick end to the Vietnam war.
Because we are for peace we will do these things peacefully with
respect for our fellowmen.

Contact has been maintained with all Seattle

1971, and no information has been developed to indicate
that captioned name is other than a temporary name used
on a "one-shot" basis for one demonstration observing
international women's day. Backers of the demonstration
were factional Trotskyist elements who are few in number
and poorly organized.
There is no indication captioned group is
a separate entity, organized for on-going action.

Women's Bail Fund
Unless otherwise stated, all sources in
this memorandum have furnished reliable
information in the past.
On March 30, 1971, a first confidential source
furnished literature, concerning the Women's Bail Fund, which
was picked up at the Upper Westside Womens Center, 627
Amsterdam Avenue, New York, New York (NY) on March 27, 1971.
The literature captioned, "Women's Bail Fund" argued that the
Women's House of Detention, in New York City (NYC), should
11
not exist and that "the Women's House of Detention, along with the
prisons and jails across the country, is a weapon used by the
power structure here in America to oppress and exploit the people
of poor communities.' It further relates that "Women have come
together in New York from many different organizations to form a
Women's Bail Fund for all the sisters inside the House of
Detention. The Bail Fund is also working to prepare simple
pamphlets on law because of the total lack of any legal
resources in the House of Detention and secure legal assistance
where needed." The address is listed as the Women's Bail Fund,
P.O. Box 637, Cooper Station, NY, NY 10003.
On August 26, 1971, the first source furnished
literature on the Women's Bail Fund which stated, "The Women's
Bail Fund is a coalition of Third World and white women who are:
...raising bail to release women prisoners from
Rikers Island.
11
establishing communication with women inside.
11 ..assisting women who are bailed out in meeting
their needs.

of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). It is the

....providing legal information for prisoners.
..making public the torture these women undergo.
...supporting prison struggles everywhere."
On April 12, 1971, a second confidential source
made available a flyer on the Women's Bail Fund which was
distributed at the National Womens March on the Pentagon on
April 10, 1971. The flyer, captioned, "Victory to the NLF and All
Oppressed Peoples" states "Women in Vietnam and in the United
States are fighting for the right to live: for the very right
to exist.....the U.S. is now dotted with concentration camps for
the poor and non-white: the jails.....But imprisonment doesnt'
break the spirit of the sisters in jail. They resist!
They resist! When denied
their dignity, they organize and fight back. When one sister is
beaten they organiz and resist. In the coldest part of winter
when the boilers had broken down, the women worked in freezing
temperatures in cold water to do the laundry-not 'because the
pigs made us do it but for our own beautiful sisters.' .....We
Vietnamese, Black, Latin, White and Asian-american women are
united in our struggle we share common goals and face a common
enemy. We express our complete solidarity with the NLF and shall
work to bring the victory there."

-p
On May 14, 1971, Special Agents (SAS) of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) observed a demonstration in front
of the NYC Women's House of Detention sponsored by the Women's
Bail Fund and Youth Against War and Fascism (YAWF). The
demonstrators chanted slogans calling for release of their
"sisters" from jail and expressed opposition to a proposed move
of the inmates of the Women's House of Detention from its
downtown site to the Rikers Island Prison Facility. The
demonstrators called this proposed move an attempt to isolate
the "sisters from their supporters.'
11
By means of a loudspeaker, the demonstrators called to
several inmates of the House of Detention who appeared in the
upper storey windows, obtained their names and place of arrest.
This information allegedly was to be used to obtain bail for the
prisoners in question. Thereafter, several speakers denounced
the jails as concentration camps and called for the release of the
"political prisoners." in the House of Detention. Among the
speakers was Shirley Taylor of the Women's Bail Fund and a
former inmate of the Women's House of Detention.

Women's Bail Fund
On January 6, 1972, the first source made available
a one page leaflet distributed through the mails by the Women's
Bail Fund and dated December, 1971. The leaflet is a request
for funds for the Bail Fund with the notation that donations
are tax exempt. The leaflet, in part says, "The Women's Bail
Fund is one arm of the growing nationwide prison solidarity
movement. During the past year we raised bail to release over
120 women who have been imprisoned while awaiting trial....."
On January 23, 1972, a seventh confidential source
advised that Post Office Box 637, Cooper Station, NY, NY,
is subscribed to by the Women's House of Detention Bail Fund
and rented by Mary C.X Pinotti, 86 East 3rd Street, NY, NY
(Telephone 777-5823.)'
FACT
The third source advised on February 10, 1972 the
Women's Bail Fund is trying to obtain a grant from the NY
People's Life Fund (PLF), however, they have been advised by
the PLF that they may receive a loan rather than an outright
grant. The source advised the Fund participated in a
demonstration a month ago at the New York City Correctional
Institution at Riker's Island, NY, however, said its activities
seem to be limited. The source advised that two principal
activists of the Women's Bail Fund are Amy Lowenstein and Gerry
✓ Tosca.
The NY PLF is a fund set up by the War Tax Resistance
(WTR) to grant loans or funds to local groups in
the NY area.
MEMBER OF SUEJEST ORGANIZATION
The WTR is a national organization which encourages.
the non-payment of federal taxes as a protest to
the war in Indochina.

YAWF is the youth group of the Workers World

WWP
:/
The WWP was founded in 1959 by individuals who
disagreed with policies of the Socialist Workers
Party (SWP). The WWP dissidents advocated
unconditional support of the Soviet Union and the
building of a revolutionary party geared to the
overthrow of capitalism. More recently the WWP
has called for peaceful solutions to Sino-Soviet
disputes, however, the WWP generally supports the
People's Republic of China in its ideological
differences with the Soviet Union.

Women's Bail Fund
A first confidential source advised that Beverly Sterner,
Channel 13 News, 304 West 58th Street, New York, New York,
is affiliated with the Women's Bail Fund (WBF).
An article appeared in the March, 1972 issue of
the "Liberated Guardian", captioned "Women's Bail Fund;
Organizing Our Anger", written by five unidentified members
of the Women's Bail Fund Collective.
The article relates "The Women's Bail Fund is a
group of about 35 women in New York City that bails women
out of jail (150 so far). They have been organized for over
a year and a half and did their first bailout on December 20,
1970. They have been active in supporting other groups
involved in the prison struggle. They do legal follow-up
for bailed-out sisters who want it and have been talking
with people about the prison struggle, why jails exist, who
the real enemies are, etcetera.'
statement:
"
The article is introduced by the following
"For this article we wanted to talk about ourselves.
So five of us volunteered to collect different thoughts from
as many women as possible in our group and then pooled these
reflections in this article, using the words from their raps."
The article, being reflections of the various
members of the group, is a series of quotes by unidentified
members concerning the WBF.

Women's Bail Fund
The following are reflections of some WBF
members carried under the subcaption "Our Roots - Why
We Started
Why We Joined".
-
"There was a woman in my consciousness-raising
group who was in the bail fund when it was first getting
started and she talked with others about it. To some of
us it was a very exciting idea. To others it was
frightening connecting to political activity as women.
Ultimately it ended in a split of my small group on
whether we should carry our newly raised consciousness
to any sort of feminist political action or not.
"In the past, I was politically frustrated because
I was only involved in one-shot actions. I saw what was
happening in terms of how this system functions to oppress
black people and that resulted in a lot of pain for me. .I
felt I had to reflect my stands in a day-to-day struggle.
I had the sense that the women in the WBF were also aware
of that need.
"When sisters want us to, we go to court with them.
When I go to court I find that it can do bad things to my
head. I make judgements like this jude is better than another
one, but it's all shit. All judges are pigs. Or like
feeling good that a sister got six months instead of five
years when she shouldn't have gotten anything at all.
"I was in the House of Detention when there was the
bail fund demonstration on December 20, 1970. The whole
tier was so excited. When someone saw the first people she
let out a scream and everyone rushed to the windows. As
the chanting increased outside we started to sing and chant.
They locked us in our cells so each person would be isolated
and intimidated about chanting. But all the women kept it
up. Everyone inside said the feeling about this demonstration
was different than other demonstrations. There had been more
contact. The women saw Afeņi and Joan and another woman
that they had known inside outside in the demonstration.
That was real important.
"A lot of it was the bail fund. The bail fund
banner with the address made it real that people were serious
about supporting people inside. It wasn't going to be a
one shot deal.

The following are reflections carried under the
sub-caption "Questions We Are Facing Right Now".
"There's a real dialectic between reform and
revolution. So much of what we do is short-term support
stuff that can be seen as reformist. When prisoners raise
these demands it's understood to be revolutionary; when
people on the outside raise them, they are felt to be
reformist. I have done a whole lot of courtroom work,
both in the bail fund and before too. In fact, the whole
social work thing is what I come out of, which is why it
is so hard for me to deal with all this ('cause I obviously
reflect a lot of that work). Social work when it started
back in the late 1800's and early 1900's came out of real
radical circles, the radicals and feminists and such. And
when you read MÃO, he talks about service to the people
as a revolutionary thing. But for us it feels weird
because it has been co-opted. I think that the movement
now, trying to recoup the revolutionary aspects, that
original sense of service to the people, trying to help
people survive.
"One of the ways to really keep ourselves.
out of the rut of being social workers is to engage in
more political education among ourselves and to ask other
groups how they've dealt with this question. Also we
should be more involved in educating other people.
We
"We should be doing more for women inside.
need to really work on facilitating communications
between the sisters inside the jail. Women prisoners
have been slower to get organized but I'm sure this is
because there is so much isolation in the women's jail.
Concretely, we need to write more letters to find out what
is going on, send literature, but also tell the women about
each other, about what other women are thinking and feeling.
This would stop the sense of isolation and increase the
sense of solidarity.
"I think much of the movement is guilty of
ultra-leftism. In China the Communists worked on a lot
of things that were a lot less than what they ultimately
wanted. We're too afraid of being contaminated by being
involved in reform movements. We too often define our
enemies too broadly and our allies too narrowly.

"I've been real impressed with what women in the
group are willing to commit themselves to do and that they
fulfill those commitments. And that atmosphere of res-
ponsibility affects new members too. This is real
important. It helps me through the rough times and all
the ideological hassles and struggles we go through.
You really have a sense that everyone really wants to work
things through, search for solutions, wants to hold
together because we feel responsible for the work. Even
the way people ask for leaves of absence when they are
sick or too busy, that they feel they want to explain
why they have to stop doing work for a while, shows
people's commitment and responsibility.

The "Liberated Guardian" was created in
April, 1970, through active and violent
dissent against the politics and policies
of the "Guardian". Its major aims were
to produce a "more revolutionary" paper,
to operate collectively within it and to
maintain by design a loose political position.
The "Guardian" is self-described as an
"independent radical newsweekly" which
takes a strong left position but is not
identified with any organized group. It
is considered to be the largest radical
weekly in America.
A second confidential source advised an account
for the WBF was opened on July 6, 1971, for $3,500. The
account was closed ten days later on July 16, 1971. This
account was opened by Patricia Reiner of 2451 Aldrich
Avenue South, Minneapolis. Reiner, on August 30, 1971,
submitted a forwarding address of 855 South Cedar Lane,
Valparaiso, Indiana 46383.
A third confidential source advised the WBF
set aside money for Constance Trimble at the First National
Bank, Minneapolis, Minnesota. The source advised two accounts
were opened for the WBF on behalf of Trimble. One account
was a savings account in the amount of $2,000%; the other
was a checking account in the amount of $2,800. The
trustees for these accounts were listed as Neil B. Dietrich
or Catherine Collins,

Chicago, Illinois, until February, 1970.
Internal factionalism during 1969 produced
three main factions: Weatherman, Revolutionary
Youth Movement (RYM), and Worker Student
Alliance (WSA). The Weatherman and RYM no
longer consider themselves associated with
the SDS. The WSA faction continues to use
the name SDS.
On April 14, 1972, a fifth confidential source
advised that Judith Clark was in touch on April 3, 1972,
with a Beth Last Name Unknown (LNU), at 466 East 48th
Street, Brooklyn, New York, concerning the WBF.
The source advised that Clark, on November 5,
1972, was in touch with an unknown female and discussed
the Wednesday night meeting of the WBF. Clark discussed
the fact that Jeannie LNU, Estelle LNU and Laurie LNU
would be at the meeting at 5:30 PM, that evening at Clark's
residence. The source related that Sara LNU and Naomi LNU,
both from the Defense Bail Fund, were also expected at
the meeting. Clark discussed the fact that the WBF
has no common politics and no common political direction
at this point and the WBF could become a defense committee,
not because it would be desireable, but because of a lack
of any other direction.
The source advised that on the same day, Clark
was in touch with Amy Lobenstine from the WBF at telephone
number 663-1136, and both agreed to attend an education
meeting of the Fund.
The fifth confidential source further related
that Clark was in contact, on April 8, 1972, with a
Marilyn Dalismer, 254-4498, and a Shelley Lawrence,
663-1136. Both were identified by the source as being
associated with the WBF.
On April 21, 1972, the fifth confidential source
advised Clark and Dohrn went to the residence of Marilyn
Dalsimer, 110 Bleecker Street, Apartment 7D, New York City,,
telephone number 254-4498 on that day. Dalsimer was
identified as a member of the WBF.

Constance Trimble was tried and found
not guilty on a charge of first degree
murder for making a telephone call
which lured a St. Paul, Minnesota
police officer to an ambush slaying
which occurred in 1970.
On April 5, 1972, and April 8, 1972, a fourth
confidential source advised Jennifer Dohrn and Judith
Clark were in contact with various members of the WBF
on these two days.
Judith Ann Clark is a member of the
->
Students for a Democratic Society (SDS)
Weatherman faction and was underground
in 1970 prior to her arrest on December 17,
1970 by Special Agents (SAS) of the FBI
New York City, as a result of an outstanding
arrest wanted for unlawful flight to avoid
prosecution - mob action. Clark was
indicted by a Federal Grand Jury at
Chicago, Illinois in April, 1970, prior
to her arrest. She was sentenced to
three years, for which she spent nine
months in the Cook County Jail, Chicago,
Illinois, and was released in July, 1971,
to serve the remaining time on probation
in New York City.
Jennifer Ellen Dohrn is the sister of
FBI Top Ten Fugitive Bernadine Rae Dohrn.
Both sisters are alleged members of
the SDS - Weatherman faction.
SDS was founded during June, 1962, at
Port Huron, Michigan, and in the 1960's
functioned as the leading New Left campus-
based student organization in the United
States. From a stance of "participatory
democracy," the SDS moved to a radical-
revolutionary position. It maintained a
national office at 1608 West Madison Street,

Re New York airtel and LHM, 8/28/72, and captioned
On 11/28/72, NY 7615-S advised the Women's Bail Fund
(WBF) is not a leading element and lacks any influence in the
movement in New York City.
A review of the subject file discloses there is no
structure to the WBF and that it is a coalition of women who
belong to various groups in the New York City area, whose main
purpose is to raise funds for selected women in jail.
It is noted that Weatherman subjects have contacted
those involved in the bail fund. However, have decryed the
lack of political direction of the WBF and would like to turn
it into a defense committee because of a lack of any other
direction. There is no indication that this has occurred, and
the bail fund still remains a loose coalition of like-minded
individuals from various groups seeking to raise funds for.
various purposes. Because of its lack of common political dir-
ection, it has had no influence and presently is ineffective in/
the movement.
In view of the above, the NYO is discontinuing investi-
gation in this matter to be reopened upon receipt of pertinent
information from sources that the bail fund is being redirected
as a structured group for a common political and ideological
purpose.

DEMONSTRATION PROTESTING U.S. POLICY IN VIETNAM,
WASHINGTON, D.C., JANUARY 15 - 16, 1968,
INFORMATION CONCERNING (INTERNAL SECURITY)
On January 3, 1968, Mrs. Nancy S. Pendergrast,
also known as Mrs. John Brittain Pendergrast, Jr., Atlanta
Coordinator for the Jeannette Rankin Brigade, furnished
the following information:
Women from all over the United States will meet
at the Union Depot, Washington, D.C., at 11:30 a.m., on
January 15, 1968, dressed in black, and will march silently
to the Capitol steps to present to Speaker of the House John
McCormack and Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield a peti-
tion to Congress demanding redress of grievances to end the
war in Vietnam. The group will hold a workshop on the evening
of January 15, 1968, and make plans for the next day's acti-
vities, such as lobbying of Congressmen on January 16, 1968,
and convening of a Congress of women. No civil disobedience
is anticipated.
Individuals from the Atlanta, Georgia, area who
are planning to join Jeannette Rankin in Washington are

Boston file 100-38735 entitled "EVAN PATCHEN
DELLINGER, aka PATCH DELLINGER; SM - ANARCHIST (BUFILE
100-450988)" reflected that DELLINGER was subject of
Boston investigation based on his participation in a
"Teach-In" and Rededication Service on 1/29/68 at the
Arlington St. Church, Boston. During the above activity,
DELLINGER made a statement in support of the "Resistance
Group" and turned in what was reported to be Selective
Service cards..
The primary function of the Resistance Group
was to aid, abet, and counsel young men faced with the
draft.
EVAN PATCHEN DELLINGER graduated from Swarthmore
College, Swarthmore, Pa., on 6/6/66 majoring in economics.
He was arrested at Chester, Pa. on 4/1/64 and was charged
with disorderly conduct.
The 1968-69 Harvard University Directory of
Officers and Students reflected that DELLINGER was enrolled
in the School of Medicine, Harvard University, Cambridge,
Mass.
It had been reported that PATCH DELLINGER was
present at a Socialist Workers Party (SWP) Street Meeting
in New York City on 7/21/64.
The file further disclosed that inasmuch as the
Boston office had no current information associating DELLIN-
GER with the SWP or the Young Socialist Alliance and that
his activities on behalf of the New England Resistance were
pacifist in nature, it was felt that DELLINGER did not
warrant inclusion on the Security or Agitator Indexes main-
tained at that time; and thus, the case was placed in a closed
status.

A review of Boston file 25-25585 (Bufile 25-569484)
reflected that DELLINGER was also subject of investigation
based on his participation in the previously mentioned
Rededication Services at the Arlington St. Church in Boston
on 1/29/68 at which 23 individuals turned in either a
Notice of Classification and/or a Registration Certificate.
Two other individuals turned in some other type of document.
It was determined that DELLINGER had turned in a Selective
Service Registration Certificate and two Notices of Classi-
fication issued by LB #28, Flemington, New Jersey. Also,
a two-page statement signed PATCHEN DELLINGER supporting
the Resistance movement was turned in.
In April, 1972, AUSA, Boston declined any prosecu-.
tion concerning DELLINGER.
On 8/21/72, personnel of the Office of the Mass.
Commissioner of Probation, Suffolk County Courthouse, Boston,
a central repository for all traffic and criminal conviction
records within the Commonwealth of Mass., advised that their
files contain no record identifiable with CHARLES WELCH,
WENDY SOBEL, or EVAN PATCHEN DELLINGER.
A review of the 1972 Police Listings for the
cities of Melrose and Boston revealed the following informa-
tion:

a remark that they were employed by a "research organization",
name unknown, and did most of their research at the Library
of Congress.
Mrs. JOHNSON stated that she has not been in the
dwelling at 219 11th Street, S.E., since it was rented to
these three girls. She has received no complaints concerning
any of their activities and she would have no personal know-
ledge of their activities.

On 9/14/72, WF 4805-PST furnished the August, 1972,

or anti-Government theme. All issues have been devoted to
articles pertaining to lesbian/feminist interests.
Investigation is continuing in an endeavor to
develop further background information regarding the "Furies"
newspaper and the individuals involved with this publication.
All receiving field offices are requested to complete
necessary investigation and expeditiously furnish results to

Re WFO report of SA JERRY M. GRAVES, 12/13/72, and
WFO letter to Bureau, 1/31/73.
On 3/6/73, WE 4027-S, advised that for all intents
and purposes the "Furies" organization and collective have
ceased to function. There are no plans to publish another
newspaper, and most of the members have left to pursue their
own interests.
As reported in re WFO report, investigation of this
case did not reflect any activities on the part of the "Furies"
thạt would be considered revolutionary or subversive.
The "Furies" newspaper ceased publication in August,
1972, and did not espouse a radical revolutionary line.
In view of the above, this case is being closed.
WFO will remain alert for information regarding any possible
future activity on the part of the "Furies", and will report
same at that time.

apparently four or five young white girls now live at
219 11th Street, S.E. Source has seen numerous different
girls frequenting the residence, but is unsure exactly
how many reside there at the present time.
One girl, name unknown, who resides at the residence,

seen several girls on different occasions carrying what
appeared to be newspapers. Source states that all the girls
are generally quiet and keep to themselves.
On September 13, 1972, WF T-5 advised that SUSAN
HATHAWAY, SUSAN SCHWING and COLETTA REID still rent and
apparently reside at 219 11th Street, S.E., Washington, D.C.
Source stated that these three girls continue to
pay their monthly rent promptly and she said that each
of the girls takes turns paying the rent each month.
Source related that when the dwelling was rented to
these three girls, they made a remark that they were employed
by a "research organization", name unknown, and did most of
their research at the Library of Congress.

articles pertaining to lesbian/feminist interests.
On October 12, 1972, WF T-9 advised that an internal
conflict has developed within the "Furies" collective and they
are breaking up into different factions, based on ideological
differents.

understanding that the National Lawyers Guild (NLG) was
formed around 1936 in New York City, and that the Chicago
Chapter of the NLG (CCNLG), which is affiliated with the

CONFERRITIAL
CHICAGO COUNCIL OF AMERICAN-SOVIET
RELATIONS, Formerly known as Chicago
Council of American-Soviet Friendship
EDWIN GORDON FOX, 7147 Jeffrey Avenue, Chicago,
Illinois, (now deceased) made available in January, 1954, the
"First Annual Report CCASF," an undated publication which
stated that the Chicago Council of American-Soviet Friendship
(CCASF) was incorporated in July, 1943. This document stated,
"The Council's affiliation with the National Council of
American-Soviet Friendship (NCASF) was validated August 11,
(1943). The present name was adopted to conform to standard
national practice. It should be noted, however, that the
Chicago Council is entirely autonomous; the government of its
affairs rests exclusively in the hands of its Chicago Executive
Board."
On April 8, 1965, a source furnished information to
the effect that as of March 11, 1965, this organization would
be known as the Chicago Council of American-Soviet Relations
(CCASR). MANDEL TERMAN continued to be listed as Chairman of
the new organization.
During April, 1965, a second source advised that
MANDEL TERMAN had arbitrarily dissolved the Board of Directors,
assumed all financial and other functions of the organization,
and was maintaining existing records of the organization at
his residence, 660 West Irving Park Road, Chicago, Illinois.
The aims and purposes of this organization continued to be
to work for peaceful coexistence and friendship with the USSR.
While it claimed to be an autonomous organization, its program
followed the NCASF and it was in frequent contact with the
NCASF.
'a
On November 5, 1958, a third source advised that in
the early 1940s, MANDEL TERMAN was a member-at-large of the
Communist Party (CP) of Illinois. TERMAN was in Russia in
November, 1958, where he had gone to discuss the treatment of
Jews and to discuss Jewish culture in the USSR with the
leadership of the Soviet Union.

CHICAGO COUNCIL OF AMERICAN-

CONFIDENTIAL
In January, 1966, a fourth source advised that the
ĊCASR went out of existence in the Spring of 1965 due to the
health condition of MANDEL A. TERMAN. The offices of the
CCASR, formerly located at 32 West Randolph Street, Chicago,
were for a short time carried at MANDEL TERMAN's home resi-
dence, 660 West Irving Park Road, Chicago. During the Fall
of 1965 due to the defunctness of the CCASR, the CP of Illinois
found it necessary to sponsor a rally honoring the 48th
anniversary of the Russian Revolution under a temporary
committee called "The Chicago Committee for American-Soviet
Friendship Rally." This rally was held on November 7, 1965,
and once the rally was held this temporary committee went
out of existence.
The fourth source advised that as of the present
time the CCASR is defunct in the Chicago area and any future
rally to be held on the American-Soviet friendship theme will
have to be organized by the CP of Illinois on a temporary
basis.
The NCASF has been designated pursuant to Executive
Order 10450.

The "Guide to Subversive Organizations and Publications"

Lawyers Guild:
"1. Cited as a Communist front.
(Special Committee on Un-American Activities,
House Report 1311 on the CIO Political Action
Committee, March 29, 1944, p. 149.)
"2. Cited as a Communist front which 'is the foremost legal
bulwark of the Communist Party, its front organizations,
and controlled unions' and which 'since its inception has
never failed to rally to the legal defense of the Communist
Party and individual members thereof, including known
espionage agents.'

September 21, 1950, originally related
September 17, 1950.)
"3. 'To defend the cases of Communist lawbreakers, fronts have
been devised making special appeals in behalf of civil
liberties and reaching out far beyond the confines of the
Communist Party itself. Among these organizations are the

itself is under fire these offer a bulwark of protection.'

TO ALL AMERICAN WOMEN,
November 27, 1967
I am proud of the fact that my first vote cast in Congress
was a vote against war. It was the first opportunity for a
woman to vote because I was the first woman to be elected
to Congress.
I believed then as I do today that women are the ones who
must be concerned with the needs and development of the
human race. I have always fought for the dignity of all
human beings for those of the present as well as those
of future generations.
--
I will continue to struggle as long as I live.
I hope all women will respond to the following CALL, and
join me in Washington on January 8, 1968, the opening
day of Congress.
With highest hopes,

A CALL TO AMERICAN WOMEN
who are outraged by the ruthless slaughter in Vietnam
and the persistent neglect of human needs at home
1
TO COME TO WASHINGTON JANUARY 15. & 16.
AMERICAN WOMEN constitute 51% of the voting population, yet a high percentage of us don't vote. ·
It is time for women to break out of their societal molds and take their place as effective, vocal citi-
zens. WOMEN CAN ELECT the President they want; Women can determine the political, social and
economic direction of the nation. WE HAVE WOMEN POWER. Let's use it to demonstrate our
opposition to this war to the Congress of the United States.
We are a broad coalition of women from many areas of American life. We shall meet in Washington
on January 15 for the opening of Congress to demand the following:
1.
2.
Nim
3.
4.
CONGRESS, AS ITS FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS, RESOLVE TO END THE
WAR IN VIETNAM AND IMMEDIATELY ARRANGE FOR THE WITHDRAWAL
OF ALL AMERICAN TROOPS.
CONGRESS USE ITS POWER TO HEAL A SICK SOCIETY AT HOME.
CONGRESS USE ITS POWER TO MAKE REPARATION FOR THE RAVAGED
LAND WE LEAVE BEHIND IN VIETNAM.
CONGRESS LISTEN TO WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE SAYING AND
REFUSE THE INSATIABLE DEMANDS OF THE MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL
COMPLEX.
After we petition the United States Congress, we will hold our own congress to articulate our position
on the basic problem of achieving peace. We declare our intention to return to our communities and
mobilize women to dedicate ourselves to reshaping American society, and restoring our country to a
position of honor in the community of nations.
On January 15, we will meet at the Union Depot in Washington, D.C., at 11:30 A.M., and walk behind
our delegation which will present our petition to the U.S. Congress.
On January 16, many of us will stay in Washington to begin implementation of these demands by
presenting them to our Congressmen and Senators. We hope you can stay.

Women's Bail Fund
The following are reflections of some WBF
members carried under the subcaption "Our Roots - Why
We Started Why We Joined".
-
"There was a woman in my consciousness-raising
group who was in the bail fund when it was first getting
started and she talked with others about it. To some of
us it was a very exciting idea. To others it was
frightening connecting to political activity as women.
Ultimately it ended in a split of my small group on
whether we should carry our newly raised consciousness
to any sort of feminist political action or not.
"In the past, I was politically frustrated because
I was only involved in one-shot actions. I saw what was
happening in terms of how this system functions to oppress
black people and that resulted in a lot of pain for me.
felt I had to reflect my stands in a day-to-day struggle.
I had the sense that the women in the WBF were also aware
of that need.
I
"When sisters want us to, we go to court with them.
When I go to court I find that it can do bad things to my
head. I make judgements like this jude is better than another
one, but it's all shit. All judges are pigs. Or like
feeling good that a sister got six months instead of five
years when she shouldn't have gotten anything at all.
"I was in the House of Detention when there was the
bail fund demonstration on December 20, 1970. The whole
tier was so excited. When someone saw the first people she
let out a scream and everyone rushed to the windows. As
the chanting increased outside we started to sing and chant.
They locked us in our cells so each person would be isolated
and intimidated about chanting. But all the women kept it
up. Everyone inside said the feeling about this demonstration
was different than other demonstrations. There had been more
contact. The women saw Afeņi and Joan and another woman
that they had known inside outside in the demonstration.
That was real important.
"A lot of it was the bail fund. The bail fund
banner with the address made it real that people were serious
about supporting people inside. It wasn't going to be a
one-shot deal.

Proposed Women's March, January 15, 1968,

Women's Bail Fund
The following are reflections carried under the
sub-caption "Questions We Are Facing Right Now".
"There's a real dialectic between reform and
revolution. So much of what we do is short-term support
stuff that can be seen as reformist. When prisoners raise
these demands it's understood to be revolutionary; when
people on the outside raise them, they are felt to be
And
reformist. I have done a whole lot of courtroom work,
both in the bail fund and before too. In fact, the whole
social work thing is what I come out of, which is why it
is so hard for me to deal with all this ('cause I obviously
reflect a lot of that work). Social work when it started
back in the late 1800's and early 1900's came out of real
radical circles, the radicals and feminists and such.
when you read MAO, he talks about service to the people
as a revolutionary thing. But for us it feels weird
because it has been co-opted. I think that the movement
now, trying to recoup the revolutionary aspects, that
original sense of service to the people, trying to help
people survive.
"One of the ways to really keep ourselves
out of the rut of being social workers is to engage in
more political education among ourselves and to ask other
groups how they've dealt with this question. Also we
should be more involved in educating other people.
"We should be doing more for women inside. We
need to really work on facilitating communications
between the sisters inside the jail. Women prisoners
have been slower to get organized but I'm sure this is
because there is so much isolation in the women's jail.
Concretely, we need to write more letters to find out what
is going on, send literature, but also tell the women about
each other, about what other women are thinking and feeling.
This would stop the sense of isolation and increase the
sense of solidarity.
"I think much of the movement is guilty of
ultra-leftism. In China the Communists worked on a lot
of things that were a lot less than what they ultimately
wanted. We're too afraid of being contaminated by being
involved in reform movements. We too often define our
enemies too broadly and our allies too narrowly.

WOMEN'S INTERNATIONAL LEAGUE FOR PEACE AND FREEDOM (WILPF)
In a leaflet dated January, 1962, WILPF described
itself as follows:
"What is the WILPF?
"It is the Women's International League for
Peace and Freedom, an international, inter-
racial organization striving for peace and
freedom by non-violent democratic methods.
It was founded in 1915, during the first
World War, and its first president was JANE
ADDAMS, the first American roman to win the
Nobel Peace Prize.
"How Does it Work?
"It keeps its membership informed on current
problems through its legislative office in
Washington. It issues its own pamphlets,
study kits, fact sheets, and cooperates with
like-minded organizations. WILPF has con-
sultative status at the United Nations on a
national and international level.
"What Does it Do?
"WILPF, through its local branches, sponsors
public discussion on such topics as disarma-
ment and world law, nuclear testing, civil
defense, Berlin, civil rights, etc. Through
its Peace Action Committee, WILPF initiates
peace walks, virils, and meetings, as an
organization and with other peace groups..
Peace education for children is a special
concern of WILPF.
"How Is it Set Up?
"The Women's International League for Peace and
Freedom has its national headquarters at JANE
ADDAMS House, 2006 Walnut Street, Philadelphia 3,
Pa., where its monthly Daner, FOUR LIGHTS, is
published. Its legislative office is at 120
Maryland Avenue, N.E., Washington 2, D. C.
International headquarters are in Geneva. The
International meets every three years. It
conducts summer schools, peace congresses and
publishes its magazine, PAX."

LA 4490 S has revealed in the past that members of both the
Women Strike for Peace (WSP) and the Women for Legislative
Action (WLA) were very active in the political campaigning
for her which resulted in her election.
The LAPD and the LACSO are cognizant of changes
in time schedule for local JRB action. Information copies
of this LHM are being furnished the U. S. Attorney and
Secret Service, Los Angeles; Region II, U. S. Army,
Pasadena; Office of Special Investigations, Norton Air
Force Base; Naval Investigative Service Office, San Diego,
California. Coverage is continuing.
Exact dates and locations of the subcommittee
meetings of the JRB have not been detailed in instant
LHM to further protect Source One, as some of these meet-
ings were attended by small numbers of persons which could
aid in pinpointing this valuable Security Informant.
The Bureau and Washington Field will be advised
promptly if the identities of any additional persons from
the Southern California area traveling to Washington, D. C.,
become known.

dated December 12 and 30, 1967, relating to a proposed march
on Washington, D. C., by the Jeannette Rankin Brigade (JRB),
when the United States Congress reconvenes in January 1968.

Source One advised that the Women Strike for Peace
see appendix) and the Women for Legislative Action
(WLA - see appendix) are the two major organizations in
Southern California working for the success of the January 15,
1968, activities of the JRB both locally and in Washington,
D. C. Subcommittees of the JRB have been meeting in the
headquarters of WSP at 5899 West Pico Boulevard, and WLA at
5889 West Pico Boulevard, Los Angeles. During the most
recent of these subcommittee meetings, held during the first
week in January 1968, at the latter location, much of the
discussion was related to proposed action in Southern California
by women who would be unable to travel to Washington, D. C.,
for the January 15th confrontation with Congress.
Minor changes in the previously announced schedule
of local activities for January 15, 1968, were agreed upon
at this meeting, as follows:
9:30 AM
Assemble on the front steps of the
Old California State Building,
First and Broadway, Los Angeles,
' where the JRB's list of grievances
will be read over a public address
system and then presented to California

According to the reports at this
JRB meeting, Mrs. Brathwaite, who
was not present, had agreed to

JRB women at the State Building,
or to send her personal representative

her to be present at that time.
Following a brief rally at the
State Building, the JR Brigaders
will enter the State Building with
leaflets%3B opening the doors of the
various offices, and handing leaf-
lets to any women in the building,
located at 217 West First Street.

this latter location. It is the
present intention of the JRB women
to go inside the administrative
buildings at the Board of Education
and leaflet women employees there.
At the most recent JRB subcommittee meeting,
Margaret Wright expressed her disappointment that no
organized civil disobedience was being planned for the
local action of the JRB. However, she added, "That's O.K.,
the police will force disobedience anyway!
The main slogan adopted by the local JRB is,
"The Hand that Rocks the Cradle is Going to Rock the Boat,
With Our Vote." Picket signs that have been approved to
be carried in the local JRB demonstrations include:
"You Can't Have War Without Women"
"Woman Power is Peace Power"
"Women Control the Vote"
It was announced that three different versions
"
of the local JRB "Call" would be distributed within the
next week. The three will be geered to Caucasians, Negroes,
and Mexican-Americans respectively. The monthly news bulletin
of the WSP, called, "La Wisp, for January 1968, has an appeal
to the WSP membership tojoin the local action if they are
-
-
unable to make the trip to Washington. It was also announced
that a $50.00 advertisement would be placed in the "Herald-
Dispatch," Los Angeles Negro newspaper, calling for the
support of members of the black-community. Three JRB
activists were to appear on local radio shows to plug the
JRB prior to January 15th.

Xerox copies of two documents being circulated
throughout Southern California during early January 1968,
to publicize the local and the national actions of the
JRB are appended to this memorandum. Leslie Parrish, who
is mentioned in one of these documents, according to Source
One, is a screen actress who has very recently become
interested and active in the anti-Viet Nam war movement

WOMEN FOR LEGISLATIVE ACTION
A source advised on May 1, 1963, that the Women
for Legislative Action was formed in 1952, claiming to be
an independent organization dedicated to non-partisan parti-
cipation in legislative and civic activities. Its position
in favoring or opposing legislation.usually parallels the
position of the Communist Party and related groups. It also
supports legislation to abolish the House Committee on Un-
American Activities. Membership in the Women for Legislative
Action does not, of itself, connote membership in or sympathy
with the Communist Party.
Another source advised on May 11, 1967, that the
Women for Legislative Action continues to be active in the
Los Angeles area.

COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF THE
WOMEN STRIKE FOR PEACE,
Also Known As
Women's International Strike for Peace
A source advised on May 14, 1967, that the Women
Strike for Peace (WSP) in the Southern California area began
its operations in the late fall of 1961, as an affiliate
of the national organization formed in Washington, D.C. It
is a peace oriented women's organization which is opposed
to the present American foreign policy in Vietnam. It has
also sought legislation which would bring about the abolition
of the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HCUA). In
recent months the organization has sponsored demonstrations
protesting the United States involvement in Vietnam and
calling for the complete withdrawal of all United States
troops from Vietnam. In the spring of 1966, it was instrumental
in originating and putting into effect a campaign advocating
support for "peace candidates" in the upcoming 1966 Congressional
elections.
The same source stated that WSP is a non-membership
organization and has no officers. The organization is open
to women of all political opinions who are interested in world
peace. It makes no effort to exclude from its activities
members of, or persons sympathetic to, the Communist Party.
and related groups.
The guiding force behind the Southern California
WSP groups is MARY CLARKE. A second source advised in July,
1955, that CLARKE was dropped from the Western Division, Los
Angeles County Communist Party (LACCP) in the Spring of 1955,.
for personal reasons and not because of any political differences
with the LACCP.-
The first source advised that Southern California
WSP maintains its office at 5899 West Pico Boulevard, Los
Angeles. It receives mail through Post Office Box 19739,
Los Angeles 19, California.

"I've been real impressed with what women in the
group are willing to commit themselves to do and that they
fulfill those commitments. And that atmosphere of res-
ponsibility affects new members too. This is real
important. It helps me through the rough times and all
the ideological hassles and struggles we go through.
You really have a sense that everyone really wants to work
things through, search for solutions, wants to hold
together because we feel responsible for the work.
the way people ask for leaves of absence when they are
sick or too busy, that they feel they want to explain
why they have to stop doing work for a while, shows
people's commitment and responsibility.
Even
The "Liberated Guardian" was created in
April, 1970, through active and violent
dissent against the politics and policies
of the "Guardian". Its major aims were
to produce a "more revolutionary" paper,
to operate collectively within it and to
maintain by design a loose political position.
The "Guardian" is self-described as an
"independent radical newsweekly" which
takes a strong left position but is not
identified with any organized group. It
is considered to be the largest radical
weekly in America.
A second confidential source advised an account
for the WBF was opened on July 6, 1971, for $3,500. The
account was closed ten days later on July 16, 1971. This
account was opened by Patricia Reiner of 2451 Aldrich
Avenue South, Minneapolis. Reiner, on August 30, 1971,
submitted a forwarding address of 855 South Cedar Lane,
Valparaiso, Indiana 46383.
A third confidential source advised the WBF*
set aside money for Constance (Trimble at the First National
Bank, Minneapolis, Minnesota. The source advised two accounts
were opened for the WBF on behalf of Trimble. One account
was a savings account in the amount of $2,000; the other
was a checking account in the amount of $2,800. The
trustees for these accounts were listed as Neil B. Dietrich
or Catherine Collins,

. Dear Friend:
1-
A number of our California women will join thousands
of others throughout the country in "ashington D. C. on
the opening day of Congress.. They are going to Congress
to: demand an end to the war, to help our sick society
at home and end the demands of the military.
This idea came about when an 86 year old former
Congresswoman, Jeanette Rankin, said: "If we had 10,000
women willing to go to prison if necessary, that would
end it. You cannot have wars without women."
We would like to raise enough money to send all who
wish to go. If you cannot join the group going to Wash-
ington, would you make a contribution so that those who can
go will not be handicapped by lack of funds.
Then, save a date on your new calendar. On Friday,
January 12th we will have a report on Washington given by
Leslie Parrish who will be one of the leaders of the So.
Calif. delegation. You will receive definite information
and confirmation by mail.
• If you are able to go to Washington%3B please call
761-1783 for further information.
Yours for Peace,
Valley Women Strike for Peace
P S. Please make your checks payable to Women Strike for
Peace and send it in the enclosed envelope. Thanks

Constance Trimble was tried and found
not guilty on a charge of first degree
murder for making a telephone call
which lured a St. Paul, Minnesota
police officer to an ambush slaying
which occurred in 1970.
71
On April 5, 1972, and April 8, 1972, a fourth
confidential source advised Jennifer Dohrn and Judith
Clark were in contact with various members of the WBF
on these two days.
Judith Ann Clark is a member of the
Students for a Democratic Society (SDS)
Weatherman faction and was underground
in 1970 prior to her arrest on December 17,
1970 by Special Agents (SAS) of the FBI
New York City, as a result of an outstanding
arrest wanted for unlawful flight to avoid
prosecution - mob action. Clark was
indicted by a Federal Grand Jury at
Chicago, Illinois in April, 1970, prior
to her arrest. She was sentenced to
three years, for which she spent nine
months in the Cook County Jail, Chicago,
Illinois, and was released in July, 1971,
to serve the remaining time on probation
in New York City.
Jennifer Ellen Dohrn is the sister of
FBI Top Ten Fugitive Bernadine Rae Dohrn.
Both sisters are alleged members of
the SDS - Weatherman faction.
SDS was founded during June, 1962, at
Port Huron, Michigan, and in the 1960's
functioned as the leading New Left campus-
based student organization in the United
States. From a stance of "participatory
democracy," the SDS moved to a radical-
revolutionary position. It maintained a
national office at 1608 West Madison Street,

that the Jeannette Rankin Brigade (JRB) planned on a
demonstration in Washington, D.C. on January 15, 1968, the

the source, officials of the JRB want to assemble on the
steps of the United States Capitol and present a petition
to officials of the United States Congress but the United
States Capitol Police has refused to grant them permission
for such an assembly. The source further stated that
attorneys for the JRB have petitioned the United States
District Court to grant an injunction prohibiting the
enforcement by the United States Capitol Police of a
Congressional ruling prohibiting demonstrations on the
United States Capitol grounds.
The above source stated that plans for the
demonstration still consist of assembling at Union Station
at 12:30 p.m. January 15, 1968, marching to the Capitol
where they will present a petition to Congressional
officials and also confer with various Congressmen and

On April 14, 1972, a fifth confidential source
advised that Judith Clark was in touch on April 3, 1972,
with a Beth Last Name Unknown (LNU), at 466° East 48th
Street, Brooklyn, New York, concerning the WBF.
The source advised that Clark, on November 5,
1972, was in touch with an unknown female and discussed
the Wednesday night meeting of the WBF. Clark discussed
the fact that Jeannie LNU, Estelle LNU and Laurie LNU
would be at the meeting at 5:30 PM, that evening at Clark's
residence. The source related that Sara LNU and Naomi LNU,
both from the Defense Bail Fund, were also expected at
the meeting. Clark discussed the fact that the WBF
has no common politics and no common political direction
at this point and the WBF could become a defense committee,
not because it would be desireable, but because of a lack
of any other direction.
The source advised that on the same day, Clark
was in touch with AmyX Lobenstine from the WBF at telephone
number 663-1136, and both agreed to attend an education
meeting of the Fund.
The fifth confidential source further related
that Clark was in contact, on April 8, 1972, with a
Marilyn Dalismer, 254-4498, and a Shelley Lawrence,
663-1136. Both were identified by the source as being
associated with the WBF.
On April 21, 1972, the fifth confidential source
advised Clark and Dohrn went to the residence of Marilyn
Dalsimer, 110 Bleecker Street, Apartment 7D, New York City,
telephone number 254-4498 on that day. Dalsimer was
identified as a member of the WBF.

HELENA, MONTANA
TO ALL AMERICAN WOMEN,
November 27, 1967
I am proud of the fact that my first vote cast in Congress
was a vote against war. It was the first opportunity for a
woman to vote because I was the first woman to be elected
to Congress.
I believed then as I do today that women are the ones who
must be concerned with the needs and development of the
human race. I have always fought for the dignity of all
human beings for those of the present as well as those
of future generations.
I will continue to struggle as long as I live.
I hope all women will respond to the following CALL, and
join me in Washington on January 8, 1968, the opening
day of Congress.
With highest hopes,

to join former Congresswoman Jeannette Rankin and thousands of women from all
areas of our nation in demanding that Congress, as it's first order of business
RESOLVE: to END THE WAR in Vietnam, and arrange for the orderly withdrawal
of all American troops:
►to use its power and the billions now wasted on war, to solve some
of the problems of our crisis-ridden society by seriously working for
better and low-cost housing, more day-care centers, more jobs and
job-training, eliminating poverty and discrimination, and conducting
a massive campaign against racism and bigotry in our s chools,
governmental agencies, or wherever it appears.
COME TO WASHINGTON, D.C. JANUARY 15th
to represent the Pacific Northwest at the
JEANNETTE RANKIN
NATIONAL CONGRESS OF WOMEN
at which we can discuss our many problems and suggest solutions.
Women constitute 51% of the American electorate. 1968 is an election year. If
we devote ourselves wholeheartedly to it, we can force the administration to
End the War, and to change our foreign policies; to restore our nation to a
position of honor in the community of nations; to reshape American society
to meet the needs of the people, and plan for a better tomorrow for all Americans.

memorandum is attached for ready reference.
It has been previously reported that the Jeannette
Rankin Brigade, a nationwide group of women opposed to the
war in Vietnam, will sponsor a demonstration in Washington, D.C
on January 15, 1968, to petition Congress to end the war in
Vietnam.
Current plans of the Brigade call for the demon-
stration to assemble at Union Station, Washington, D. C.,
at 12:30 p.m. and march to the Capitol via Louisiana Avenue.
The Brigade has been unable to obtain a permit to assemble
at the Capitol as previously planned.

Their request to meet with Speaker of the House,
John W. McCormack and Senator Michael J. Mansfield on the
steps of the Capitol for the purpose of presenting their
petition before the entire demonstration has been thwarted.
Speaker McCormack agreed to meet with a delegation of 10 to
15 women in his office. Following the presentation of the
petition and until 2 p.m., participants will confer with various
Congressmen. At 2 p.m., they will be taken by bus to the
·Shoreham Hotel, Washington, D. C., for a conference from 2 to
6 p.m.
At 6 p.m., those returning to the New York-Philadelphia ‹
area will be transported by bus to Union Station to entrain.

..
It was previously reported that the Jeannette
Rankin Brigade, a nationwide group of women who are opposed
to the war in Vietnam, will sponsor a demonstration in
Washington, D. C., on January 15, 1968, to petition Congress
to end the war in Vietnam.
:
Sources who have furnished reliable information 'in
the past have advised that current plans call for the Brigade
to assemble at Union Station, Washington, D. C., at 12:30 p.m.,
January 15, 1968. The demonstrators will march to the Capitol
via Louisiana Avenue. The Brigade's plans originally called
for the demonstrators to assemble at the Capitol; however,
legal restrictions have arisen to prevent the demonstrators
from assembling at this site.
The Brigade further had hoped to present their
petition to Speaker of the House. John W. McCormack, and
Senator Michael J. Mansfield on the steps of the Capitol.
Speaker EcCormack has answered their request by stating that
he could not meet them on the steps, but would be willing to
receive a delegation of ten to fifteen women in his office
on that date. Following this, some participants will confer
with various Congressmen.
At 2 p.m. on January 15, 1968, the demonstrators
plan to be taken in busses to the Shoreham Hotel, Calvert
Street, Northwest, Washington, D. C., where the Brigade has
reserved a banquet room from 2 to 6 p.m. At 6 p.m., those
attending the meeting at the Shoreham Hotel will again be
transported by bus to Union Station where those who arrived
by train will depart to the New York-Philadelphia area by
special train departing at 7:10 p.m.
L
Some of the Brigade's demonstrators are expected to
remain in Washington, D. C., until January 16, 1968, at which
time they will attempt to confer with their Congressmen
concerning the war in Vietnam.

REVACT
(00: NY)
DATE:
11/30/72
Re New York airtel and LHM, 8/28/72, and captioned
On 11/28/72, INFORMANT advised the Women's Bail Fund
(WBF) is not a leading element and lacks any influence in the
movement in New York City.
A review of the subject file discloses there is no
structure to the WBF and that it is a coalition of women who
belong to various groups in the New York City area, whose main
purpose is to raise funds for selected women in jail.
It is noted that Weatherman subjects have contacted
those involved in the bail fund. However, have decryed the
lack of political direction of the WBF and would like to turn
it into a defense committee because of a lack of any other
direction. There is no indication, that this has occurred, and
the bail fund still remains a loose coalition of like-minded
individuals from various groups seeking to raise funds for
various purposes. Because of its lack of common political dir-
ection, it has had no influence and presently is ineffective in
the movement.
In view of the above, the NYO is discontinuing investi-
gation in this matter to be reopened upon receipt of pertinent.
information from sources that the bail fund is being redirected
as a structured group for a common political and ideological
purpose.

Dear WSPER:
Women Strike for Peace nationally is supporting the Jeannette Rankin Brigade.
Planeloads, trainloads and carloads of women will be coming into Washington on Mon-
day, January 15th, from all over the country.
We are particularly pleased with this action because it represents for the first
time a real coalition of women's peace groups, church groups, theatre personalities,
and community leaders.
The Day is envisioned as a solemn, dignified confrontation of those who should be
representing the ever growing opposition to the war. We ask that you write your Con-
gressmen urging that they support the four points listed in the enclosed Call as Con-
gress reconvenes. Later in the afternoon at our Women's Congress we want to be able to
report on Congressional responses.
We will all meet at Union Station in Washington at 11:30 AM and slowly walk to the
Capitol. We ask the women to wear black. We will be led by Jeannette Rankin who will
proceed to the top of the Capitol steps with a representative delegation of 50 women to
present our petition to the two men who represent the whole of Congress, Senator Mike
Kansfield and Speaker of the House McCormack. The delegation will read the demands be-
fore the assembled women and the two Congressmen. Leaving the Hill, the women will enter
buses for a motorcade to a Congress of American Women (place to be announced).. Women
will present an analysis of the current crisis on the war front and the domestic front,
Leading to suggestions for program and actions to be taken back to our communities for im-
lementation.
:
Women may choose to remain in Washington the next day to meet with their Congressmen.
f you wish to stay and wish help in securing accommodations, contact the Hospitality Com-
littee, 2140 P. St. N.W. Washington, DC (293-2020). We regret that in order to get the
owest train fare we had to guarantee return the same day; therefore you would have to
inance your own trip back on the 16th.
Our hope is that 10,000 women will converge upon Washington. We urge you to parti-
ipate.
Yours for Peace,
Ethel Taylor

JEANNETTE RANKEN BRIGADE
-
Information was developed that in late fall of 1967
an organization known as the Jeannette Ranken Brigade had sent
out a call for a demonstration to be held at the White House in
Washington, D. C., on January 8, 1968, in protest of the War in
Vietnam. Jeannette Ranken, the Chairman of this Brigade, is
86 years old and is a former member of Congress from the State
of Montana, She first went to Congress in 1917.
The December 14, 1967 issue of the "St. Louis Post-
Dispatch", a daily St. Louis newspaper, in an article on
Page 10C, stated that Jeannette Ranken was planning a massive
Vietnam peace project by women who would converge on Congress
in January, 1968. She is elsewhere quoted to have said, "Tex
thousand women have sat back and let their sons be killed in
Vietnam. If we had ten thousand women willing to go to jail
if necessary we could stop the war in Vietnam. You canrot bay
wars without women. She has stated that she is willing to
stay in jail until the bombing in Vietnam is stopped.
"
Source One advised on January 6, 1968, that the
St. Louis Peace Information Center, at 6217 Delmar, has been
active in organizing interest in the Jeannette Ranken demonstatio
It was announced that the date for the demonstration at Washington.

that the demonstration would take place at the St. Louis County,
Missouri Courthouse at Clayton, Missouri. It will consist of
women dressed in black, standing in silence for one hour beren

Democrat", a St. Louis daily newspaper, Friday, January 12, 1968
states that vigil for peace will be held at Clayton. This
article says that an hour-long vigil for peace by women wearing
black is planned for January 15, 1968, for one hour at noon at
the St. Louis County Courthouse. The vigil is being carried
out by the St. Louis Chapter of the Women Strike for Peace,

Chapter. She is further referred to as the wife of the Clayton,
Missouri, businessman who is a member of the Veterans for Peace.
According to the article, plans will be finalized at a meeting
to be held at the Peace Information Center on January 13, 1968.
Source Two advised on January 10, 1968, that women
from St. Louis who intend to take part in the January 15, 1968,
demonstratior at Washington, D. C., are being told that the
St. Louis group will travel together via Trans World Airlines.
They will depart St. Louis at 6:25 PM on Sunday, January 14

Today, January 15,
Congress
reconvenes in Washington.
Women from all over the United
States have gathered there to
petition the Congress in the
name of the Jeanette Rankin
Brigade. Jeannette Rankin,
the first woman to serve in
Congress and the only person
to vote against U.S. entry
into both World Wars, leads
the women there, along with
such other sponsors as Mrs.
M.L.King, Mrs. Harry Belafonte,
Mrs. John C. Bennett, Mrs.
Benjamin Spock, Mrs Judith
Morse Eaton. The Brigade is a
national coalitie of women
antiwar groups mobilized
against the war in Veitham.
As the cost of the war in lives
and money mounts daily, the
women of this country call upon
congress to take action against
it. To support the senators and
Congressmen who oppose the war,
to encourage those who are troubled
but silent, to speak out, and to
make our position known to those
who still support this immoral
war, we, as women of Hawaii, are
gathered here. Our message to
Reps. Mink and Matsunaga, to
Sens. Fong and Inouye, is that
women will no longer give their sons and loved ones to a government
waging a genocidal war...
women will no longer accept a government which represents a military
and industrial machine rather than its people...
women will no longer consent to raise their children in the blight
and neglect of a society geared to profit and war...
women grieve for suffering people all over the world and will no longer
remain silent while the gap widens between the rich and the poor...
We ask our government to design and carry out a domestic program
commensurate with the needs of the American people; to follow a
policy of non-intervention in the affairs of other countries; to
pursue our official committment to disarmament, and to respect
international law.
American women who, as women everywhere, are the bearers and conservers
of life, will not stand idly by as life is destroyed, in our name.
About two hundred Oahu women have signed the following petition to
Congress:
As Congress reconvenes, we urge that its first order of business
be to put an end to the war in Vietnam and arrange for the withdrawal
of American troops; and that the Congress turn its attention to
ameliorating the crisis in America.
We urge the Congress to heal a sick society at home, to make reparations
for the ravaged land we leave behind in Vietnam and to refuse to
listen to the insatiable demands of the military-industrial complex.
I want to be kept informed about women's peace activities.

leaders. Officials refused to allow the women to assemble
as it is in violation of a United States law prohibiting
demonstrations on the United States Capitol grounds. The
source advised on January 12, 1968, that a final meeting
with the United States Capitol Police officials had been
held and it had been decided by the representatives of
the JRB that the women would assemble at Union Station
at approximately 11:30 a.m. and march to Union Square
located at the foot of Capitol Hill off the Capitol
grounds. Officials of the JRB obtained a permit from the
United States Park Police granting them permission to use
an area in the vicinity of Union Square for assembling and
hearing the reading of the petition which was to be;
presented to the United States Congress by a small..
delegation of that organization.
AD
The source advised on January 12, 1968, that
the JRB had rented the Regency Ballroom of the Shoreham
Hotel, Calvert Street, N.W., Washington, D.C., from 2 to .
6 p.m. on January 15, 1968. After meeting on Union
Square, the group will travel by bus to the Shoreham
Hotel where they will hold a Congress of American Women.
After 6 p.m. they will be bused to Union Station where they
will depart Washington, D.C.
b
Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investi-
gation on January 15, 1968, at approximately 11:30 a.m.
observed several hundred people assembled in Union Station
apparently waiting to participate in the JRB demonstration
at that time. At approximately 11:40 a.m. a train bound
from New York City to Washington, D.C., arrived at Union
Station with approximately 1,500 individuals, mostly women,
aboard. These individuals began marching at twelve noon
away from Union Station, South on Louisiana Avenue. Now
numbering approximately 2,600, they marched six abreast
on the West sidewalk of Louisiana Avenue to the vicinity
of Union Square where they began arriving at approximately
12:35 p.m.

DEMONSTRATION PROTESTING
UNITED STATES POLICY IN VIETNAM
WASHINGTON, D.C.
JANUARY 15, 1968
A confidential source, who has furnished reliable
information in the past, advised in December 1967, that
the Jeannette Rankin Brigade (JRB) had been formed primarily
by members of Women Strike for Peace, a pacifist organization.
Members of Women Strike for Peace had formed the organization
following a statement made by former Congresswoman Jeannette
Rankin of Montana, in which she stated that if 10,000 American
housewives were willing to be arrested, they could stop
the war in Vietnam. According to the source, the JRB was
formed as a "one shot organization" to sponsor a demonstration
in Washington, D.C., when Congress reconvenes in 1968.
The same source advised that January 15, 1968,
had been established as the date of the above demonstration
in view of the fact that Congress was reconvening on that
date. The source stated that the headquarters of the JRB
was located in New York City and that officials there and
in other large United States cities including Los Angeles,
San Francisco and Washington, D.C., were formulating the
plans for a "march on the United States Capitol" where
the women would present to the United States Congress a
petition demanding that the Congressmen end the war in
Vietnam. The source stated that a small minority in the
above organization were in favor of commiting acts of civil
disobedience and being arrested but the vast majority of
the organization wanted a peaceful demonstration to again
focus the Congressional attention upon the war in Vietnam.
The same source advised in January, 1968, that
representatives of the JRB met with officials of the United
States Capitol Police on several occasions and attempted
to gain permission to assemble on the steps of the United
States Capitol and present a petition to Congressional

Most of the participants in the above march were
female and dressed in black with some wearing black wreaths.
The monitors and spokesmen for the group instructed them
not to talk to each other but to march in a silent, solemn
procession.
A second source, who has furnished
reliable information in the past,
advised on June 30, 1966, that
}a
Amy Swerdlow, also known as Mrs. Stanley
Swerdlow, was listed as a "non-party..
visitor" at the 18th Nation Convention
CP, USA, held in 1966 in New York City.
Captain Robert Krahling, United States Capitol
Police, Washington, D.C., advised on January 15, 1968,
that Jeannette Rankin and approximately fifteen members
of the JRB visited the office of Speaker of the United
States House of Representatives John McCormick at
approximately 1 p.m. this date. He stated they presented
him with a copy of a petition which was entitled "A
Petition to the 90th Congress" and which stated the
following:
"We Women of the United States, who are
•
outraged by the ruthless slaughter in Vietnam and
the persistent neglect of human needs at home,
have come to Washington to petition the Congress
of the United States for the redress of intolerable
grievance and demand that:
1.
Congress shall, as the first order of business,
resolve to end the war in Vietnam and immedi-
ately withdraw all American troops.
Congress shall use its power to heal a sick
society at home
2.
Congress shall use its power to make reparations.

to leaving Union Station, many small placards were observed,
some of which read: "End the War" and "LBJ Eats Imperial
Margarine." These placards were removed from the demonstration
when the participants were advised they would only be
allowed to carry a large banner in front and a large banner
in the rear of the marchers. The banner bringing up the
rear of the marchers read as follows: "U.S. Women Unite
End the War in Vietnam." Before the participants began
marching, one Amy Swerdlow of New York City, acting as
spokesman for the group, stated that a delegation of
fifteen women were going by car to present their petition
to the United States Congress while the rest of them
would walk to Union Square where the petition will be
read to them by Viveca Lindfors. After the reading of
this petition, the participants were instructed to board
buses which were located near Union Square and they would
be transported to the Shoreham Hotel..
All of the participants had arrived at Union
Square by: approximately 1 p.m. and it was estimated by
police officials that approximately 2,600 individuals had
taken part in the march. Small placards had been observed
in Union Station which showed representatives there from

Just prior to the opening of the above program,
a group entitled "Radical Women's Group from New York"
put on a skit which included the bringing in of a stretcher
indicating that it was the body of a dead soldier. On
the stretcher was a telegram of regrets and it was stated
that there would later be a mock burial of the above
"corpse."
The program of the Congress of American Women
began with Pearl Willen of New York acting as the presiding
officer. She made announcements to the effect that there
was much literature on the tables and that workshops would
be held both tonight and the following day. She welcomed
representatives from forty states to the gathering and
stated that they now need to go from the great society
to the just society. Mrs. Willen introduced the two
Co-Chairmen of the Congress as Mrs. Coretta King of
Georgia and Mrs. Mary Clark of Los Angeles, California,
who were both present and acknowledged the introduction.

The first speaker on the program was Mrs. Vivian
Hallinan of San Francisco, California, who described the
development of the coalition of women which had developed
into the JRB. She said the JRB had been conceived in
California last year after the statement by Mrs. Rankin
concerning what the women could do to stop the war.
Hallinan described the JRB's goal as "world without war"
and "life with dignity and opportunities to develop our
maximum capacity."
The next speaker on the program was Mrs. Martin
Luther King, Jr., who was initially introduced as Coretta
King. Mrs. King stated that she was greatly encouraged by
the growth of the peace movement and that she was totally
opposed to the brutal slaughter in Vietnam. She stated that
the women must use all of their power to stop that war.

She stated that the men had gotten us into this war and
had made a complete mess of it. She stated that there is
a need to end the war so that we may tend to the needs of
people in urban ghetto areas. Injustice in our society
must be taken care of and she described the present

I
It was previously reported that the Jeannette
Rankin Brigade, a nationwide group of women who are opposed
to the war in Vietnam, would sponsor a demonstration in
Washington, D. C., on January 15, 1968, to petition Congress
to end the war in Vietnam.
At 11:40 a.m., January 15, 1968, a group,
predominantly women numbering approximately 2,600, assembled
at Union Station, Washington, D. C., and marched six abreast
on the west sidewalk of Louisiana Avenue to Union Square at
the foot of Capitol Hill.
87
The marchers were preceded by several individuals
carrying a large banner which read, "End the War in Vietnam
and Social Crisis at Rome. Several women followed the
narchers carrying another banner which read, "United States
Women Unite, End the War in Vietnam. Prior to leaving
Union Station, participants carried several other small
placards some of which read, "End the War" and "LBJ Eats
Imperial Margarine." At the request of authorities, the
demonstrators discarded these placards.
Before the demonstrators left Union Station, a
delegation of 15 women, including Jeannette Rankin, drove
to the Capitol where they presented a petition to Represen-
tative John W. McCormack, Speaker of the House of Represen-
tatives, and to Senator Michael J. Hansfield. This petition
was entitled "A Petition to the 90th Congress" and stated

Vincent Hallinan was candidate for President
of the United States on the Independent Progressive Party
ticket in 1952. This party was formed in California in 1948
and ceased to exist in 1954, when it failed to poll sufficient
votes to remain on a California ballot. The California
Senate Fact-Finding Committee on Un-American Activities in
its 1955 report on page forty-six, states in part that the
Independent Progressive Party in California was quickly
captured by the communists and soon was being operated lock,
stock and barrel by the Communist Party of California.
A source advised on April 20, 1966, that Vincent
Hallinan was the Treasurer for American Institute For Marxist
Studies (AIMS).
A characterization of AIMS
is contained in the appendix.

According to the source, it is the aim and
objective of Vivian Hallinan when she goes to Washington,
D.C., in conjunction with the Rankin Brigade to get herself

INFORMATION CONCERNING
(INTERNAL SECURITY)
2.0
M
Information has previously been disseminated
to the White House and other interested agencies concerning
the plans of captioned organization, a nationwide group of
women who are opposed to the war in Vietnam, to stage a
demonstration in Washington, D.C. on 1/15/68 and present a
petition to Congress demanding an end to the Vietnam war.
This demonstration was held as scheduled on 1/15/68.
The demonstrators marched from Union Station to
Union Square at the foot of Capitol Hill by way of Louisiana
Avenue. The group was preceded by several individuals
carrying a banner which read "End the War in Vietnam and Social
Crisis at Home." Several women followed the marchers
carrying another banner which read "United States Women
Unite, End the War in Vietnam." Initially, the group carried
other placards which read "End the War" and "LBJ Eats
Imperial Margarine." However, at the request of authorities,
these placards were discarded.
The
Before the demonstrators left Union Station, a
delegation of 15 women, including Jeannette Rankin, drove
to the Capitol where they presented a petition to
Representative John W. McCormack, Speaker of the House of
Representatives, and to Senator Michael J. Mansfield,
petition entitled "A Petition to the 90th Congress" pointed
out the opposition of women of the United States to the
ruthless slaughter in Vietnam and the persistant neglect to
human needs at home and demanded Congress as the first order
of business resolve to end the war in Vietnam and immediately
withdraw all American troops. It called for Congress to use its
power to help a sick society at home, to make reparations for
destruction in Vietnam and to listen to what the American people
are saying and refuse the insatiable demands of the military
industrial complex.

Memorandum to Mr. W.C. Sullivan
RE: JEANNETTE RANKIN BRIGADE
This petition was read to the demonstrators
assembled at Union Square by Swedish film actress, Viveca
Lindfors.
Following the assembly at Union Square, the marchers
were bussed to the Shoreham Hotel where they convened a
congress of American women from approximately 2:30 p.m. to
5:40 p.m.
During this time, speeches were made by Vivian
Hallinan, who has been described by her son, Terrence
Hallinan, as being willing to join the Communist Party if her
husband would join. Hallinan described the Brigade's goal as
"world without war" and "life with dignity and opportunities
to develop our maximum capacity."
Mrs. Martin Luther King, Jr., stated that women must
use all of their power to stop the war in Vietnam. She
described present challenges as "militarism, racialism and
wantonism.
Jeannette Rankin welcomed the participants and stated
women must see that the military system is destroyed. She
recommended that women everywhere become candidates for political
offices. Mrs. Dagmar Wilson, Chairman of the Women Strike for
Peace, a national pacifist group, spoke concerning United States
policy in Vietnam. She stressed the need for education in order
to change United States policy and stated that their demonstra-
tion was the beginning of a revolution.
While this assembly was taking place a small group
calling themselves Radical Womens Group met in a room across the
hall. This group was very disorganized and was held without
apparent objective.
Sympathy demonstration were held in Miami, Florida;
Boston, Massachusetts%3B Seattle, Washington%3B St. Louis, Missouri;B
Portland, Oregon; Atlanta, Georgia%; San Francisco and Los Angeles,
California. In San Francisco the Brigade's contingent
presented a petition to the Mayor who agreed to transmit it to
Washington. In Los Angeles, the contingent attempted to speak
before the City Council, but their request was denied.

APPENDIX
"The Jewish Fraternalist" dated October, 1947, self-
identified as the official publication of the Jewish
People's Fraternal Order (JPFO) of the International Workers
Order (IWO), Page 6, contained an article which reflected
that the Emma Lazarus Division (ELD) of the JPFO was to
hold its first national convention in New York City on
November 15 and 16, 1947, after having been first established
at a National Women's Conference called three years previously
by the JPFO.
"The Morning Freiheit" (MF) on January 25, 1951,
contained a report of the National Convention of the ELD of
the JPFO which took place in New York City on January 20
and 21, 1951. At this convention, it was noted that the ELD
changed its name to Emma Lazarus Federation of Jewish
Women's Clubs (ELF) and adopted a new constitution.
On May 4, 1966, a source advised that the ELF was
recognized by the Communist Party (CP) United States of America
(USA) as an important national organization of women whose
leadership was primarily made up of Communists. The source.
stated the ELF was dedicated to peace, in protecting the rights
of foreign born, and against bomb testing, Negro discrimination
and the rearmament of West Germany.
The source also stated the ELF renders support to and
receives support from the MF and other Jewish progressive
organizations.
The ELF National Office was moved and is now located
at 150 Fifth Avenue, Room 632, New York, New York.
The IWO and JPFO have been designated
pursuant to Executive Order 10450.

UNITED STATES POLICY IN VIETNAM,
WASHINGTON, D. C.
JANUARY 8, 1968
INFORMATION CONCERNING
The "Kansas City Star" newspaper, Kansas City,
Missouri, edition of January 14, 1968, contained an article
stating that Kansas City women were responding to a "woman
power" appeal issued by Miss Jeanette Rankin, former member
of Congress, to end the war in Vietnam. According to the
article, a small delegation of Kansas City women plan to go
to Washington, D. C., on January 15, 1968, to participate in
the march by the "Jeanette Rankin Brigade" to petition Congress
for a United States withdrawal from Vietnam. The others in
the group would remain in Kansas City and present copies of
the petition to the offices of U. S. Representatives Richard
Bolling, Kansas City, Missouri, and Larry Winn, Kansas City,
Kansas, at 1:00 p.m., on January 15, 1968.
The "Kansas City Star" evening edition of January
15, 1968, carried an article stating that on the afternoon
of January 15, 1968, 20 women appeared at the offices of
Representatives Bolling and Winn. They carried no signs
and the demonstration was orderly. The women, all from the
greater Kansas City area, merely presented a petition asking
Congress to end the war in Vietnam and withdraw American
troops, to make reparations for the "ravaged land we leave
behind in Vietnam", and to listen to the American people
and refuse "the insatiable demands of the military-industrial
complex". The article stated that the Kansas City branch of
the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom
had been planning to send representatives to the Washington
march, but it was not until Wednesday that they decided to
present the petitions to Congressmen Winn and Bolling.
According to the article, Mrs. John M. Swomley, Jr.,
Program Chairman of the organization, stated the Kansas City
group hoped to identify with the women in Washington and their
objective to bring and end to the war in Vietnam.

DEMONSTRATION PROTESTING U.S.
POLICY IN VIETNAM
SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA
JANUARY 15, 1968
Chairman of the Brigade, announced to the demonstrators that this
local demonstration was principally gathered to support women
from around the United States who were gathered in Washington,
D.C. today, as part of a nation-wide demonstration sponsored by
the Jeannette Rankin Brigade, to petition Congress to resolve
the conflict in Vietnam. Bridges stated that inasmuch as it
was not possible for the demonstrators to personally contact
their congressmen, most of whom were out of town%3B that following
the presentation of a petition to Mayor Joseph Alioto, the
demonstrators would then proceed to the Western Union Office on
10th and Market Streets in San Francisco, so that the women
protestors could send wires to their congressmen, protesting
United States policies in Vietnam. Bridges indicated that the
petitioners would request Mayor Alioto to convey to Congress
their petition, which among other things urged Congress, as its
first order of business, to resolve to end the War in Vietnam and
immediately arrange for withdrawal of all American troops from
Vietnam; for Congress to use its power to heal the sick society
at home and to make reparations for the ravaged lands left
behind in Vietnam.
A source advised March 2, 1967, that Mrs. H.
Bridges, also known as
Nikki Bridges, 35
Kronquest Court, San Francisco, California, was
listed as a recipient of a new yearly subscription
to the "People's World" (PW), expiration date
March 4, 1968.
The PW is a west coast communist newspaper,
published weekly in San Francisco.
The next speaker was identified as Aileen Hernandez.
She spoke for approximately five minutes and briefly explained
to the demonstrators who Jeannette Rankin is and what the purposes
of the Jeannette Rankin Brigade are. She stated that the group
has no principal spokesman and it is principally a group of
women who are involved and committed in a fight for peace.
Several of the demonstrators, led by Nikki Bridges,
then proceeded to the Office of Mayor Joseph Alioto to present
their petition.

JANUARY 15, 1968
Approximately ten minutes later the Mayor of
San Francisco appeared on the steps of the City Hall and announced
to the demonstrators that he would gladly transmit their
petition to Congress. Mayor Alioto stated that he fully
believed in the constitutional right of peaceful assembly.
He indicated, however, that because he had consented to
transmit the demonstrators' petition to Washington, he did not
necessarily agree with it. The Mayor then stated that it
was his personal opinion that the United States Government and
the Johnson Administration had done all in its power to attempt
to come to a peaceful and honorable solution in the Vietnamese
War. He related that he felt that it was now up to the other
side to make the same attempts to arrive at a peaceful solution
in the Vietnamese conflict.
At approximately 12:45 p.m., the demonstrators proceeded
to the Western Union Office located at 10th and Market Streets
in San Francisco, so that wires could be sent to their congressmen
in Washington.
A Special Agent of the FBI observed one Elaine
Yoneda participating in the above demonstration and following
the demonstration Yoneda was observed to return to her employment
at the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union
(ILWU) Pacific Maritime Association, Pension Fund, at 150
Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco.
-
A second source advised on December 4, 1967, that
Elaine Yoneda is a current and active member of the Communist
Party (CP).
On January 15, 1968, a Special Agent of the FBI
observed a silent protest by a group of women on the lawn
of Colton Hall, Monterey, California, between 3:00 and 5:00 p.m.
These women were ostensibly gathered to support the demonstration
being held in Washington, D.C., sponsored by the Jeannette Rankin
Brigade. There were no speeches given; the demonstrators merely
conducted a silent vigil.
"
A one page leaflet captioned "Women To Take First
Step to End The War" printed by the Jeannette Rankin Brigade,
at 150 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, California, was handed
out at the above demonstration. A Xeroxed duplication of this
leaflet is appended to this memorandum.

YOU CANNOT HAVE
WARS WITHOUT
WOMEN
Women must use their minds, their voices, and
their bodies to stop the killing in Vietnam; to do
less is to ignore our special responsibilities to
the human race.
"10,000 women have sat back and let their sons
be killed in Vietnam. If we had 10,000 women
willing to go to jail if necessary we could stop
the war in Vietnam. You cannot have wars with-
out women."
Jeannette Rankin made the above statement in
May of this year. Fifty years ago, as the first
woman elected to Congress, she voted against
World War I. She has consistently maintained
her struggle for peace, and at 86 she is as coura-
geous and vigorous as ever--an inspiration to all
women.
The presence of the United States forces in the int
•ernal struggle of Vietnam is immoral and illegal.
There can be no possible justification for our inte
ference in the domestic affairs of this tiny distant
land.
This 86-year-old woman has stated that she is wil
ing to stay in jail until the bombing is stopped. N
all women are free to join her, but we can assure
her that thousands of women will march peacefully
beside her. Some will picket, others will go to ja
with Miss Rankin. Every woman's participation i
equally valuable. We are confident each one will
the maximum of which she is capable.
On January 8th, women from all over the land will
converge on Washington to demand the end of this
dishonorable war. We shall come as individuals,
or as organizations, but we shall join together as
concerned women under the aegis of Jeannette Rar

WASHINGTON, D. C.,
JANUARY 15, 1968
INFORMATION CONCERNING
Reference is made to a memorandum,
captioned as above, dated December 28,
1967, at Miami, Florida. The memorandum
concerned a call issued by the Jeannette
Rankin Brigade for American Women to travel
to Washington, D. C. on January 15, 1968,
to petition the United States Congress to
end the war in Viet Nam.
A source, on January 15, 1968, advised that the Miami
Chapter of the Women's International League for Peace and
Freedom (WILPF) had scheduled a demonstration to take place
January 15, 1968, at Miami, Florida. The demonstration
would be a support activity for the Jeannette Rankin Brigade
that would be in Washington, D. C. on that date to petition
Congress to end the war in Viet Nam.
The January 16, 1968, issue of
the "Miami Herald," a local Miami, Florida
newspaper, contained an article entitled
"Five Thousand Women Join Viet War Protest."
The article identified Jeannette Rankin
as an 87 year old woman pacifist and
former member of Congress who voted in
Congress against the American entry into
both world wars.
A Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of Investi-
gation (FBI) on January 15, 1968, observed an anti-war
demonstration take place in Miami, Florida. Approximately
70 participants, mostly elderly women, assembled at the
Torch of Friendship, Bayfront Park, downtown Miami, at
2:00 p.m. They stood in silent vigil, some wearing black

"Peace On Earth. Good Will To All Men"
"Join Our Silent Vigil For Peace In Viet Nam"
"Vietnamese Are Our Brothers Whom We Kill"
"For A World Without War”
"We Pause To Remember Our Brothers Who Gave Their
Lives In Viet Nam”
Literature distributed identified the sponsor of
the demonstration as the "Women's International League for
Peace and Freedom" (see attached xerox copy).

The participants, following the vigil, continued
their demonstration by walking in single file with the
anti-war signs through the downtown city streets to the
Federal Building where they dispersed at 3:15 p.m.
No incidents were observed to occur.

Source also advised that at least six people from
greater Miami had considered traveling to Washington, D. C.
to participate in the demonstration in that city being
sponsored by the Jeannette Rankin Brigade although no firm
plans had been made. Among these individuals was Greta
Lynch.
A second source in April, 1951, advised
that Greta Lynch that year stated she
had been expelled from the Communist Party
in 1944.

I am proud of the fact that my first vote cast in Congress
was a vote against war. I was the first opportunity for a

to march in a wide circle. In all there were twenty women and
al, One woman had two small children that walked with her.
They were all of the white race. They continued to walk until
1:00 P. M. when they broke up and all left the area. They carried
one sign that read: "JEANNETTE RANKIN BRIGADE - STOP THE WAR

and joined them. After about five or ten minutes they apparently
learned what the demonstration was about and left.

Sergeant McConnell did not know any of the demonstrators.
They were orderly and quiet. There were no incidents and no
threats were made.
An article appearing in the September 20, 1967, issue of
"THE ST. LOUIS POST DISPATCH" on page 3 C read as follows:
"A Peace Information Center will be opened at
6217 Delmar Boulevard with ceremonies at 8:00 P. M.
today. The Center will contain literature on foreign
affairs, economics and social problems. Information
concerning alternatives under the Selective Service Act
and individual counseling for young men will be provided

of Congress on January 15, 1968. On January 16, 1968, they would

eting demonstration on the sidewalk counter clockwise around
the block encompassing the Pioneer Branch, U.S. Post Office

black clothing, carried black umbrellas and some carried signs
with wording, "No More War" and "The Women's Vote is a Vote
for Peace". A small number of the black umbrellas contained
white block letters on top with wording, "Peace is our Shelter".
The majority of participants were the same as in
previous demonstrations against U.S. policy in Vietnam and

************* Jeannette Rankin Brigade********* P.O. Box 993
Ross, Calit.
Oct. 26, 1967
Here it is, the long-awaited first call upon women to join the
Jeannette Rankin Brigade. I'm enclosing copies --hope you can
find means to duplicate these for your community.
Much has happened since I talked to --exciting things, much
response, and some firm dates. A great deal of time was spent with
Miss Rankin in order to do this in the way that she felt was best. A
there were other very important things already in the hopper, such as
Women Strike for Peace in Washington on Sept. 29, and the tremendous
Stop the Draft "eek of Oct. 16 - 21, all taking the time and energies
of the peace groups.
The next full-scale convergence of women throughout the land wil
be the Jeannette Rankin Brigade. We will go to Washington on January
We will endeavor to enter the !!.S. Congress to present our demand for
end to the war.
These plans will be formally announced on November 11
Veterans Lay (formerly Armistice Day), when Miss Rankin will issue the
. Call to the women of the nation.
Now is the time to organize those in your community, to find tho
who can go to "ashington and those who will support us by lending the
names on helping in other ways. Now is the time to bring this
churches, P.T.A. 's and women's organizations, including union auxiliar
ies.
up
in
We have been in touch with many men, important in their fields
labon, retired generals, professors, etc. -- who have offerred to spon-
sor the Brigade. But it was decided to have only women as national
sponsors. Among these at present are Dagmar Wilson, Cloretta King,
Ruth Krause, Esther Pike, and Jessica Mitford. Interested men are be-
ing invited to join a "Men's Auxiliary", to help with fund-raising, ex
Milone on this anon. Several clergymen in the Bay Area have agreed to
preach sermons on the subject of women and their responsibility of
working to oppose war.
:
Idens for supportive action in local communities are needed and
welcome. Please let me know what you are doing and planning.
Yours for peace,

train appeared to be nearly full. It arrived at Union
Station, Washington, D.C., shortly after twelve noon.
The large group of women proceeded to Grant Park which is

formed around 1936 in New York City, and that the Chicago
Chapter of the NLG (CCNLG), which is affiliated with the

✓ California JRB Committee. They were Bobbie Hodges, Althea _
Alexander, and Glory Roberts. Two women affiliated with
the peace-oriented Pasadena Chapter of the Women's International
League for Peace and Freedom; Cathy Hofer and Marian Beardsley,
were also to join the above women for the flight to Washington,
according to Source One.
On January 15, 1968, Special Agents of the Los Angeles
Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation observed a
group of women assemble in front of the Old State Building, 217
West First Street (First and Broadway, in the downtown Civic
Center), Los Angeles, California, at approximately 9:30 AM.
The women were carrying placards indicating they were the
local representation of the JRB. They also had two leaflets
for distribution (Xerox copies of which are appended to this
memorandum) which called for women to participate and which
indicated that a voting block of American women had the power
to put an end to the war in Vietnam. These leaflets bore the
address of the JRB as 5899 West Pico Boulevard, Los Angeles,
California (90019), which is the address of the headquarters of
the WSP in Southern California.
Malen
Starting shortly after 10:00 AM, the women proceeded
to hold a rally on the south steps of the Old State Building,
with the speakers utilizing an electronic amplification system,
which was held by actress Leslie Parrish.
Source One indicated that Parrish had originally been
scheduled to fly to Washington, D. C., to participate in the
JRB action at the Capitol, but changed her plans at the last
minute in order to remain in Los Angeles.
The rally was headed by Tima Tomash, who acted as
the local JRB organizer and answered some of the questions
regarding the JRB from members of the news media on the scene.
Veronica Sissons acted as mistress of ceremonies. Speakers
included Mary Henry, Negro civil rights and poverty worker;
Margaret Wright (who has been identified by Sources One and
Two as a militant black nationalist, who has been extremely
active in recent months in disturbances at Manual Arts High
School, Los Angeles, which resulted in a court injunction to
prohibit her entering those school grounds); and television
actress Ellen McRae. The speakers all called for a coalition
of women to form a strong voting block which could produce
legislation to end the war in Vietnam, end poverty and "legislated
injustice".

black), and eight non-Caucasian adults were involved, plus
some youngsters and infants. The mother of one of the children
had a cardboard sign, depicting a bomb and the caption, "I'm
Glad I'm Not Vietnamese", strapped to the back of her son who
appeared to be less than four years of age.
With Veronica Sissons again acting as mistress of
ceremonies; the rally was addressed by Charlotte Sherman,
Margaret Wright, Tima Tomash, and Jill Schary. The latter/
was introduced as a radio commentator employed by Los Angeles
Radio Station KLAC. She joined the others in calling for a
coalition of women to influence legislation and bring an end to
the war in Vietnam. She also called for support of other "liberal
radio broadcasters on our side", one of whom she named as
William Winter. (The "Daily People's World", west coast
communist newspaper, in its edition of June 11, 1946, described
William Winter as chairman of a local citizens' committee to
safeguard the Joint Anti-Fascist Refuge Committee, which
organization has been cited pursuant to Executive Order 10450).
Charlotte Sherman was introduced as the wife of
Laurence Sherman, it being pointed out that he was an
unsuccessful candidate for public office, on a peace slate,
during 1967, but that both he and his wife were continuing the
fight for an end to the war in Vietnam. She said, "It is time
for us to re-examine our role. as women. Women are a vehicle
for giving life. We will not be a vehicle for perpetuation
of wars She then read some anti-war quotes from Henry David
Thoreau, indicating they were as timely today, as when he wrote
them.
!!
Margaret Wright stated that whereas the majority of
women in the demonstration were wearing black to denote mourning,
that she and her non-Caucasian associates who feel, "Black is
beautiful" were dressed in white to indicate their attitude of
mourning. She called for the elimination of ROTC (Reserve
Officers Training Corps) from local high schools and junior
colleges, adding, "They have got to get live bullets out of the
schools, and get some live teachers in. She repeated these
same statements during the afternoon when the JRB moved to
the Los Angeles City Board of Education.
As the rally was breaking up, Wright grabbed the
public address system and said that it had been learned that
the City Council was in session inside the City Hall Building.

DEMONSTRATION PROTESTING UNITED STATES POLICY
IN VIETNAM, WASHINGTON, D. C., JANUARY 15, 1968
INFORMATION CONCERNING (INTERNAL SECURITY)
Reference is made to prior memoranda captioned as
above, including those dated December 12 and 30, 1967 and
January 11, 1968, from Los Angeles, California.
FORMER C.PRW

Source One reported that the final local planning
meeting of the Jeannette Rankin Brigade (JRB) Committee in
Southern California, was held on January 11, 1968, in the
offices of the Women Strike for Peace (WSP) (see appendix),
5899 West Pico Boulevard, Los Angeles. A communication was
received from Mary Clarke (see characterization in appendix
page on WSP) indicating that she and Vivian Hallinan of San
Francisco, California, were already in Washington, D. C.,
making final arrangements for the JRB action to be held in
that city on January 15, 1968. Clarke indicated that she and
Mrs. Hallinan had already received numerous queries from
representatives of the Washington news media regarding proposed
action to be taken by the JRB. She also noted that it might
be necessary to re-route the proposed JRB march on the Capitol,
in view of some "1882 Law" relating to demonstrations in the
vicinity of the Capitol building.
According to Source One the women from Southern
California, travelling to participate in the Washington JRB
action, were to leave Los Angeles Saturday night, January 13,
1968, via American Airlines Flight 78. Most of them were to
return to Los Angeles, from Dulles International Airport, on
Tuesday, January 16, 1968, via American Airlines Flight 75.
As of January 12, 1968, the following women affiliated
with WSP were scheduled to travel from Southern California to
Washington for the JRB-demonstration: Eva Korn, Mary Lewis,
Bea Glass, Florence Temkin, Mildred Holland, Ada Wasserman,
Joyce Miller Angus, Leslie Parrish, Pat Lavit, Geraldine
Shapiro, Beverly Bruce and Florence White; according to Source
One.

She urged the women not to disperse, but to join her and...
others in invading the City Council Chambers with a demand
that the JRB be allowed to speak to the Council even though
they had not made previous arrangements for a place on the
agenda that day. Some of the women were already out of range
of the public address system and did not hear this announcement
by Wright, having already been dismissed by. Sissons and told to
reconvene at the Board of Education following luncheon,
Approximately 200 of the demonstrators did enter
the Council Chambers. They got word to the councilmen, through.
one of the staff members, that they wished to be heard.
A motion to allow a JRB representative to address them was
put before the Council, and defeated by a vote of six to five.
Immediately following this vote, there was a unanimous vote
that the Council adjourn. As the councilmen filed out of the
room, Tima Tomash rushed to the front shouting demands that
they return, while other of the women hissed and booed the
city legislators.
During the noon hour some of the women distributed · ·
leaflets in the City Hall and on the surrounding streets in
the downtown Civic Center.

At 1:00 PM, the women, whose numbers had by that
time been reduced to 125, massed in the patio of the Los
Angeles City Board of Education, 450 North Grand Avenue,
Los Angeles. Sissons, Wright and Tomash addressed-the
assembled demonstrators, pointing out that money spent in
Vietnam could be better spent in education. Wright claimed
that many of the so-called student "drop-outs" are in reality
"push-outs"
claiming that she herself was one of the latter.
She said, "We need books, not bombs. We know this is a racist
war and we blacks are not going to fight a racist war": She
∙indicated that rather than fight overseas, the black people
would remain at home and fight the racists. She also said,
"Just because I'm pro-black doesn't necessarily mean I'm anti-
white.
"
Wright said, "I'm not political, but I am honest. I
can't honestly get up and say the pledge of allegiance to the
American flag, because I really don't have liberty and justice3B
so I just get up and stand and won't repeat the pledge.
Later, when she observed a photograph of President Johnson
hanging from a wall in the Administration Building at the
Los Angeles City Board of Education, she told the JRB women
with her, "We shouldn't have to look at such pornographic
pictures.

Wright said that her arrest at the hands of Los
Angeles City School Security Officers, during the recent.
Manual Arts High School disturbance, had at least one bright
result.
She said that at the time of her arrest it had been
necessary for the arresting officers to drag her down the
hall as she was too heavy for them to carry. Then she added
that the next time she is arrested the officers will not have
that excuse as she has lost thirty pounds in the meantime.
The speeches in the patio ended at 1:30 PM and many
of the women left immediately. Seventy-eight women remained.
and attempted to enter a special committee meeting being attended
by some of the School Board members. They were informed by a
member of the administrative staff that the public meeting of the
School Board would not be held until 4:00 PM, the regularly
scheduled meeting time. The women milled around in the hallway
outside the meeting room, until finally a staff member came out
and told them that two members of the School Board, Reverend
James E. Jones and Dr. Julian Nava, had agreed to grant them an
audience. The women were then ushered into the public board
room of the School Board where they waited until 2:00 PM at
which time the above-named Board members granted the demonstrators
a short audience and answered some questions put to them by the
Women. One question, as to how much longer the members of the
School Board were going to permit recruiters from the armed
forces to interview students at local-high schools and junior.
colleges remained unanswered, but Dr. Nava pointed out to the
women that he had seen nothing wrong in entering the armed-
forces to fight for this country himself when he was 17 years
of age; and he could see nothing wrong in other young men who
wanted to do the same today. The demonstration was concluded
by 3:00 PM. There were no incidents and no arrests.
Placards carried during this demonstration in Los
Angeles bore the following captions:
"Eat Texas Beef, Not L.B.J. Baloney"
"Woman Power is Vote Power is Peace Power"
"Draft Beer Not Students"
"Where Have All the Men Gone-To Graveyards
"Jeannette Rankin Brigade-Women's Votes Count, End
the War"
"Women's Power is Peace Power."

dressed in black and they were carrying signs indicating they
represented the JFB. Other signs being carried during the ensuing
demonstration read, "Support Dr. Spock.". They marched around
the courthouse until 11:00 AM, when the demonstration was con-
cluded with no incidents or arrests. Else Sturm identified .

of the Communist Party (CP) from at least 1940
to 1950, and as a member of the New York State
CP School Commission during a portion of that
period.
Source Four identified Else Sturm as a member of
the CP in Chicago, Illinois, in December, 1946.
Source One reported during June, 1967, that Florence
Temkin, was an official in the Women for Legislative Action
(WLA see appendix), as well as being active in the Council
of the WSP.

WOMEN FOR LEGISLATIVE ACTION
A source advised on May 1, 1963, that the Women
for Legislative Action was formed in 1952, claiming to be
an inter.ndent organization dedicated to non-partisan parti-
cipation in legislative and civic activities. Its position
in favoring or opposing legislation usually parallels the
position of the Communist Farty and related groups. It also
sumports legislation to abolish the House Committee on Un-
American Activities. Membership in the Women for Legislative
Action does not, of itself, connote membership in or sympathy
with the Communist Party.
Another source advised on May 11, 1967, that the
Women fo: Legislative Action continues to be active in the
Los Angeles area.

COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF THE
WOMEN STRIKE FOR PEACE,
Also Known As
Women's International Strike for Peace
It
A source advised on May 14, 1967, that the Women
Strike for Peace (WSP) in the Southern California area began
its operations in the late fall of 1961, as an affiliate
of the national organization formed in Washington, D.C.
is a peace oriented women's organization which is opposed
to the present American foreign policy in Vietnam. It has
also sought legislation which would bring about the abolition
of the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HCUA).
recent months the organization has sponsored demonstrations
protesting the United States involvement in Vietnam and
calling for the complete withdrawal of all United States
troops from Vietnam. In the spring of 1966, it was instrumental
in originating and putting into effect a campaign advocating
support for "peace candidates" in the upcoming 1966 Congressional
elections.
The same source stated that WSP is a non-membership
organization and has no officers. The organization is open
to women of all political opinions who are interested in world.
peace. It makes no effort to exclude from its activities.
members of, or persons sympathetic to, the Communist Party
and related groups.
The guiding force behind the Southern California
WSP groups is MARY CLARKE. A second source advised in July,
1955, that CLARKE was dropped from the Western Division, Los
Angeles County Communist Party (LACCP) in the Spring of 1955,
for personal reasons and not because of any political differences
with the LACCP.
The first source advised that Southern California
WSP maintains its office at 5899 West Pico Boulevard, Los
Angeles. It receives mail through Post Office Box 19739,
Los Angeles 19, California.

WOMEN'S INTERNATIONAL LEAGUE FOR PEACE AND FREEDOM (TE
In a leaflet dated January, 1962, WILPF described
itself as follows:
:
"What is the WILPF?
*
"It is the Women's International League for
Peace and Freedom, an international, inter-
racial organization striving for peace and
freedom by nor-violent democratic methods.
It was founded in 1915, during the first
World War, and its first president was JANE
ADDAMS, the first American woman to win the
Nobel Peace Prize.
"How Does it Work?
"It keeps its membership informed on current
problems through its legislative office in
Washington. It issues its own pamphlets,
study kits, fact sheets, and cooperates with
like-minded organizations. WILPF has con-
sultative status at the United Nations on a
national and international level.
"What Does it Do?
"WILPF, through its local branches, sponsors
public discussion on such topics as disarma-
ment and world law, nuclear testing, civil
defense, Berlin, civil rights, etc. Through
its Peace Action Committee, WILH initiates
peace walks, vigils, and meetings, as an
organization and with other peace groups.
Peace education for children is a special
concern of WILPF:
"How Is it Set Up?
"The Women's International League for Peace and
Freedom has its national headquarters at JANE
ADDAMS House, 2006 Walnut Street, Philadelphia 3,
Pa., where its monthly Daner, FOUR LIGHTS, is
published. Its legislative office is at 120
Maryland Avenue, N.E., Washington 2, D. C.
· International headquarters are in Geneva. The
International meets every three years. It
conducts summer schools, peace congresses and
publishes its magazine, PAX."

y
The January 16, 1968, edition of the "Courier-Journal",
a Louisville, Kentucky, newspaper of general circulation,
reflected an article that reported that Jeannette Rankin and
some 5,000 other women marched near the United States Capitol
in Washington, D.C. on January 15, 1968. The article further
reflected the group was known as the Jeannette Rankin Brigade
and that the purpose of the march was to protest the Vietnam war.
It was indicated therein that the marchers were
"met by a seemingly disinterested Washington and a reconvening
90th Congress that, not unexpectedly, paid them little heed."
Miss Jeannette Rankin, described in the article as
the march leader and first woman member of congress, and .
thirteen others presented a petition to two congressional
leaders. One Sarah Burnside, Richmond, Kentucky, is depicted
as a member of this group and a delegate from Appalachia.

The demonstration, described as peaceful, included

SOUTHERN CONFERENCE EDUCATIONAL FUND, INC. (SCEF)
The Southern Conference for Human Welfare (SCHW)
was cited as a Communist front by the House Committee on
Un-American Activities, House Report 592, June 12, 1947.
In the same house report, "The Southern Patriot" was cited
as an "organ" of the SCHW.
An amendment to the charter of the SCHW dated
April 26, 1946, changed its name to the Southern Conference
Educational Fund, Incorporated (SCEF) and stated its purpose
to be to improve the educational and cultural standards of
the Southern people in accordance with the highest
American democratic institutions, traditions and ideals.
The masthead of the April, 1967, issue of
"The Southern Patriot" indicates that it is the publication
of SCEF, editorial and business offices of which are
located at 3210 West Broadway, Louisville, Kentucky,
Eastern office of which is located at Suite 412, 799
Broadway, New York City. New York. "The Southern Patriot"
is published once each month, except July. SCEF is stated
to be dedicated to ending discrimination based on race,
creed, color, sex, national origin or economic condition.
Carl Braden is identified as Executive Director
of SCEF and Anne Braden as editor of "The Southern Patriot.'
Mrs. Alberta Ahearn, 2311 Payne Street, Louisville,
Kentucky, a self-admitted former member of the Communist
Party (CP), Louisville, Kentucky, testified on December 11,
and 13, 1954, in Jefferson County, Kentucky Criminal Court
in a State sedition prosecution against Carl James Braden.
She identified Carl Braden and his wife, Anne McCarty Braden,
as having been known to her as members of the CP from
January, 1951 to December, 1954.
The SCEF is self-described as having deep roots
in the South where it began as the educational wing of the
SCHW, organized in 1938 to work for economic and political
reform. When the SCHW disbanded in the late 1940's, SCEF

SCEF (Continued)
continued as an independent organization, rallying support
for integration and democracy and helping to stimulate
and nurture new movements of the early 1960's. The SCEF
maintained headquarters in Louisiana for twenty years,
in 1966 moved its headquarters to Louisville, Kentucky.
but
A source advised on March 2, 1961, that Claude
Lightfoot, a Communist Party functionary, stated at a meeting
of the Communist Party in Baltimore, Maryland, on February 25,
1961, that the Communist Party is not connected with any
progressive movement but indirectly they do have some influence
in the SCEF.
A second source, who is familiar with some phases
of Communist Party activity in the New Orleans area, advised
on June 3, 1966, that during the time that the SCHW was in
existence, members of the Communist Party were members of
and worked actively in the SCHW; however, since the formation
of the SCEF, Communist Party members have not been encouraged
to work in the SCEF. The source stated that the SCEF is
a progressive, liberal organization, which he considers a
Communist Party front organization because it has gone along
with the Communist Party on certain issues, particularly
on the racial issue.
A third source advised on May 25, 1965, that
George Meyers, a Communist Party functionary, expressed
great admiration for Carl and Anne Braden and the SCEF,
with which they are affiliated, and expressed the view
that the SCEF is the best organization in the South
as doing effective work is concerned and that they have a
better idea of what they are doing, where they are heading,'
and influence other organizations for the better.
as far
The second source also advised on June 3, 1966,
that many people who are officials and supporters of the
SCEF, while liberal in their views, are by no means Communists.

FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE
1
The April 6, 1960, edition of "The New York Times"
newspaper contained a full-page advertisement captioned
"What Is Really Happening In Cuba," placed by the Fair Play
for Cuba Committee (FPCC). This advertisement announced the
formation of the FPCC in New York City and declared the FPCC
intended to promulgate "the truth about revolutionary Cuba" to
neutralize the distorted American press:
"The New York Times" edition of January 11, 1961,
reported that at a hearing conducted before the United States
Senate Internal Security Subcommittee on January 10, 1961,
Dr. Charles A. Santos-Buch identified himself and Robert Taber
as organizers of the FPCC. He also testified he and Taber
obtained funds from the Cuban Government which were applied
toward the cost of the aforementioned advertisement.
On May 16, 1963, a source advised that during the
first two years of the FPCC's existence there was a struggle
between Communist Party (CP) and Socialist Workers Party(SWP)
elements to exert their power within the FPCC and thereby
influence FPCC policy. This source added that during the past
year there had been a successful effort by FPCC leadership to
minimize the role of these and other organizations in the FPCC
so that their influence as of May, 1963, was negligible.
The SWP has been designated pursuant to Executive
Order 10450.
TII
On May 20, 1963, a second source advised that Vincent
"Ted" Lee, FPCC National Office Director, was then formulating
FPCC policy and had indicated that he had no intention of
permitting FPCC policy to be determined by any other organization.
This source stated that Lee believed that the FPCC should.
advocate resumption of diplomatic relations between Cuba and
the United States and should support the right of
Cubans to manage their revolution without interference from
other nations. Lee did not advocate supportir; the Cuban
revolution per se.
The November 23, 1963, edition of "The New York Times"
reported that Senator Thomas J. Dodd of Connecticut had called
FPCC "the chief public relations instrument of the Castro network
in the United States." It is to be noted that Senator Dodd was
a member of the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee which
twice conducted hearings on the FPCC.

LORENTIAL
LUBA COMMITTEE (CONT'D)
The December 27, 1963, edition of "The New York World
legram and Sun" newspaper stated that the pro-Castro FPCC
was seeking to go out of business and that its prime activity
during its lifetime had been sponsorship of pro-Castro street
rallies and mass picket lines, and the direction of an active
propaganda mill highlighting illegal travel-to-Cuba campaigns.
Its comparatively brief span of life was attributed to mounting
anti-Castro American public opinion, the 1962 Congressional
hearings which disclosed FPCC financing by Castro's United
Natiors Delegation, and ultimately, the bad publicity which
the FPCC received from disclosure of activities on its behalf
by suspected presidential assassin Lee H. Oswald.
On February 6, 1964, the previously mentioned second
source advised that V. T. Lee had recently remarked that the
FPCC was dead and that there were no plans to organize another
similar organization.
On April 13, 1964, a third source advised that there
had not been any FPCC activity in many months and that the
FPCC had been dissolved.

Milwaukee files do reflect additional information
concerning LEA BETTY ZELDIN, Security Index subject. This
information concerned data from a confidential source
abroad (Italian Armed Forces Intelligence Service to the
effect that ZELDIN, while in Bologna, Italy in 1966, attended
meetings and participated in rallies of the Italian Communist
Party.
This information has not been included in the enclosed
LHM inasmuch as it is classified "Secret" and would therefore
necessitate classification of LHM as "Secret". It is felt
that ZELDIN is adequately described through public sources
as set forth in LHM as an anti-Vietnam demonstrator.

"found guilty of contempt in the U.S. District

A summary of SWAP's activities distributed at the meeting

TAIMI HALONEN and THORUN ROBEL were mildly self-
critical about not working for the programs the younger women
were promoting. TAIMI said she was tired after working long
hours on the Seattle conference to be held Saturday, January
20th at Mt. Zion Baptist Church in Seattle at which the
Seattle delegation would report. HALONEN made the observation,
however, that the women working on the program were all very
experienced leaders and she trusted they would formulate a
satisfactory program.
On Monday, January 15, 1968, the delegates including
the group from Washington State, met at the Union Station in
Washington, D C. It was learned here that the instructions
which had been given the day before at the Shoreham Hotel were
evidently for the California group only, because many California
people had been badly beaten in previous demonstrations and
they were very cautious and somewhat apprehensive. The
official pattern was different. Mimeographed sheets headed
"Jearrette Rankin Brigade - Information and Instructions" were
passed out and these appeared to be the official instructions.
A reproduction is attached.
f
The Washington State delegation was enlarged when a
Mrs BACKUP from Tacoma arrived. RADER said some of the money
usually received from wealthy contributors had been collected
by Mrs. BACKUP. Reverend HAROLD BASS of Tacoma collected
$170.00, and wanted someone else to go instead of ZEFRA
(STUDAMIRE), RADER defended herself when TAIMI HALONEN criticized
her for bringing ZEFRA along since ZEFRA is at least six months
_ pregnant.
After the demonstration, HEALY and RADER spent much
of the time urging the speakers to include in their talks some-
thing about the status of the American Indian. ELLA BAKER from
New York did include a paragraph from the paper the Washington
State delegation submitted to Congress. This was entitled,
"American indians and the Struggle for Peace". It had been
prepared by LONNIE HEALY although at its bottom it carried the
notation "(Prepared by the Jeannette Rankin Brigade Delegation
from Washington State)."
RADER, HEALY, and CORR became indignant because the
audience did not give a standing ovation to Mrs. MARTIN L. KING,
Jr. or any of the Negro speakers.

After some sightseeing in the afternoon, HALONEN,
ROBEL, and Mrs. BACKUP checked into the Plaza Hotel since
they were going to stay a day or two longer for some workshops.
RADER stayed also. The rest of the group, HEALY, CORR, ZEFRA
(STUDAMIRE), CASSIDY, and FRENCH went to Friendship Airport
and boarded UAL Flight 41 for Seattle.
While in Washington, HEALY kept trying to call a
CARL BLOICE who the source thought used to be either in Seattle
or San Francisco, but she never reached him.
The workshops held on January 15th after the march were:
(1)
Legislative Action

(4) New Women in New World

(6) Resistance

CASSIDY, a member of that club, reported on her trip to Washington,

MARJORIE RADER got an eye infection which kept her from going to

HEALY expressed great dissatisfaction with the
basic organization of the gathering. She wanted an organi-
zational meeting instead of a rally type meeting which
occurred. HALONEN and ROBEL agreed somewhat. HEALY implied
the whole thing was a waste of her time.
In the workshop section of the meeting, HALONEN
worked in the legislative action section%3B HELEN FRENCH and
ELAINE HORSLEY in the electoral campaigns; and HEALY and
CORR in racism. Here, too, the younger women were very
critical. HEALY, particularly, resented having men as
"resource people" for the group. She said she thought this
was a women's congress. TAIMI said she found herself in a
situation that was quite different in that she was working
with a very broad spectrum of politically and economically oriented
individuals and it was a real learning experience.. ELAINE
HORSLEY was anxious to get back home and work for peace while
the spirit of JEANNETTE RANKIN was still fresh. She and
HELEN FRENCH expressed the view the congress met the needs
of American women in giving a concrete program on which to work.
Tuesday, January 16, 1968, was for lobbying. The
Seattle and Tacoma people were told to meet at the Methodist
Building, 100 Maryland Avenue. HALONEN, ROBEL, HEALY, HORSLEY,
and HELEN FRENCH arrived before the appointed time. After about
an hour, EMELIA CASSIDY arrived stating RADER had an eye problem
and would be unable to attend. Mrs. BACKUP joined the group.
LINDA CORR and ZEFRA were too tired to get up so early. The
group called on Washington State's Senators JACKSON and MAGNUSON,
but they were not in their offices. After leaving a copy of
the women's petition and a questionnaire prepared by the
Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (see attachment)
they called on Washington State's Congressmen FLOYD HICKS and
BROCK ADAMS. Mr. HICKS was out of town. Mrs. HORSLEY knew, the.
Congressman personally and her son knew two of the office
personnel. She asked that they relate to him that she was
vitally interested in peace and social justice.
Congressman BROCK ADAMS was in his office and spent
about twenty minutes talking with the group concerning his
political views and some of the political machinations of his
party. The group then began to disintegrate. ELAINE HORSLEY
left to get a 2:30 flight to Boston where she would visit her
son who is attending Harvard University.

The source went on to say CP member CORR, a Negro,
had a display of Negro dolls which she was selling to raise
funds to send to the South "to help fight the battle there."
Opening remarks at the meeting were along socialistic
lines, according to the source. The principal speaker said

The group then separated into workshops on such topics
as welfare, schools. law, young people, working women, and
draft resistance. When these smaller groups reassembled,
after lunch, some of the delegates to the Jeannette Rankin
Brigade affair at Washington, D.C. gave short talks.
The
speakers included HALONEN, HEALY, CORR, RUBEL, and CASSIDY
from Tacoma), all of when ta e Lean characterized before as

want their sons to go away to fight a rich man's war. They
stated wars had not proved anything in the past and had been
run by men; Now the women should come to the front and tell
the mer they are pot raising their sons for carnon fodder. The
group attending the welfare workshop presented a resolution in
support of a black women's lobby to Olympia (the capital of
Washington State). A heated debate arose between some of the
white women present and three Neuroes

troubles might be attributed to the fact STUDAMIRE is expecting
a baby in April. CASSIDY stated there were too many rules to
follow.
The delegates weren't premitted to carry a nail file,
wear peace buttons, or exhibit RANKIN buttons. They had to walk
six abreast and were not allowed to march around the White
House. She said a suit will be brought in court for this
denial of their rights. She went on to state each person had
or was given $10.00 to carry on his person so he could not
be arrested for vagrancy.
CASSIDY said a nurse, Mrs. HELEN M. COCK, had been
very helpful to the group. COOK told CASSIDY she could be reached
at 719 Beechwood Road, Media, Pennsylvania, if more information
is desired concerning Veterans for Peace, which was not further
described.
GUY RADER, a CP member at this meeting, tried to stop
CASSIDY when the latter complained ZEFRA STUDAMIRE was too
immature to have been sent to the conference, but CASSIDY wasn't
easy to stop. She was incensed over the fact money had been used
for STUDAMIRE's trip and the latter refused to cooperate. RADER
and STUDAMIRE remained in Washington, D.C. after the conference
to handle some business with the Student Non-Violent Coordinating
Committee (SNCC) according to CASSIDY.

NDIANS AND THE STRUGGLE F
E
Today, in Battle Creek, Michigan, the city's scal, adopted in 1591,
racist and violent because it pictures a white man hitting an (narmed
Incian with a riffe butt. Some Indian youth view the television program
Custer" as indicative of racist America. The National Congress of American
Indians opposes unis distortion of history. Beatings and murder of Indians
in Maine gɔ unchallenged. Congress voted in 195 to open up Indian land
reservations to state jurisdiction. In actuality, this rides established
tribal courts and federal jurisdiction. It gives local bigoted authorities
more opportunity to harrass and open the way to termination of our treaties
and in several places resulted in actual loss of land.
It is as deadly to be an Indian in America as it is to be a soldier
in Viet Nam. In the three years before 1907, more Indian children below the
age of 1û had died in this country than the 6,628 U. S. combat casualties of
the entire Viet Nam War (as of the end of 1966). Most of these were children
below the age of six.
The price we pay is the built-in racism our children are taught in
school, over television, in cartoons; the Indian has become a joke to white
Americans. We pay because we don't know our own history.
The thread of struggle for self-determination runs through the history
of Indian-Americans. When a few Indian youth speak of Red Power, the roots go
deep into their history in finding nourishment for this demand. Just as some
Negro leaders today speak of W.E.B. DuBois as having raised the same issue of
identity long before the level of struggle, which is Black Power, arrived.
This struggle has gone on for 400 years.
The Indian people have been sending spokesmen to bring their grievances
and their positions before the power structure of this country for two hundred
years. They have fought in the courts since at least 1830 when the case of
the Cherokee Nation vs. Georgia tested the ability and the willingness of the
United States to protect an Indian Tribe in its efforts at self-determination.
The Vietnamese war is a continuation of the whole racist war we have
waged against the Indian People. Understanding this is a part of understanding
the Viet Nam war. We respond to what is happening to Vietnamese children, yet
the Indian people have suffered from the same policy of extermination and
destruction of their identity.
We must unite with the strivings of those who have had to deal with
United States' genocide for 200 years!
We can help to push the United States to ratify the United Nations
Resolution, "Treaty Against Genocide", that the United States should correct
the history and policy of genicide against the Indian people. Today this
refers to the destruction of their identity as a people and links with the
struggles of people for their identity all over the world. To stop the policy
of genocide, of racism, to develop compensatory steps to undo the effects of
the crimes against the Indian people, to remove the oppression of the Indian
people!
-
10
All the forces in this country cannot win democratic power without
making this correction of what was done to the American Indian people.

free speech and the right to petition their government for a redress of
grievances.
Upon informing the Capitol Police of their planned march to the Capitol building
to present their petition, the women were threatened with arrest under 40 U.S.C.
193 (a) et. seg. which, after defining the area considered Capitol Grounds, states:
"It is forbidden to parade, stand, or move in processions
or assemblages in said United States Capitol Grounds, or to
display therein any flag, banner, or device designed or
adapted to bring into public notice any party, organization,,
or movement....
The statute further provides that exceptions from these prescriptive provisions
will be made in the discretion of certain Congressional leaders and/or Capitol
Police. The exceptions are allowed on "ocassions of national interest becoming
the congnizance and entertainment of Congress."
The petition of the Jeannette Rankin Brigade apparently does not become "the
entertainment of Congress" and arrests were threatened. Therefore the suit which
was files prays for the convening of a three-judge Federal District Court which
is requested to enjoin the operation and enforcement of the statute and to
declare it unconstitutional. We have asked the Federal District Court for the
District of Columbia to grant us this relief on an emergency basis prior to
January 15th. Our request was denied. The same request was made to the District
of Columbia Court of Appeals and was likewise denied. As it was then impossible
to obtain relief prior to January 15th the Brigade's attorneys are continuing the
appeal on a non-emergency basis in the Court of Appeals and have every confidence
of ultimate victory.
This is far from the last time that these women or any other Americans intend
to appear in their nation's Capitol to petition their government.
will be the last time that they find it so difficult to do so.

WELFARE FACING
at ry of Rodern Welfar
Trams
Edern welfare programs in the United States be with passage of
the Social Security Act--fn 1935, authorizing federal grants to
states for public assistance and child welfare programs, In 1937,
the Washington Legislature repealed the Poupers Law of 185 and
enacted a State Social Security Law. "Welfare" has been a bone of
contention ever since.
Greenleigh Report
*
In 1963, the Washington Legislature appropriated $20,000 for a study
of the state's public assistance programs. The study was made by
Greenleigh Associates, and the Greenleigh Report was presented in
December, 1964.
This report stated that public assistance grants in
Washington, with standar s based on 1959 prices and
12% ratable reductions,' e 40% below the minimum
standards for health and decency. Speaking of child
welfare needs, the report said: "There is an excessive
and increasing rate of referral of children to the
Juvenile Courts, both for dependency and delinquency.
There is an excessive and increasing trend for children
to be removed from their natural families and cared
for elsewhere,"
WHAT ABOUT RATABLE REDUCTIONS?
The 1965 Legislature removed the ratable reductions. The 1967
Legislature ordered the Dept. of Public Assistance to bring it's
pricing standard's up to 1967 levels.
New standards were put into effect July first. Increased allowances
for rent vary from county to county. Other allowances were increased
an average of 10-3/4% In King County the total increase was 16%.
Thus, King County grants have been increased by 28% since 1964,
but the cost of living has increased by at least 5%. Grants are stil
17% less than acceptable levels.
The maximum grant for a Seattle family consisting of
two adults, a boy 13, and a girl 8, is $285.80 a
month--$3,429 a year. But recent changes in the
Federal Social Security Law cast a shadow on even
this figure. The local welfare officials will not
offer any guess as to what my happen next, NEW RATABLE
REDUCTIONS ARE ALWAYS A POSSIBILITY.
There is much talk of getting people off welfare by putting them to
work. Yet who will take care of the children? Child care costs from
$60 to $80 per child per month in Seattle.

OH,
A source stated REE ANN
daughter of OIVA
HALONEN, who was then the Chairman of the Communist Party's,
Industrial Section at Seattle, had said on July 29, 1957,
that the youth group in Seattle was considering adoption

A second source advised a meeting of the Communist
Party (CP) Downtown Club in Seattle was held on October 30,
1958. WANDA HUBBARD, CP member, stated she was the youth
director of the Young Political Fxplorers. She stated there
were two groups in Washington, and the Seattle group had
fifteen active members. The age limits were from twelve to
twenty years of age. The purpose of the group was to examine
all political ideas, including socialism.
A third source also reported on the CP Downtown Club
meeting on October 30, 1958. WANDA HUBBARD stated the youths
had chosen the names of Young Political Explorers, which is a
statewide CP organization and was formerly known as the Labor
Youth League. HUBBARD stated it is directly supported and
directed by the CP.

On February 23, 1960, & >
PATIVE (WCC), ‘aka
Association
reported the Communist
Party (CP), Northwest District Cove, at a meeting in
January, 1960, decided to prepare for opening a cooperative.
bookstore and directed the CP State Board to set up a Party
committee for this purpose:
The above source also reported that at a state-wide
CP conference held on August 27, 1960, CP District Chairman
BURT NELSON reported on the WCC. NELSON announced the committee
was determined to have the bookstore opened by the earliest
possible date, probably October 15, (1960). He urged support
of the WCC.
•
A second source in February and March, 1960, advised
a committee of CP members during those months commenced organi-
zation of the WCC with authorized capital of $2,000 which was.
to sell shares and make other plans for operation of a bookstore
selling "progressive" literature at Seattle. In May and June,
1960, this source reported BURT NELSON, on May 18, 1960, stated
the CP District Literature Commission would concern itself with
the bookstore and other types of literature to be sold. On
May 31, 1960, BURT NELSON suggested October 1, 1960, as the
tentative opening date of the bookstore.
A second source advised on November 2, 1960, the
`principal aim of the WCC is to establish a bookstore in the
Seattle area inasmuch as this need has long been recognized by
the Washington State CP due to difficulties encountered in main-
taining a Party literature apparatus, and it is desired to have
available public facilities to attract supporters and sympathizers.
This source stated the WCC has obtained a location for its
bookstore at 710 Stewart Street, Seattle, and operations
commenced at that location on November 5, 1960.
A third source advised on May 1, 1967, that the WCC
held its annual meeting of shareholders at the Roosevelt Hotel,
Seattle, on April 30, 1967. As a part of the business at this
meeting, a report was made on the financial status of "Co-op
Books", 710 Stewart Street, Seattle, for the preceding year.

APPENDIX
SEATTII MONIN ACT FOR PEACE (SWAP)
A source reported on May 17, 1962, a meeting of the
Ballard-Greenwood CP Club was held in Seattle, April 25, 1962,
at which TAIMI HALONEN was nominated to be the new Chairman of
this Club. Along with other business of the evening, HALONEN
said she expected to devote a good portion of her time to SWAP,
an organization of peace forces that met recently with seven
members. She said four of the seven were from the "left" but
did not go into detail. She said the group had problems of an
organizational nature because it was new, and she thought she
could help.
On April 5, 1963, a second source stated a meeting of
the University CP Club was held at Seattle on April 2, 1963.
KEN ROSE, a member of the Club, reported the most influential
peace organization in Seattle was SWAP.
On July 31, 1964, a meeting of the North Central CP
Section Committee was held at Seattle. WILL PARRY, Section
Chairman, said attention should be placed on three political
questions peace, civil rights, and labor. Under peace, he
said CP clubs should inject the Women Act for Peace campaign
into the election campaign. At another Section meeting,
February 5, 1966, TAIMI HALONEN was praised for effective
peace work and for her help in developing unity among the peace
forces. Section-wide concentration was urged in assisting
SWAP to visit 1,000 workers on the Vietnam issue.
A third source advised on February 24, 1966, a
Northwest District CP Committee meeting was held at Seattle
February 12, 1966. After lunch, the entire group participated
in passing out leaflets pertaining to racial matters and the
Vietnam war which carried the name of SWAP, 5411 Ravenna Avenue
Northeast, Seattle, Washington 98105, which address has been
used consistently by SWAP and is that of ANCI KOPPEL, also known
as Mrs. CHARLES KOPPEL. KOPPEL has been and continues to be
the coordinator and apparent prime motivating force of SWAP
as of May, 1967.
A fourth source reported in 1945
ANCI KOPPEL was a member of the
Professional Group of the Communist
Political Association (CPA), also
known as the Rogers CP Club at
Seattle, Washington.
The CPA has been designated by the
Attorney General of the United States

On January 19, 1968, a source, who has furnished
reliable information in the past, furnished the following
information:
On January 15, 1968, a group of approximately 175
women gathered at the Pennsylvania Railroad 30th Street
Station in Philadelphia, Pa. They boarded three special
coaches on the 8:10 a.m. train for Washington, D.C. The
group was the Philadelphia Contingent of the Jeannette Rankin PA, D.C
Brigade which was going to petition the Congress of the
United States against the War in Vietnam.
The train arrived at Washington, D.C., at about
10:45 a.m. The group remained at Union Station, Washington,
D.C., for about an hour waiting for women arriving at the
station from other points, so that the march could begin.
When all were assembled, the group marched in orderly
fashion to Union Square near the Capitol. Prior to the march
it was announced that a small group of women would present
their petition to Congress, while VIVECA LINDFORS would D.C..
read the petition to the assembled group of women at Union
Square.
At Union Square, a girl folk singer entertained
and there was a brief period of silence for those killed in
Vietnam. There appeared to be about 5,000 women assembled

only individual with any known subversive background deter-

on November 17, 1967, on receipt of information from SF 1773-S
that an organization known as the Jeannette Rankin Brigade had
sent out a call for a demonstration to be held at the White
House, Washington, D. C., on January 8, 1968, in protest of
the war in Vietnam. As noted in referenced San Francisco
communication, the above efforts culminated in a demonstration
at Sar. Francisco, California, on January 15, 1968, and a companion
demonstration held in Washington, D. C., on January 15, 1968.
A review of the San Francisco files in the above matter
reflects that NIKKI BRIDGES, San Francisco Chairman of the Brigade
was on March 2, 1987, listed as a recipient of a new yearly sub-
scription to the "People's' World" (PW), expiration date March 4,
1968. There is no known Communist Party (CP) membership on the
part of BRIDGES. VIVIAN HALLINAN, Executive Secretary of the
Brigade, is the only other individual noted as an officer of
the Brigade according to San Francisco files. San Francisco
files do not reflect any known CP membership on the part of
HALLINAN.

WORKERS WORLD PARTY
On April 17, 1959, a confidential source advised
that on February 12, 1959, a Socialist Workers Party (SWP)
minority group under the leadership of National Committee
member SAM BALLAN, split from the SWP.
The source stated that this minority group,
referred to as the Marcyites, after many years of program
and policy differences on varied issues concerning tactics
and interpretation of political events, split from the SWP
on the grounds that the Party was liquidating itself by
departing from the Marxist precepts of LEON TROTSKY and
retreating from the fight for the world socialist
revolution. The final issue which ultimately forced the
split was the minority's opposition to the SWP regroupment
policy which involved cooperation with the Communist Party.
(CP) periphery-individuals characterized by the minority
as petty-bourgeois.
The minority program, according to the source,
advocated unconditional defense of the Soviet Union and has
as its goal the building of a revolutionary party with a
complete proletarian orientation for the purpose of overthrowing
capitalism in the United States and throughout the world.
On May 12, 1960, source advised that this minority
group had chosen the name Workers World Party.
On May 1, 1967, a second confidential source
advised that the Workers World Party, which maintains head-
quarters at 46 West 21st Street, New York, New York, supports
the People's Republic of China in its ideological dispute
with the Soviet Union.
The SWP and CP have been designated
pursuant to Executive Order 10450.

On January 31, 1968, at a meeting of the Marin
County Chapter of the Women's International League For
Peace and Freedom (WILPF), SF 2955-S advised that during
a general discussion concerning the Brigade, it was felt.
that the group did not want the Brigade to become another
formalized group, but rather keep the Brigade as a loose
organization, and as an umbrella group for the WILPF,
San Francisco files in addition reflect that
there has not been at any time a known group of members
of the Brigade%3B rather the organization has been sponsored
by women on both a local and national level, many of whom
are members of varied women's peace groups.
ŋ
In view of the above information, indicating a lack
of specific membership and future activity, no further inves-
tigation is being conducted by the San Francisco Office under
the Jeannette Rankin Digade caption at the present time, UACB.
This matter will be closely followed and should any
future information received by the San Francisco Office apar
to warrant additional investigation, this matter will be reopened.

* RobertFRONNER
As detailed in recommunications, the January demon-
stration was a function of the Jeannette Rankin Brigade, self-
described in its literature as a broad coalition of women from
many areas of American life. Chicago headquarters of the
Brigade was given as c/o GEORGINA GRONNER, 520 North Michigan
Avenue, Chicago. In developing information regarding the
January activity, it was determined that the Chicago coordina-
ting committee was composed of LUCILLE MONTGOMERY, MARJORIE
KINSELLA, CAROL TRAVIS and ROSALIND DURHAM, with travel
arrangements being made by SILVIA KUSHNER.
LUCILLE MONTGOMERY was chairman of the host committee
of the convention of the National Conference for New Politics (NCNE
in September, 1967.
CAROL TRAVIS, who was secretary of a steering committee
which arranged for the NCNP convention, attended a meeting of a
Communist Party (CP) of Illinois Club held in Chicago February
14, 1968, according to CG 6344-S. Investigation concerning
TRAVIS is pending.
KINSELLA, DURHAM and KUSHNER are known CP members. No
subversive information concerning MONTGOMERY is identifiable in
: Chicago indices.
Captioned case was initiated to determine the extent
of activity and degree of communist influence in the organization
in the Chicago area.
On January 12, 1968, Sergeant BURTON LOVELY Intelli-
gence Division, Chicago PD, identified GEORGINA GRONNER as the
wife of Dr. ROBERT GRONNER, MD. 3162 North Pine Grove Avenue,
with offices at 670 North Michigan Avenue, Chicago

Mrs. ROBERT GRONNER was shown as a member of a seventh
anniversary dinner committee of the Chicago Area Committee for a
Sane Nuclear Policy held at Chicago October 15, 1964, on an
invitation furnished by CG 6508-5) September 23, 1964. No
other information in Chicago files. ROBERT GRONNER appears to
be identical with Chicago file 140-2299 as attending physician
(1957) Veterans Administration Research Laboratory, VA, Chicago,
Illinois, SGE, on basis that he spoke at a 1952 meeting sponsored
by the Chicago Council of Arts, Sciences and Professions.
On February 1, 1968, Detective ROBERT BOCK, Intelligence
Division, Chicago PD, advised that LUCILLE MONTGOMERY was the
motivating force and almost solely responsible for organizing
for the Brigade in Chicago. She was assisted as needed by the
individuals listed above in arranging for participation in the
January activity and held several meetings at her apartment in
that regard.
On April 18, 1968, Sergeant LOVELY and Detective BOCK
advised that all information which had been developed by that
agency regarding the Brigade was concerned directly with the
January march on Washington and the supporting local demonstration
in Chicago January 15, 1968. They had no knowledge that any
meetings or other activities have boen hold subsequent to that
time and were of the opinion that the organization as a continuing
affair did not "get off the ground" in Chicago.
Information concerning the January demonstrations was
received at that time from numerous Chicago informants. These
and others in a position to learn of any subsequent activity were
alerted through frequent contacts and have advised they have no
knowledge of continuance of the Brigade as an active organization.
These informants, along with the dates of most recent contact in
this regard, are identified as follows:

"Grant's Tomb" a community newspaper, upper west
side, New York City (NYC), March, 1971, Number 2 Issue, page
10, contained an article captioned, "Women March on
Washington" This article reflected, in part, as follows:
"Out of the outrage against the war that was the unifying
force of the Ann Arbor conference, the women's caucus decided
to channel our frustration into a public statement calling for
a women's march on Washington, D.C. on April 10. We all felt
the urgency to show how we as women feel oppressed by the same
U.S. system that needs the dominance of men over women, white
over black, brown and, yellow, heterosexual over homosexual, and
over poor to support the aggressive war policy that is killing
our Vietnamese sisters and brothers.
"We are making this march one step in showing the
world our solidarity as women with all our sisters in Vietnam
who are fighting for their lives. The Committee to Defend the
Right to Live, a South Vietnamese women's organization, has
called for our support.
The confidential source mentioned above on March
15, 1971, furnished information that on March 11, 1971, a
"women's meeting" was held at Washington Square Methodist
Church, 135 West 4th Street, New York, New York (NY).
Approximately 70 people were present. It appears to the source
that the Pentagon action April 10th is being led by the same
women, in the Women's Union", who are planning the trip to
Toronto, Canada in late March, 1971. The only decision arrived
at during the meeting, according to the source, was that on
the scheduled date, April 10th, there will be a march on the
Pentagon.

"Our sisters in Vietnam have stretched forth a hand
They are our example. We answer them with our strength

Women's National March

Reference is made to New York memorandum
dated March 16, 1971.
On March 24, 1971, a source, who has furnished
reliable information in the past, advised that on March 22,
1971, a "Committee for April 10" held a meeting at the Law
Commune Office, 640 Broadway, New York City (NYC), which
was attended by 30 to 40 females. It was learned that a
woman from the New York (NY) group was already in Washington,
D.C. working with others there to arrange permits, speakers,
et cetera, for the women's march on the Pentagon on April 10,
1971. It was stated that it was easier to obtain a permit
for a march from the Justice Department to the Pentagon,
than from the Pentagon to the Justice Department, but that
no permit had been obtained as yet. It was pointed out that
a march from the Pentagon to the Justice Department was
preferred as there would be less chance of losing marchers
en route to the Justice Department than from marching
from the Justice Department to the Pentagon.
It was stated
that no buses had been chartered at NY, but it was hoped that
15 buses would be needed.

Women's National March
CONFIDENTIAL
on the Pentagon, April 10, 1971
Law Commune
On September 16, 1969, a second source, who
has furnished reliable information in the
past, advised that the Law Commune is not an
organization in the usual sense of the word.
It is rather a law firm comprised of a group
of lawyers interested and sympathetic to the
New Left and Black Power organizations, and who
counsel and defend individuals in these groups
as the occasion arises. They likewise permit
their premises to be used on occasion as a meeting
place for these organizations and distribute
some of their literature.
On March 25, 1971, the second advised that as of
now there is much confusion over the mechanical aspects of
the Women's National March on April 10, 1971, and that the
people in Washington, D.C. will make the ultimate decision
regarding the route of the march. The source stated that
in NY, information concerning buses for washington, D.C.
will be available at the Upper West Side Women's Center,
627 Amsterdam Avenue, NYC, telephone number 874-6696.
On March 24, 1971, the second source made available
a piece of literature sent out by the "April 10 Women's
Committee" concerning the national women's march on the
Pentagon on April 10. This literature contained in part as
follows:
"We are going to the Pentagon on April 10 to
serve notice on our enemies that women are moving against
them. Our urgency and our fury at the expansion of the
Indochinese war and our rage at the repression of our black
and brown sisters and brothers needs expression right now.
We are joining with other women to struggle for the everyday
things we need and against whatever and whoever prevents us
from getting them.
"We need and want our sisters around the country
to build for this action in their own ways, and to communicate
with other sisters their ideas, suggestions and criticisms.
This is a temporary contact list which came out of the Ann
Arbor Conference:

SEATTLE WOMEN ACT FOR PEACE (SWAP)
A source reported on May 17, 1962, a meeting of the
Ballard-Greenwood CP Club was held in Seattle, April 25, 1962,
at which TAIMI HALONEN was nominated to be the new Chairman of
this Club. Along with other business of the evening, HALONEN
said she expected to devote a good portion of her time to SWAP,
an organization of peace forces that met recently with seven
members. She said four of the seven were from the "left" but
did not go into detail. She said the group had problems of an
organizational nature because it was new, and she thought she
could help.
On April 5, 1963, a second source stated a meeting of
the University CP Club was held at Seattle on April 2, 1963.
KEN ROSE, a member of the Club, reported the most influential
peace organization in Seattle was SWAP.
On July 31, 1964, a meeting of the North Central CP
Section Committee was held at Seattle. WILL PARRY, Section
Chairman, said attention should be placed on three political
questions - peace, civil rights, and labor. Under peace, he
said CP clubs should inject the Women Act for Peace campaign
into the election campaign. At another Section meeting,
February 5, 1966, TAIMI HALONEN was praised for effective
peace work and for her help in developing unity among the peace
forces. Section-wide concentration was urged in assisting
SWAP to visit 1,000 workers on the Vietnam issue.
A third source advised on February 24, 1966, a
Northwest District CP Committee meeting was held at Seattle
February 12, 1966. After lunch, the entire group participated
in passing out leaflets pertaining to racial matters and the
Vietnam war which carried the name of SWAP, 5411 Ravenna Avenue
Northeast, Seattle, Washington 98105, which address has been
used consistently by SWAP and is that of ANCI KOPPEL, also known
as Mrs. CHARLES KOPPEL. KOPPEL has been and continues to be
the coordinator and apparent prime motivating force of SWAP
as of May, 1967.
:
A fourth. source reported in 1945
ANCI KOPPEL was a member of the
Professional Group of the Communist
Political Association (CPA), also
known as the Rogers CP Club at:
Seattle, Washington.
The CPA has been designated by the
Attorney General of the United States
NW 88321 Docld:32989544 Pursuant to Executive Order 10450.

Women's National March
on the Pentagon, April 10, 1971
Reference is made to New York (NY) memorandum
dated March 26, 1971.
On March 30, 1971, a source, who has furnished
reliable information in the past, advised that on March
26, 1971, a "Committee for April 10" held a meeting at
the McIntosh Student Union, Barnard College, New York City
(NYC), to plan and organize for the Women's March on the
Pentagon on April 10, 1971. The meeting was attended by
30 individuals and had no chairman.
The source stated that at the above meeting, two
representatives, man and wife, from an "Action Committee"
on certain islands near Okinawa, planned a march on April
10, 1971 in Washington, D.C. to protest giving over to
Japan what they feel to be Chinese islands. This march is
to begin at 1:00 p.m. at the Washington Monument, up
Massachusetts Avenue to the State Department, and possibly
on to the Japanese Embassy. Support of the women's group
was requested%3B however, after the two left the meeting, the
"Committee for April 10" decided not to support the Chinese
march on the grounds that they were too "liberal.

Women's National March on
the Pentagon, April 10, 1971
The source advised that at the above meeting, it
was stated that no permit had been obtained as yet for the
Women's March on the Pentagon on April 10, 1971.
It was
stated that the march will proceed from a "grassy spot" at the
Justice Department at noon, past the Bureau of Indian Affairs,
Department of the Interior, Department of Labor and on to
the Pentagon. An hour at each end of the march would be
allowed for speakers, though the group doubted they would use
it. Guerrilla theatre activity by participating groups in
front of the various government buildings was discussed and
encouraged, though specifics were not mentioned.
The source stated that at the above meeting, copies
of a letter to Madame Binh, head of the Vietcong delegation
to the Paris peace talks and the North Vietnamese in Paris,
were passed out, describing the purpose of the April 10 march.
This letter is set forth as follows:
"March 25, 1971
"Dear Mme. Binh,
"On April 10, many of us American women will be
marching on the Pentagon. You know already of the other
actions being planned here against the war. As women, we
are coming out from separate cities and roles, trying to
create reality out of what we once held looked up in our
imaginations. In marching on the Pentagon, we are joining with
all people inside and outside of Amerika, who fight against
Amerika's attempt to control us.
"We've been conditioned so long to accept Amerika's
definition of us as weak, passive, and powerless, and to deny
all our feelings of love and strength, that it has been a
struggle for us to turn towards each other and fight for our
freedom.
"Your own long struggle in Indochina, and the struggle
of Third World people here at home, awakened us to the
destruction that Amerikan power represents all over the world.
Your many victories against that power have been an inspiration
to us.
But it wasn't until we joined together to examine and
share our own experiences as women in Amerika that we saw

STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY
Students for a Democratic Society, commonly
known as SDS, came into existence at a founding convention
held during June, 1962, at Port Huron, Michigan. From an
initial posture of "participatory democracy, Marxist-
Leninist ideology of various shadings became predominant
during 1968-1969 with debate centering on how best to create
a revolutionary youth movement. SDS moved from involvement
in the civil rights struggle to an anti-Vietnam war position
to advocacy of a militant anti-imperialist line linking up
the oppressed peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America
with the black liberation movement in the United States.
All major factions within SDS embrace Marxism-Lenism
and identify internationally with China, Cuba and North
Vietnam as countries leading the worldwide struggles
against the United States. However, the Soviet Union
was regarded as imperialist and with the Communist Party,
United States of America, "r. visionist" in nature.
SDS operated under a national constitution which
called for an annual Nationa Convention (NC) and quarterly
National Council meetings wherein programs were initiated
and debated. Three national officers were elected annually'
with a National Interim Committee to run the organization.
Regional offices and college chapters elected delegates to
the national meetings but each functioned independently on
local matters. Its official publication "Fire" (formerly
"New Left Notes") last appeared in December, 1969.
Internal factionalism of serious proportions
developed during 1968 - 1969 and the following three factions
evolved as a result of a split at the June, 1969, NC:
Weatherman, Worker Student Alliance (WSA), and Revolutionary
Youth Movement (RYM). The effect of the split on SDS chapters
throughout the country was divisive. Some aligned with one
or the other of the three major factions. Others, unable to
identify with any faction, disassociated with SDS completely
and changed names.
The SDS national office in recent years was
located at 1608 West Madison Street, Chicago, Illinois.

WORKER STUDENT ALLIANCE/
PROGRESSIVE LABOR PARTY
A source advised during August, 1969, that at
the National Convention (NC) of Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS) held in Chicago, Illinois, during June, 1969,
a split arose between the Progressive Labor Party (PLP) and
the National Office (NO), the N) becoming known as the
Weatherman faction. The PLP faction drew the largest
support among those in attendance at the NC.
Source further advised that during late Summer,
1969, the PLP faction of SDS established its National
Headquarters (NH) on the second floor of a loft-type
building at 173A Massachusetts Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts.
The campaign on which the PLP faction centered was to build
a worker student alliance or a campus worker student
alliance. Thus, they adopted the names of Worker Student
Alliance (WSA) or Campus Worker Student Alliance.
Source stated that the "New Left Notes," printed
in New York City, is the official publication of the WSA.
faction.
A second source advised during January, 1970,
that within the SDS, the WSA is a caucus of which the PLP
constitutes the leadership.
A third source advise during July, 1970, that
during demonstrations staged in the Boston area during the
Spring and Summer of 1970 by the NH, the main theme of
previous demonstrations staged by the NH shifted from
protestations of the Vietnam War and other United States
foreign policy matters to attaccing domestic issues such
as racism and unemployment and demonstrating support of
the "workers' struggle.'
Characterizations of the SDS
and PLP are set out separately.

REVOLUTIONARY YOUTH MOVEMENT
A source advised that the Revolutionary Youth
Movement II (RYMII) faction of Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS) held a national conference at Atlanta, Georgia,
from November 26 to 30, 1969. At this conference it was
decided to form a new organization to be known as Revolutionary
Youth Movement (RYM), characterized as a mass anti-imperialist
youth organization, said organization being proposed as
separate and distinct in form and content from SDS. The
"Principles of Unity" adopted by the conference included a
struggle against white supremacy and male supremacy; fights
against imperialism, anticommunism, fascism and oppression
of youth; and support of the right of self-determination of
all "oppressed nations," also support of the right of all
"oppressed and exploited" peoples "to armed self-defense.'
It was agreed that RYM would not be a Marxist-Leninist
organization; however, source said this was decided in order
to indicate an organization broad enough in form to be
acceptable to everyone. A temporary National Steering
Committee (NSC) made up of eight females and two males was
elected to govern RYM until national officers could be
elected during the Spring of 1970.
#1
RYM publications have listed the RYM National Office
(NO) at Post Office Box 5421 and Post Office Box 77012 c,
both Atlanta, Georgia, and a second source has advised that
the NO has no office space but would probably be considered as
located at Apartment 27, 1067 Alta Avenue, Northeast, Atlanta.
Second source advised that women dominated the
founding conference and have continued to dominate NSC
meetings to the point that "women's liberation" has apparently
become the RYM's principal issue also that RYM's poor
-
financial condition has resulted in its failure to publish
a paper. During early 1970, RYM has decided to cater to
the working class rather than youth, since the potential for
social revolution lies in workers.
A third source has stated that it was decided at
the March, 1970, NSC meeting that RYM women had decided the
organization will be molded into a "working class, Marxist-
Leninist, revolutionary, anti-imperialist, problack
nationalist, people's women's liberation organization."
A characterization of the SDS
is set out separately.

APPENDIX
IF
Initially called the "Action Faction," Weatherman
came into being immediately before the June, 1969, Students
for a Democratic Society (SDS) National Convention (NC).
At this NC Weatherman won all three national officer positions
and a majority of the National Interim Committee as well.
Subsequently, they took over the SDS National Office (NO)
in Chicago, and controlled its funds, paper and national
records. Although internal struggle existed until late 1969,
Weatherman for all major purposes controlled SDS nationally
from June, 1969, until its NO closed in February, 1970.
this time it no longer considered itself part of SDS.
At
The term Weatherman emerged from an ideological
paper prepared by its leaders entitled "You Don't Need a
Weatherman to Know Which Way the Wind Blows" ("New Left
Notes" June 18, 1969). This statement outlined the basic
stance of Weatherman: Marxist-Leninist in content but with
strong advocacy that action not theory would bring about
revolution in the United States. This posture was complemented
with an international identification to the Cuban revolution
and CASTRO's statement that the duty of a revolutionary is
to make revolution.
During October, 1969, Weatherman riots in
Chicago resulted in more than 260 arrests for mob action
and related charges. A program of armed struggle was
finalized during a December, 1969, "War Council" wherein
terrorist tactics and political assassination were
contemplated. The basic strength of Weatherman was then
revealed to be some 300 - 350 nationally and geographically
apportioned to the Midwest, New York, and some Northwest.
-
As its rhetoric of violence escalated, Weatherman
leaders increasingly discussed the necessity of an underground
operation wherein more than 90 percent of the organization
would be submerged; "affinity groups" of three five members
would function independently. In February, 1970, Weatherman
leaders announced a program of "strategic sabotage" with
police and military installations as primary targets.
In February, 1970, Weatherman abandoned the
SDS NO, 1608 West Madison Street, Chicago, Illinois, and
throughout the country entered an underground status.

PROGRESSIVE LABOR PARTY
The "New York Times" city edition Tuesday,
April 20, 1965, Page 27, reported that a new party of
"revolutionary socialism" was formally founded on April 18,
1965, under the name of the Progressive Labor Party (PLP),
which had been known as the Progressive Labor Movement.
According to the article, "The Progressive Labor
Movement was founded in 1962, by MILTON ROSEN and MORTIMER
SCHEER after they were expelled from the Communist Party of
the United States for assertedly following the Chinese
Communist line."
A source advised on June 3, 1968, that the PLP
held its Second National Convention in New York City, May 31,
to June 2, 1968, at which time the PLP reasserted its
objective of the establishment of a militant working class
movement based on Marxism-Leninism.
The source also advised that at the Second National
Convention, MILTON ROSEN was unanimously re-elected National
Chairman of the PLP and LEVI LAUB, FRED JEROME, JARED ISRAEL,
WILLIAM EPTON, JACOB ROSEN, JEFFREY GORDON and WALTER LINDER
were elected as the National Committee to lead the PLP until
the next convention.
The PLP publishes "Progressive Labor," a bimonthly
magazine, and "Challenge-Desafio," a monthly newspaper.
Source advised on May 25, 1970, that the PLP
utilizes an address of General Post Office Box 808, Brooklyn,
New York, and also utilizes an office in Room 617, 1 Union
Square West, New York, New York.

DEMONSTRATION BY
JEANNETTE RANKIN BRIGADE
ON JANUARY 8, 1967
IN
WASHINGTON, D. C.
Inspector Thomas I. Herlihy, Intelligence
Division, Metropolitan Police Department, Washington,
D.C., advised on November 28, 1967, that he had received
information from an official of the Pennsylvania Rail-
road to the effect that two Pennsylvania Railroad trains
had been reserved for travel from New York City to
Washington, D.C., on January 8, 1968. Inspector Herlihy
advised that these trains had been reserved by the
"Jeannette Rankin Brigade" in New York City, but no
further details were available concerning the possible
use of the trains.
A confidential source, who has furnished
reliable information in the past, advised on November 28,
1967, that a Jeannette Rankin Brigade is being formed in
various cities of the United States by members of Women

According to information received from the Washington Field
Office and Domestic Intelligence Division, the "April Tenth Women's Committee"
of New York City, a recently formed group of women's protest organizations,
plans a "March on the Pentagon" on Saturday, 4/10/71, as an anti-war protest.
Plans call for the protesters, who may number as many as 5,000, to assemble
at L'Enfant Square, Constitution Avenue, between Seventh and Ninth Streets,
Northwest, between 11:00 a. m. and noon, and thereafter march to the Pentagon
via Constitution Avenue and Memorial Bridge. The demonstration is scheduled.
to end around 5:00 p.m. The Committee has reportedly chartered 14 busses
capable of carrying 630 passengers from New York City to Washington. The
busses are scheduled to unload at the Justice Building, where it is reported the
women will demonstrate. It is noted that L'Enfant Square, the assembly point
for the demonstrators, is within one block of the Justice Building. The protesters
are then scheduled to march to the Pentagon, where they will hold another
demonstration and will be picked up by the busses at the Pentagon.
General Services Administration (GSA) and Department security
officials are cognizant and plan to reinforce the guard force at the Tenth Street
Auto Entrance, which is the only Justice Building entrance open on Saturday.
Since we do not conduct tours on Saturday, no adjustment in our tours is neces-
sary.

numbers of women protested the war and were arrested, it.
would bring the war machine to a halt in this country.

scene of these demonstrations.

of the receipt of information that an organization known as
the Jeannette Rankin Brigade has sent out a call for a
demonstration to be held at the White House, Washington, D. C.,
on 1/8/68 in protest of the war in Vietnam,
For your information, Jeannette Rankin, the Chairman

Georgia, who served in the House of Representatives as a

Rankin has repeatedly opposed U.S. involvement in
foreign wars and has voted against declarations of war by

the Vietnam war, she has stated, "Ten thousand women have
sat back and let their sons be killed in Vietnam.
If we

stop the war in Vietnam. You cannot have wars without
women." She has stated that she is willing to stay in jail
until the bombing in Vietnam is stopped. .

On March 31, 1971, CV T 3, who has furnished
reliable information in the past, advised that the Women's
March will begin between 11:00 a.m. and 12:00 noon, April
10, 1971, in Washington, D.C., across from the Department
of Justice on Constitution Avenue, and will then proceed

some 3 to 10,000 persons are expected to participate in the

On April 5, 1971, CV T-1 stated that it had been
learned that approximately 12 buses will make the travel
from New York City to Washington, D.C. for the Women's March
although it was not known if the buses would be full, and
a number of other buses would go from up-state New York.
Source further stated that part of the Women's March in
Washington, D.C., would consist of reading poems, singing,
and going from building to building playing instruments.
On April 6, 1971, CV T-3 advised that the Women's
group at the University of Ohio, Athens, Ohio, was having
trouble obtaining transportation to the Women's March in
Washington, D.C. since they did not have enough people to
fill a bus.
On April 9, 1971, CV T-1 stated that at 12:00 noon,
April 9, 1971, there would be a meeting in Washington, D.C.

Source stated that KURSHAN has printed approximately
1,000 leaflets concerning the Women's March. It was learned
that the women from Ann Arbor did not care for the idea of
a Women's March on the Pentagon but the New York Women
overruled the objection since they appealed to the May Day
Coalition to do all the work such as obtain housing for the
people.

be a meeting Thursday night, (April 1, 1971) in Kent, Ohio,

RE:
DEMONSTRÁTION PROTESTING UNITED STATES
POLICY IN VIETNAM, WASHINGTON, D. C.,
JANUARY 8, 1968
The Secretary of the Brigade has been identified
as Vivian Hallinan, the wife of Vincent Hallinan who in 1966
was identified as the Treasurer for the American Institute
of Marxist Studies, a communist front organization.
One source has described the Brigade as a "one-shot"
organization formed by women in various cities to hold demon-
strations "all over" the U.S. on 1/8/68.
In its call for the above demonstration, Brigade
literature urges participants to enter the U.S. Congress to
present demands for an end to the war.
All offices immediately alert sources concerning
this demonstration. All information developed is to be
immediately reported to the Bureau and Washington Field by
teletype followed by memorandum, original and ten copies,
under the above caption for dissemination to all interested
agencies. Teletypes must contain sufficient identifying
data to enable the Bureau to characterize organizations and
individuals supporting the demonstration without resorting
to file reviews. Such statements as "a Security Index
subject" or "subject of a Bureau investigation" should not
be used. The Bureau is not to be referred to its files for
identifying information.
It is essential that all individuals with subversive
backgrounds and subversive organizations participating in
this demonstration be identified.
Informant coverage of groups that plan to support
the Brigade and to participate in the demonstration is to
be arranged. It is imperative that the Bureau be able to
pinpoint subversive organizations and individuals partici-
pating in the demonstration.
Each office is to make particular effort to
develop information regarding the financial backing of
individuals and groups that may participate in the demon-
stration.

WFO is conducting individual investigations regarding
the staff members to determine if their activities would
warrant their inclusion on the ADEX.
For information of the Bureau,
INFORMANT
who is in a position to furnish limited information re-
garding the residents of 219 11th St., S.E., has furnished
information on numerous occasions regarding vehicles which
have been parked in front of or near the "Furies" residence.
Source has observed occupants of these vehicles enter the
residence at 219 11th St., S.E.. Leads have been set out
in referenced communications regarding these vehicles for
identification.
7
On 4/10/72, INFORMANT advised that several months
ago, when several girls moved into the residence at 219 11th
St., S.E., WDC, they were observed carrying what appeared to
be a printing press into the basement of the apartment.
Source advises that several females frequent the
house and one of the girls has a baby. The same source
advised that most of the girls who frequent the address
have extremely short hair and always wear slacks.
For information of the Bureau a review of the
three existing issues of the newspaper indicates that most
of the articles concern the problems that lesbians face,
where they can go socially, and how to be strong and in-
dependent as a lesbian. The newspaper contains very few
advertisements, but all of the ads refer to lesbians.

SUBJECT DEMONSTRATION PROTESTING UNITED STATES
POLICY IN VIETNAM, WASHINGTON, D. C.,
JANUARY 8, 1968.
INFORMATION CONCERNING
(INTERNAL SECURITY)
The San Francisco Office has reported that an
organization known as the Jeannette Rankin Brigade has sent
out a call for women from throughout the Nation to demonstrate
at the White House on 1/8/68. This call also urges partici-
pants to "enter the U.S. Congress" to present demands for an
end to the war.
Jeannette Rankin, who is the Chairman of the
Brigade, is an 86-year-old resident of Watkinsville, Georgia.
She was a Congresswoman from Montana from 1917 to 1919 and
served one term in 1940. She voted against U.S. involvement
in World Wars I and II. Rankin has publicly protested the
war in Vietnam and has asserted her willingness to go to
jail in protest of the bombing.
The Secretary of the Brigade has been identified
as Vivian Hallinan, the wife of Vincent Hallinan who was
identified in 1966 as the Treasurer for the American Institute
of Marxist Studies, a communist front organization.
The above information has been furnished to the
White House, the Department of State, the Attorney General
and military intelligence.
In view of the Bureau's responsibility to identify
subversive elements which may participate in the demonstration
sponsored by this group and to keep the White House and other
agencies advised of developments, it is felt that the field
should be notified of the proposed demonstration and furnished
with instructions for handling information concerning it,
including the need for informant coverage of participating
groups.

al
Boston file 100-38735 entitled "EVAN PATCHEN
DELLINGER, aka PATCH DELLINGER; SM - ANARCHIST (BUFILE
100-450988)" reflected that DELLINGER was subject of
Boston investigation based on his participation in a
"Teach-In" and Rededication Service on 1/29/68 at the
Arlington St. Church, Boston. During the above activity,
DELLINGER made a statement in support of the "Resistance
Group" and turned in what was reported to be Selective
Service cards..
The primary function of the Resistance Group
was to aid, abet, and counsel young men faced with the
draft.
EVAN PATCHEN DELLINGER graduated from Swarthmore
College, Swarthmore, Pa., on 6/6/66 majoring in economics.
He was arrested at Chester, Pa. on 4/1/64 and was charged
with disorderly conduct.
The 1968-69 Harvard University Directory of
Officers and Students reflected that DELLINGER was enrolled
in the School of Medicine, Harvard University, Cambridge,
Mass.
It had been reported that PATCH DELLINGER was
present at a Socialist Workers Party (SWP) Street Meeting
in New York City on 7/21/64.
The file further disclosed that inasmuch as the
Boston office had no current information associating DELLIN-
GER with the SWP or the Young Socialist Alliance and that
his activities on behalf of the New England Resistance were
pacifist in nature, it was felt that DELLINGER did not
warrant inclusion on the Security or Agitator Indexes main-
tained at that time; and thus, the case was placed in a closed
status.

A review of Boston file 25-25585 (Bufile 25-569484)
reflected that DELLINGER was also subject of investigation
based on his participation in the previously mentioned
Rededication Services at the Arlington St. Church in Boston
on 1/29/68 at which 23 individuals turned in either a
Notice of Classification and/or a Registration Certificate.
Two other individuals turned in some other type of document.
It was determined that DELLINGER had turned in a Selective
Service Registration Certificate and two Notices of Classi-
fication issued by LB #28, Flemington, New Jersey. Also,
a two-page statement signed PATCHEN DELLINGER supporting
the Resistance movement was turned in.
In April, 1972, AUSA, Boston declined any prosecu-.
tion concerning DELLINGER.
On 8/21/72, personnel of the Office of the Mass.
Commissioner of Probation, Suffolk County Courthouse, Boston,
a central repository for all traffic and criminal conviction
records within the Commonwealth of Mass., advised that their
files contain no record identifiable with CHARLES WELCH,

lication known as the "Furies" Newspaper was being formed in
Washington, D.C. to espouse the cause of radical lesbianism
and to align itself politically with the views of the "New
Left."

published and distributed during January, 1972, no specific

--- Image 124-10274-10125_page_592.jpeg ---
Whether or not the paper will continue is unknown
at this time.
On December 1, 1972, WF T-9 advised that the
"Furies" stopped publishing their newspaper sometime in
the Fall of 1972.
Source was unable to locate a subsequent issue
after the August, 1972 issue.

On August 23, 1972, this source advised that
apparently four or five young white girls now live at
219 11th Street, S.E. Source has seen numerous different
girls frequenting the residence, but is unsure exactly
how many reside there at the present time.
One girl, name unknown, who resides at the residence,
has stated to source she is a music teacher. Source has
seen several girls on different occasions carrying what
appeared to be newspapers. Source states that all the girls
are generally quiet and keep to themselves.
On September 13, 1972, WF T-5 advised that SUSAN
HATHAWAY, SUSAN SCHWING and COLETTA REID still rent and
apparently reside at 219 11th Street, S.E., Washington, D.C.
Source stated that these three girls continue to
pay their monthly rent promptly and she said that each
of the girls takes turns paying the rent each month.
Source related that when the dwelling was rented to
these three girls, they made a remark that they were employed
by "research organization", name unknown, and did most of
their research at the Library of Congress.
Source stated that she has not been in the dwelling
at 219 11th Street, S.E., since it was rented to these three
girls, but she has received no complaints concerning any of
their activities.
On September 14, 1972, WF T-8 furnished the August, 1972
copy of the "Furies" Newspaper.
A subsequent review of this issue, as well as all
previous issues, did not reflect any radical revolutionary
or anti-government theme. All issues have been devoted to
articles pertaining to lesbian/feminist interests.
On October 12, 1972, WF T-9 advised that an internal
conflict has developed within the "Furies" collective and they
are breaking up into different factions, based on ideological
differents.

Source knew of no radical revolutionary tendencies
or activities being planned or contemplated by any of the
"Furies" members.
On April 10, 1972, WF T-4 advised that several months
ago, when several girls moved into the residence at 219 11th
Street, S.E., Washington, D.C., they were observed carrying
what appeared to be a printing press into the basement of the
apartment.
Source advised that several females frequented the
house and one of the girls has a baby. Source advised that most
of the girls who frequented the address have extremely short
hair and always wear slacks.
On July 13, 1972, WF T-5 advised that three women,
SUSAN HATHAWAY, SUSAN SCHWING, and COLETTA REID originally
rented the house located at 219 11th Street, S.E., Washington,
D.C. Source had no background information on any of these
women and was not aware of anyone else residing at the
residence. Source has received no complaints about the
residence from the neighbors.
On July 7, 1972, WF T-6 advised that the Sojourner
Truth Press in Atlanta, Georgia, was a printing press for
hire, which prints mostly "New Left" material for "New
Left" organizations, yet it espouses no opinions of its own.
As long as their fee is met, they will print what is
desired, i.e. papers, pamphlets, flyers, etc.
On September 11, 1972, WF T-7 advised that the Sojourner
Truth Press had gone out of business on August 15, 1972,
due to a lack of funds. Source also advised that the individuals
connected with the Sojourner Truth Press were planning on
leaving Atlanta.
On September 13, 1972, a telephone call was made to
telephone number 688-6222, the telephone number for the
Sojourner Truth Press, Atlanta, Georgia, and a recorded voice
advised that service for that telephone number had been dis-
continued.
On July 13, 1972, WF T-4 advised that several young
white girls continued to reside at 219 11th Street, S.E.,
Washington, D.C. They appear friendly, but keep very much
to themselves.

Re WFO report of SA JERRY M. GRAVES, 12/13/72, and
WFO letter to Bureau, 1/31/73.
On 3/6/73, INFORMANT advised that for all intents
and purposes the "Furies" organization and collective have
ceased to function. There are no plans to publish another
newspaper, and most of the members have left to pursue their
own interests.
As reported in re WFO report, investigation of this
case did not reflect any activities on the part of the "Furies"
that would be considered revolutionary or subversive:
The "Furies" newspaper ceased publication in August,
1972, and did not espouse a radical revolutionary line.
In view of the above, this case is being closed.
WFO will remain alert for information regarding any possible
future activity on the part of the "Furies", and will report,

This memorandum advises of demonstrations being scheduled in
Washington, D. C., and San Francisco, California, on 11/20/71 to build
public support for the repeal of antiabortion laws.
The Women's National Abortion Action Coalition was formed at a
conference held at Columbia University, New York City, in July, 1971, which
was attended by approximately 1,000 women from 29 states. The conference
voted to make a woman's right to abortion a national and political issue.
Subsequent to its formation, the coalition called for demonstrations in
San Francisco and Washington on 11/20/71 to build public support for the
repeal of all antiabortion laws, to protest forced sterilization, and to call
for an end to restrictive contraceptive laws. A source of the Washington
Field Office has advised that the march in Washington is supported by the
Young Socialist Alliance, the youth group of the Socialist Workers Party
(SWP). Carol Lipman, who is a member of the SWP, is Project Director
of the Washington march.
D.C
Coalition leaders in requesting permit for the demonstration have
¡estimated that participation in the Washington march will range between
(10,000 and 20,000 persons. The Washington Field Office has developed
information that 46 buses have been chartered to bring participants to the
demonstration. Participants will represent some 80 cities. The Metropolitan
Police Department anticipates participation will be in the vicinity of 5,000 persons
EX-1C1 REC-23.
are
Demonstrators are scheduled to assemble at the Ellipse between
10 a. m. and 12 noon and will march via 17th Street to H Street, down H Street
to 15th Street, down 15th Street to Pennsylvania Avenue, and then east on
Pennsylvania Avenue to the west steps of the Capitol. A rally will be held
at the latter site between 2 and 6 p. m.

It is noted that November 20, 1971, is the date
of a publicly announced march and rally by the Woman's
National Abortion Action Coalition culminating in a rally
at 2:00 p.m., on the west steps of the United States
Capitol. In a Washington Post Daily Newspaper article
of October 15, 1971, Dr. Barbara Roberts, National Project
Director of the coalition stated that the march would
attack abortion laws which degraded, mutilated and murdered
women. She stated the coalition was comprised of about.
30 women's groups which would demonstrate against the forced
sterilization and restrictive contraception laws and also
plan to hold national abortion hearings in Washington,
D.C., before the march. Roberts estimated between 10,000
and 20,000 women would engage in this march and rally.
On October 15, 1971, a source who has furnished
reliable information in the past advised that the November
20, 1971, WONAC March is largely the creator of the Young
Socialist Alliance (YSA) Socialist Workers Party (SWP) and
as such has not received the endorsement of more radical.

BRIGADE FORMED TO CONFRONT CONGRESS
Helena, Montana
November 27, 1967
To all American Women:
I am proud of the fact that my first
vote cast in Congress was a vote
against war. It was the first oppor-
unity for a woman to vote, because I
was the first woman to be elected to
Congress.
-
I believed then, as I do today,
that women are the ones that must be
concerned with the needs and develop-
ment of the human race. I have always
fought for the dignity of all human
beings for those of the present as
well as those of future generations.
I will continue to struggle as long
as I live. I hope all women will res-
pond to the following call and join me
in Washington on January 8, 1968, the
opening day of Congress.
Jeannette Rankin
A CALL TO ALL AMERICAN WOMEN who
are outraged by the ruthless slaughter
in Vietnam and the persistent neglect
of human needs at home TO COME TO
WASHINGTON ON JANUARY 8
AMERICAN WOMEN represent 51% of the
voting population of our country.
AMERICAN WOMEN have the power to a-
chieve peace and a decent life for
every American. This is woman power!
Demonstrate it to the Congress of the
United States! Come to Washington on
January 8 as Congress opens in joint
session. Support Jeannette Rankin as
she leads a representative delegation
of American women to the Capitol to
demand that:
*Congress, as its first order
of business, resolve to end
the war in Vietnam and immedi-
ately arrange for the with-
drawal of all American troops.
*Congress use its power to make
reparations for the ravaged land
we leave behind in Vietnam.
*Congress listen to what the
American people are saying and
refuse the insatiable demands of
the military-industrial complex.
WOMEN OF AMERICA, our power is un-
limited. On January 8, American women
will:
*PETITION the United States Con-
gress
*CONVENE a Congress of American
Women that afternoon to develop
programs to meet the crisis in
America
programs which will
express our political power,
reason and conscience.

WOMEN'S NATIONAL ABORTION
ACTION COALTION (WONAAC)
"These grouns, which joined in July (1971)
to form the Women's National Abortion Action
Coalition (WONAAC), are organizing a march
Nov. 20 (1971) in Washington planned to take
them past the White House, the Supreme Court
and the Capitol--institutions which they feel
can effect significant changes in existing
abortion laws. They are expecting what they
call a conservative estimate of between
10,000-20,000 persons, but are hoping for thousands
more,
On November 10, 1971, source one made available the
following leaflet issued by the Los Angeles Women's Abortion
Action Committee (LAWAAC), an affiliate of the WONAAC,
and annoucing a demonstration to be held November 20, 1971,
at San Francisco, California, to protest abortion laws and
forced sterilization and restrictive contraception laws.

WOMEN'S NATIONAL ABORTION
ACTION COALITION (WONAAC)
SPONSORED DEMONSTRATION
November 20, 1971
Washington, D. C.
The WONAAC is self-described in its literature
as being formed by the national conference of
more than 1,000 women held in New York City,
New York, in July 1971. At that conference,
women from 29 states and 253 organizations came
together to unite their efforts in the national
fight for the repeal of all abortion laws and
for the corollary demands of no forced sterilization
and repeal of contraception laws. The conference
called for a massive show of force for these goals
in a march on Washington, D.C., and San Francisco,
California, November 20, 1971. WONAAC is based
on a program of legislative, judicial, and
mass demonstration activities on a local and.
national level, and seeks to unite all women in
the fight for the right of abortion.
The September 22, 1971, issue of the "Los Angeles Times"
a newspaper of general circulation published daily in Los Angeles,
California, contains an article on page ó, part IV, datelined
Washington, D. C., entitled "Abortion March Mobilizing", which
article states in part as follows:
"Women from 253 organizations across the country
are mobilizing for mass demonstrations here
(Washington, D. C.) and in San Francisco in
November to support the complete repeal of all
abortion laws.

BASIC RIGHTS -- THE RIGHT TO CONTROL OUR OWN BODIES; THE RIGHT TO CONTROL OUR OWN
LIVES. RESTRICTIVE ABORTION LAWS PROVIDE THE BASIS OF LEGALIZED MURDER OF THOUSANDS

COANDENDAAL
It was ascertained by means of a suitable pretext by
a representative of the FBI on November 10, 1971, that the
LAWAAC plans to charter a bus from Los Angeles to San Francisco
for Los Angeles individuals interested in participating in the
above November 20, 1971, demonstration in San Francisco. The
bus is scheduled to depart Los Angeles at 10:00 p.m., on
November 19, 1971, and to depart San Francisco after the
demonstration at 10:00 p.m., November 20, 1971. The cost of
a round trip ticket on a bus will be $14.00.

The November 11, 1971, issue of the "UCLA Daily Bruin",
the official campus newspaper of the University of California
at Los Angeles (UCLA), 405 Hilgard Avenue, Los Angeles, contained
an article on page 2 entitled "Symposium Presents Views on
Women's Roles in Society", which article indicated that Dr. Barbara
Roberts was one of a number of speakers at a "teach-in'
symposium on women held at UCLA. According to the article,
Dr. Roberts talks about her work as a volunteer doctor in an
abortion clinic in Washington, D..C. The article indicated
that WONAAC would sponsor simultaneous demonstrations in
San Francisco and Washington, D. C., on November 20, 1971, to
protest abortion laws.
The November 12, 1971, issue of "The Militant"
contained an article on page 5 entitled "Building
for Nov. 20" which article describes Dr. Barbara
Roberts as the National Project Director of WONAAC,
"The Militant" is the weekly newspaper of the
Socialist Workers Party (SWP).
The SWP has been designated by the Attorney
General of the United States pursuant to
Executive Order 10450.
The above November 11, 1971, issue of the "UCLA
Daily Bruin" further indicated that another speaker at the
"teach-in" symposium of women at UCLA was 0-Rodriguez,
described by the article as a member of WONAAC. According

SPONSORED DEMONSTRATION
November 20, 1971
Washington, D. C.
The WONAAC is self-described in its literature
as being formed by the national conference of
more than 1,000 women held in New York City,
New York, in July 1971. At that conference,
women from 29 states and 253 organizations came
together to unite their efforts in the national
fight for the repeal of all abortion laws and
for the corollary demands of no forced sterilization
and repeal of contraception laws. The conference
called for a massive show of force for these goals
in a march on Washington, D. C., and San Francisco,
California, November 20, 1971. WONAAC is based
on a program of legislative, judicial, and
mass demonstration activities on a local and
national level, and seeks to unite all women in
the fight for the right of abortion,
On November 28, 1971, source one advised that on
November 19, 1971, a bus chartered by the Los Angeles Women's
Abortion Action Committee (LAWAAC) transported approximately
fifty Los Angeles, California, area individuals from Los Angeles
to San Francisco to participate in a demonstration held in that
city on November 20, 1971, and sponsored by WONAAC to protest
abortion laws, forced sterilization, and restrictive contraception
laws. This bus left Los Angeles at approximately 10:00 p.m., on
November 19, 1971, and returned to the Los Angeles area during
the evening of November 20, 1971,

"
is based on a program of legislative,
judicial, and mass demonstration
activities on a local and national level,
and seeks to unite all women in the fight
for the right of abortion.
On November 20, 1971, Special Agents of the
San Francisco Office of the Federal Bureau of Investiga-
tion (FBI) observed that approximately five hundred
individuals, primarily young women in their teens and
early twenties, gathered at the Embarcadero, San Francisco,
California, and began marching at 11:10 a.m. from the
Embarcadero, en route to the Civic Center, San Francisco.
They carried signs such as "free our women" and "separate
church and state". By 12:30 p.m., the marchers had
arrived at the Civic Center where a female rock hand was
performing. A rally was held at the Civic Center from
approximately 1:45 p.m. to 3:30 p.m., addressed by indi-
viduals supporting repeal of abortion laws.
There were no incidents or arrests with regard
to the march and rally, according to San Francisco Police
Department records, and the official police estimate of
the crowd attending the rally was approximately eight
hundred individuals.
The Sunday, November 21, 1971, edition of the
"San Francisco Examiner", a San Francisco, California,
daily newspaper, in an article entitled "Pro and' Anti-
Abortion Forces Hold Rallies", described HELEN MEYERS,
one of the speakers at the Civic Center rally, as
Regional Coordinator for WONAAC.

For the Bureau's information a sub-committee has
been formed within the Southern California Council of the
Women Strike for Peace (WSP) to handle present activities to
publicize the JRB. This committee consists of MARY CLARKE
and EVA KORN, who are mentioned in the details of instant
LHM. It also includes TA 4490-S and GERALDINE SHAPIRO (also
known as GERRY (SHAPIRO). The latter, is a relatively new,
member of the WSP having attended some six meetings between
2/7/67 and 10/10/67, and has not been the subject of active
investigation by this office. To further protect EA 4490-S.,
her name and the name of GERALDINE SHAPIRO are not being
included in details of instant LHM, as it is hoped that
suspicion may be directed toward SHAPIRO at a later date to
indicate she might be an informant for some investigating
body.
There has been no attempt to characterize the
listed individuals in the "partial list of sponsors" set
out in the "La Wisp" issue of December 1967, a xerox copy
of which is attached, with the exception of LESLIE PARRISH
and MARY CLARKE (the only local Southern California women).
PARRISH has not been the subject of active investigation
by the Los Angeles Division as she has been reported in

RE: ABORTION PROJECT COALITION
CLEVELAND, CHIO
On December 3, 1971 a second source, reliable,
advised that during a meeting of the Cleveland Young
Socialist Alliance (YSA) on November 21, 1971. Robbie
Scheer stated that about 5,000 women attended the Women's
Liberation March in Washington, D.C. on November 20, 1971,
including a bus of approximately 40 women from Cleveland.
The Clevelana YSA according to source, considered 40 a good
number for the first women's liberation march.
YOUNG SOCIALIST ALLIANCE (YSA)
CLEVELAND, OHIO
The Cleveland branch of the YSA is the
youth group of the SWP in Cleveland..
On December 22, 1971 above source advised that on
December 21, 1971 Robbie Scheer had stated that there were
some intersession classes being held at CWRU, Cleveland, Ohio,
by the APC. These are three classes in Women's Liberation:
one on Abortion, one on Women's Literature, and one in
Psychological Aspects of the Women's Liberation Movement.
On December 22, 1971 a reliable source advised that
about 2,000 - 2,500 persons attended the march and rally for
abortion law reform on November 20, 1971 at Washington, D.C.
of which approximately 80% were female and 20% were male.
Source stated that the march was fairly orderly and source
noted only one minor incident which occurred at a theater
along the route that was showing the movie "The Sex Machine".
There was no destruction and no arrests were made. .
On January 10, 1972 Tony Zemac, University Circle
Police Department, Cleveland, Ohio, advised that his office
had received numerous leaflets and references to the Abortion
Project Coalition, which is located at CWRU, but that his
office did not consider the APC a subversive organization
in its own right. He further advised that to the best of his

On November 30, 1971, an article appeared on page 9
of the "Indiana Daily Student , supra, captioned "Women.
March for Abortion Reform". The article stated that less
than the forty students who had been expected to attend the
demonstration actually attended. The article indicated that
the large number of persons expected to attend the
Washington, D. C., demonstration from all over the country
did not materialize. The article also stated that Student
Body President Mary Scifres, who had had to decline an
invitation by the demonstration sponsors to speak at the
march because of obligations at Indiana University, prepared
a statement to be read. Her statement and several other
statements, however, were not read because of the lack of time
due to frequent breakdown of sound equipment delaying speeches.
According to the article, Paula Savich had expected a better turn-
out from Indiana University.
On January 17, 1972, the second confidential source
mentioned above advised that the BAC was not currently active.
and that it was not expected to be active in the near future
unless other demonstrations such as the demonstration held in
Washington, D. C., on November 20, 1971, called for support
from Indiana University. According to this source, the
BAC had been formed principally by members of the YSA, namely
Paula Savich, who was Chairwoman for the BAC and who currently
heads the women's faction of the YSA at Indiana University.

INFORMATION CONCERNING (INTERNAL SECURITY)
The following information has been made available
by sources who have furnished reliable information in the
past:
Source One reported on December 7, 1967, that copies
of "La Wisp", monthly newsletter of the Southern California
Council of the Women Strike for Peace (WSP - see appendix)
being mailed to the WSP mailing list on that date contained
a "Call" from the Jeannette Rankin Brigade (JRB) "To all
American women", announcing a proposed march on Washington,
D. C., on January 8, 1968, when the United States Congress
opens in joint session. This march would be to demand that
Congress, as its first order of business, resolve to end
the war in Vietnam and immediately arrange for the with-
drawal of all American troops. (A xerox duplication of the
first page of the above-mentioned December 1967 issue of
"La Wisp", containing this "Call", is appended to this
memorandum.)
The partial list of JRB sponsors included in this
issue of the "La Wisp", contained the names of only two
women presently active in the Southern California area,
Mary Clarke (see characterization of her in the appendix
page on WSP.), and motion picture actress Leslie Parrish.
Source One has advised that Parrish has only
recently become interested in activities of WSP and has
attended less than five WSP activities. Source Two reported

On November 13, 1971, a source advised that the
Women's National Abortion Coalition (WONAAC) planned to
hold demonstrations at Washington, D. C. and San Francisco,
California on November 20, 1971. The purpose of the
demonstrations were to call for the repeal of all abortion,
contraception and forced sterilization laws. The Women's
Right to Choose of Maryland, the Baltimore, Maryland
affiliate of WONAAC was to organize busing and housing
arrangements for out-of-state women.
On November 22, 1971, a source advised that the
Women's Right to Choose of Maryland, working from 3028
Greenmout Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland, were unsuccessful
in attempts to generate enthusiasm for the WONNAC demonstration
among Baltimore area women. Therefore, the plan to charter
a bus for the purpose of transporting demonstrators to the
Washington, D. C. rally was cancelled.
On November 30, 1971, a second source advised
that the Women's Right to Choose of Maryland had been
formed as an "ad hoc" group for the specific purpose of
supporting the November 20, 1971 Washington, D. C. demonstra-
tion. The source further stated that the Women's Right
to Choose of Maryland ceased to exist, following this
demonstration, and is now defunct.

According to Source One, the Southern California
Council of WSP is presently coordinating local activity to
form a contingent of the JRB from Southern California. They
are making office space and telephones in their Los Angeles

Rankin Brigade should be made up of only those women who
volunteer to participate with the prior understanding that
they should be ready to spend at least two months in jail
for the commission of civil disobedience while in Washington,
D. C.
Sunderland also suggested that a good way to recruit
women to join the Brigade would be to make a pitch for
recruits when Mary Clarke, Dagmar Wilson and Ruth/Krause
are making their respective speaking engagements across the
United States since their return from a trip to North Vietnam,
which they visited as representatives of WSP during the
fall of 1967.
Source Four advised during the summer of 1965
that June Sunderland, 3730 Hollister Avenue,
Santa Barbara, California, had attended a 1967
"peace conference" in Helsinki, Finland, at the
invitation of the Communist Party (CP), and that
funds to cover her expenses were raised in part
by the CP3 and that following her attendance at
the Helsinki affair she went on to Russia for ten
days at the invitation and expense of the Soviet
Government.
Source One learned that a communication was re-
ceived from eastern sponsors of the JRB on December 7, 1967,
indicating that the JRB march on Washington might not be
held on January 8, 1968, but possibly would be set back until
either the 15th or 22nd of January 1968, depending upon
the date that the United States Congress would reconvene.
The communication indicated that since the entire purpose
of the Brigade would be to confront the opening joint session
of Congress that it would be futile to schedule the march
prior to the date Congress would reconvene. The suggestion
was made that recruitment of local women to participate in
the JRB be held in abeyance until a confirmation had been
obtained indicating the date on which Congress would reconvene.
Source One, had indicated that although the "Call",
as reproduced in "La Wisp", states, "There will be local
actions across the country at the same time as the action
1 in Washington, D. C., that there are no current plans for

general interest and concern to the membership of the TCB-SWP;

women's liberation movement of interest.
MP T-2 on
February 4, 1972
Members of the YSA-TCG have expressed an interest in
women's liberation as a matter of policy. The anti-abortion
movement is one aspect of women's liberation of concern to
female members of the YSA-TCG. The vast majority of women
in the state of Minnesota support either the repeal or changes
in present state laws on abortion. Members and sponsors of
MWAAC include professional women, modical doctors, lawyers,
municipal court judges, and others from all walks of life.
MP T-1 on
January 26, 1972
Individuals active in the women's liberation movement
in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota, of
responsible leadership positions within the community, have
recognized the sympathies of individuals such as Mary Hillery
and consider her to be a representative of the rauical left.
As a result, Mary Hillery is considered to have little or no
influence in the women's liberation movement in this area.

Re:
Women's National Abortion Action
Coalition (WONAAC) Convention,
February 11 - 13, 1972
Boston, Massachusetts
On February 18, 1972, source, who has furnished
reliable information in the past, furnished the following
information;
A Women's National Abortion Action Coalition
(WONAAC) Convention was held on the Boston University campus,
Boston, Massachusetts, during the period of February 11
13, 1972.
Approximately 1,000 persons were in attendance
at this convention which was held to determine future action
of WONAAC and to allow diverse factions within the Women's
Abortion Movement to join ranks under one issue.
Female members of the Socialist Workers Party (SHP)
and Young Socialist Alliance (YSA) from all over the county
were requested by the national office of the SWP and YSA
to attend this convention in order to insure the effective
control of the convention by the SWP.
As the youth organization of the Socialist
Workers Party (SNP), the Young Socialist Alliance
(YSA) serves as the main source of recruitment
into that organization. The YSA is described
in the masthead of its official publication,
"The Young Socialist Organizer," as "A multi-
national revolutionary socialist youth organi-
zation,"
The SWP has been designated pursuant to
Executive Order 10450.

Re: WONAAC

CONFIDENTIAL
The SWP specifically wished the convention to
adopt a one-issue position, that being the complete
control of the female body by the individual female.
This specific issue, "women control their bodies" was
adopted by the women's organization and all other propo-
sals were rejected.
Workshops were organized for each of the many
separate racial and ethnic groups represented at the
conference. Workshops were based on appeal to the speci-
fic group intended and all were supposedly controlled by
the SWP.
A Black, Raza, Asian-American women's workshop
was held on February 12, 1972, with 35 persons attending.
Among the issues discussed at the workshop were the
attempts of democratic and republican presidential candi-
dates to capitalize on minority group attitudes in regard
to the abortion movement and the fact that minority groups
all to often find themselves without a voice when real
issues are involved.
Of particular importance to the group was the
La Raza Unida Party, a legitimate political party in Texas
which serves to unite Mexican Americans. Of equal impor-
tance was the Gay Liberation Movement, which the group
felt expresses the plight of gay females who do not want
children and are forced to live with men because of the
mores of American society.
-
Attendees agreed that the one issue of abortion
law.repeal will serve to unite. women under one banner and
more effectively serve the Women's Movement.
The convention adjourned after an agreement that
an "Abortion Action Week" would be held May 1 - 6, 1972.
This action would serve to keep public attention focused
on the need to legalize abortion and to seek effective
support from the many thousands of women who want to right
to choose.

Jeannette Rankin Speaks Up
War's Unremitting Foe
Atlanta, Ga.
Jeannette Rankin, the
only member of Congress
to oppose this country's
entry into both World
Wars, says the nation's
women should band to-
gether to halt the war in
Vietnam.
"If we had 10,000 wome
willing to go to prison if nec
essary, that would end it.
You cannot have wars with-
out the women,” she says.
Miss Rankin, the first
woman ever to serve in the
House of Representatives,
said in an interview: "We've
had 10,000 women sit back
and let their sons be killed in
Vietnam. To me, that is
worse than the old Hebre
sacrifices."

2. Second WONAAC Conference was held in Boston,
Massachusetts, February 11-13, 1972. Approximately 1,300
women attended the conference, which once again re-established
and reiterated WONAAC's call for abortion on demand.
noted during the conference that WONAAC had been unable to
create anything like a national campaign and that local meetings
across the country had been disappointingly small.
It was
pointed out that WONAAC had failed to attract the large numbers
of working women, housewives, and students concerned with the
abortion issue, including the majority of women's liberationists
and abortion reform activists. It was felt that the movement
could not succeed without the support of the working women.
At the close of the conference, WONAAC strongly endorsed
the "Abortion Rights Act of 1972," which is to be introduced in
the U. S. Congress by Congresswoman BELLA ABZUG from New York.
This bill would override all laws which impose sanctions upon
those who choose to exercise their individual right to an abortion.
(WF T-1, 2/14/72)
a. Proposed Actions
It was moved and adopted during the above conference
that WONAAC sponsor a week of local abortion activities, May 1-6,
1972, consisting of educational programs, legislative support,
judicial action, and culminating in local or regional demonstra-
tions on May 6, 1972, around the demand for repeal of all anti-
abortion laws and restrictive contraception laws and an end to
forced sterilization.

adopted during the conference:

COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF THE
WOMEN STRIKE FOR PEACE,
Also Known As
Women's International Strike for Peace
A source advised on May 14, 1967, that the Women
Strike for Peace (WSP) in the Southern California area, began
its operations in the late fall of 1961, as an affiliate
of the national organization formed in Washington, DC. It
is a peace oriented women's organization, which is opposed
to the present American foreign policy in Vietnam. It has
also sought legislation which would bring about the abolition
of the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HCUA).
recent months the organization has sponsored demonstrations
protesting the United States involvement in Vietnam and
calling for the complete withdrawal of all United States
troops from Vietnam. In the spring of 1966, it was instrumental
in originating and putting into effect a campaign advocating
support for "peace candidates" in the upcoming 1966 Congressional
elections,
The same source stated that WSP is a non-membership
organization and has no officers. The organization is open
to women of all political opinions who are interested in world
peace. It makes no effort to exclude from its activities
members of, or persons sympathetic to, the Communist Party
and related groups.
•
The guiding force behind the Southern California
WSP groups is MARY CLARKE. A second source advised in July,
1955, that CLARKE was dropped from the Western Division, Los
Angeles County Communist Party (LACCP) in the Spring of 1955,
for personal reasons and not because of any political differences
with the LACCP.
The first source advised that Southern California
WSP maintains its office at 5899 West Pico Boulevard, Los
Angeles. It receives mail through Post Office Box 19739,
Los Angeles 19, California.

For the information of the Bureau and New York,
JK 372-S (former) and JK 337-CS advise that there is a
Women's Liberation group at the University of Florida,
Gainesville, Florida, which recently sponsored an
Abortion Action Week rally, however, none of the
individuals associated with this Women's Lib group are
connected with any subversive organizations such as
Young Socialist Alliance or Socialist Workers Party.
They are merely Women's Liberationists, who support
the repeal of all abortion laws.
In view of the above, no active investigation
is being conducted by the Jacksonville Division of the
Women's Liberation group at the University of Florida, as
there is no present indication they are connected and/or
interested in subversive activities.

A confidential source, who has furnished reliable
information in the past, advised on December 13, 1967, that
the Coordinating Committee of the Washington Mobilization
Committee to End the War in Vietnam (WMC) met on the night
of December 12, 1967, at the local headquarters.at 4402
Georgia Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. Helen Gurewitz
acted as Chairman of the meeting which consisted of
reports on the antidraft week, plans of the Jeannette
Rankin Brigade demonstration and plans for political
action in the anti-Vietnam war movement.
A second source, who has furnished
reliable information in the past,
advised in June, 1964, that Helen
Gurewitz was then a member of the
Communist Party.
According to the first source, Matthew Clark
gave a report on the antidraft week in Washington, D.C.
Clark stated that the activities were not very successful
due to a complete lack of adult support as well as a lack
of funds. He described the week long. protest activity as
very disappointing.
According to the first source, Sue Orrin of the
WMC then gave a report on plans for the Jeannette Rankin
Brigade demonstration. Orrin reported that she had talked
to "New York" on that date and stated that the only major
change in the Brigade's plans was a change of date due to

Re report of ARLAND A. MOSEL dated 3/21/72 at
Washington Field.
The State University of New York at Binghamton
is part of the University system of the State of New York,
and the University at Binghamton has an enrollment of
approximately 7,500 students. The student newspaper
published at the University twice weekly during the school
year in its issue of 10/15/71 carried a brief ad in the
classified section as follows:
"Women who have had abortions needed to relate
their experiences to other women, educate all women
about abortion at abortion speak out October 21. Contact
Linda L., extention 4130."
The 11/12/71, issue of the "Pipedream", student
newspaper published at the State University of New York
at Binghamton, carries an announcement that the Binghamton
Womens Abortion Coalition was selling bus tickets for the
Womens March on Washington for repeal of all abortion laws,
repeal of all contraception laws and no force sterilization
for 11/20/71. Women and men were invited to attend and
tickets were on sale at the student center. Cars and
volunteers were needed and they were to contact LINDA LOEW
at extention 4129.
*Former AL 3487-PST, who is familiar with New
Left activities on the campus of the State University of
New York at Binghamton was contacted regularly during the
school year of 1971-72 and he stated that he did see
some signs on bulletin boards in the Fall of 1971 about
abortion organizations, but never knew them to be of much
success on campus. He stated that he did not see any

activity or signs on any bulletin boards from the period
of approximately January, 1972 until school closed in
May, 1972. This source was contacted 5/16/72. He stateḍ
also at that time that LINDA LOEW has been a close
associate of BETTY SACHS who is the leader of the Young
Socialist Alliance Chapter on campus at the University.
Informant stated that there was no organization formed to
his knowledge of a Womens Abortion Action Coalition in
the Binghamton area.
Other sources familiar with New Left activities
on the campus of the State University of New York at
Binghamton, were contacted during May, 1972, and two
sources advised that they knew of no organization of
Womens Abortion Action Coalition on the campus or in the
Binghamton vicinity during the past year.
Albany Division has had an investigation pending
on LINDA LOEW and a report is being written with appropriate
recommendation for administrative action on LINDA LOEW.
In view of the lack of activity of an Abortion Coalition
organization in the Binghamton area, no further investigation
is being conducted by Albany.

the fact that the organization had learned that Congress will
not reconvene until January 15, 1968. According to Orrin,
two trains from New York City, two airplanes from California
and one bus load from Seattle, Washington, have already been
reserved for participants to the above activity. Orrin
reported that the Brigade wants to have Senator Mansfield
and Speaker of the House McCormick meet the delegation on
the steps to the United States Capitol. Orrin reported that
the "officials in New York" do not expect these two Congress-
men but do think that Senators Morse and Gruening will meet
them and accept their anti-war statement and have this
statement recorded in the Federal Register.
According to the first source, Orrin further
indicated that the present plans for the Brigade call for
other unspecified activity in Washington, D.C., but that
they will not negotiate with local police for permits
ahead of time. Orrin reported that there is a split within
the Brigade between certain groups of women who wish to have
only legal protest activity in Washington, D.C., and another
group which is strongly in favor of illegal activity or
civil disobedience. Following the protest activities on
January 15, 1968, the Brigade plans to go to Georgetown¨¨·
University where they will hold a conference. The details
for this conference will be handled by Donna Allen of
Washington, D.C.
•
According to the first source, the remainder of the
above meeting consisted of a discussion of future political
plans in the anti-war movement concerned primarily with
registration for upcoming primaries in the local areas.

Harold Clayton, Passenger Representative,
Pennsylvania Railroad, Washington, D.C., advised on December
12, 1967, that the Jeannette Rankin Brigade in New York had
previously reserved two trains to travel to Washington, D.C.,
on January 8, 1968. Mr. Clayton stated that this reservation
has now been changed to the date of January 15, 1968.

WOMEN'S NATIONAL ABORTION ACTION COALITION
+
Character: INTERNAL SECURITY COMMUNIST (TROTSKYIST)
Synopsis:
Informants advised the Boston Women's Abortion Action
Coalition (BOWAAC), the local affiliate of the Women's
National Abortion Action Coalition (WONAAC), was formed
during the late summer, 1971, out of the local. Female
Liberation (FL) group. Its headquarters is located at
552 Mass. Avenue, Cambridge. BOWAAC is not a formal
membership group but there are approximately a total
of 20-25 females regularly involved in the group's work.
The Young Socialist Alliance of Boston (YSA-B) and the
Socialist Workers Party (SWP), Boston faction within
BOWAAC, which comprises about half of the activists,
were the controlling force. However, recent reports
indicate this faction has apparently alienated itself
from other activists and does not now believe BOWAAC
can be built into a successful supporter group for the
YSA and SWP locally.

I.
ORGANIZATION
A. Origin and Objectives
The Boston Women's Abortion Action Coalition
(BOWAAC), the local affiliate of the Women's National
Abortion Action Coalition (WONAAC), was formed during
late summer, 1971, out of the local Female Liberation
(FL) group.
BS T-1
November 17, 1971
BOWAAC was originally a subcommittee of FL
in the Greater Boston Area but as of January, 1972, had
grown into a separate group whose specific interest was
in abortion reform. Individuals active in BOWAAC are
also active in other FL work; however, all individuals
active in FL work are not active in BOWAAC, with BOWAAC
being the smaller of the two groups.
BS T-1
January 12, 1972
WONAAC has been publicly described.
as an organization of groups whose aim
is to effect the overthrow of existing
abortion laws and to establish free
abortion on demand.

MIMBER OF SUBJECT_ORGANIZATION
MATILDE MILES, nee ZIMMERMAN, was the Boston
SWP member heading up local SWP/YSA work in BOWAAC but
she and EVELYN CLARK, another Boston SWP member active
in BOWAAC, were then in the process of leaving Boston
for Washington, D.C., to help in organizing a scheduled
November 20, 1971, WONAAC demonstration at Washington,
D.C.

MIMBER OF SUBJECT ORGANIZATION
The YSA and SWP in the Boston area have approxi”
mately 15 of their female members active in FL work
with approximately six to eight in and the controlling forces
of BOWAAC. As of January, 1972, JANE ROLAND, who joined
the Boston SWP in late 1971, was heading up SWP/YSA work in
FL and BOWAAC as MATILDE MILES had not returned to Boston,
but rather transferred to New York.
BS T-1
January 12, 1972
In late January, 1972, TOBA. SINGER and JANE
ROLAND, leaders of the local SWP/YSA FL faction, reported
that there was continuing trouble within FL with respect
to the control of that group by the SWP and YSA forces
and also the direction of FL into any kind of abortion
work.

During early March, 1972, TOBA SINGER reported
that at an incressing rate abortion work was becoming a
more important area of work than FL and that a
number of SWP and YSA female members were being trans-
ferred into the abortion work.
BS T-1
March 26, 1972
The stress of the SWP/YSA female members in the
general Boston area who are active in female matters con-
tinues to be away from FL and into BOWAAC with only two
or three remaining on the fringes to follow FL activities.
BS T-l
May 10, 1972
Recent reports concerning SWP/YSA faction work
within BOWAAC disclose that, as previously occured with
the Party's work within FL, those in the Party faction
have apparently alienated themselves from the other
females active in BOWAAC and for the most part have lost
any support from others not in the Party faction. Any
suggestions now offered by those of the Party faction in
BOWWAC, which comprises approximately half of the activists
in the group, are no longer accepted, cause considerable
argument and there is evidence of "red baiting". As a
result, the Party faction does not now believe that they
can build BOWAAC into any successful supporter type
organization as had resulted through Party work in the
Student Mobilization Committee (SMC).

Leadership and Socialist Workers Party/Young
Socialist Alliance Infiltration
The Young Socialist Alliance of Boston
(YSA-B) is the Boston affiliate of the
YSA, the youth organization of the
Socialist Workers Party (SWP).
The SWP has been designated pursuant to
Executive Order 10450.
The Boston SWP is the local affiliate
and follows the aims and purposes of
the national SWP.
While BOWAAC was not exclusively made up of
Boston SWP and YSA-B female members, as of November,
1971, it was controlled by members of those groups.

Boston SWP and YSA-B members active in BOWAAC
were distributing in January, 1972, a "Housing Fact Sheet"
in an effort to locate housing accommodations for indi-
viduals visiting the Boston area to attend the above
scheduled conference at Boston University.
BS T-1
January 12, 1972
The opening session of the WONAAC Conference,
held at Boston University, February 11-13, 1972, began
on the evening of February 11 and was in the nature of
a rally in Hayden Hall with approximately 600 individuals
present. Of this number approximately 50 were males but
it is noted that this was the only conference session
to which males were invited.
The general theme of the rally was "How to
Win Abortion Law Repeal" and MATILDE MILES, mentioned
previously, was one of the two rally moderators.
Approximately 30 members of the YSA-B and/or
the SWP, Boston, ware in attendance at the rally.
"
The Saturday and Sunday, February 12-13; 1972
sessions, open to women only, were scheduled to include
workshops. on such topics as national and local legisla-.
tive projects, court action, forced sterilization, abor-
tion referral and clinics, campus and high school work
and the building of the Abortion Law Repeal Movement,

At approximately 10:00 A.M., November 20, 1971,
various women's groups from cities within the United
States, including Boston, were observed gathering on the
Ellipse in Washington, D.C., and at approximately 12:10 P.M.
the group, then numbering about 1500, was observed to march
from the Ellipse to the West front of the Capitol building.
One of the signs carried by the marchers read "Boston Repeal

The "Boston Globe", a daily newspaper published
in Boston, in its February 13, 1972 edition, carried an
article entitled "Abortion Strategy Discussed" which in
part reported that more than 800 women from across the
country had gathered for a conference at Boston University
the weekend of February 11-13, 1972 to plan a strategy
to win repeal of all laws that prohibit abortion. Accord-
ing to the article, it was expected that the conference
would endorse the latest Federal bill to nullify all
state laws restricting abortion - "The Abortion Rights
Act of 1972", to be introduced by United States Congress-
woman BELLA ABZUG from New York. The article reported
that discussion at the conference had centered around
whether or not to adopt the slogan "Free Abortion on
Demand; No Forced Sterilization" or to focus on a
single issue - repeal of the abortion laws. It further
reported that a proposal was presented for an Abortion
Action Week, May 1 to 6, 1972, to include educational pro-
grams, legislative support, judicial action and local or
regional demonstrations centering around the demand for
repeal of all anti-abortion and anti-contraception laws
and an end to forced sterilization.
JANE ROLAND, identified in the article as
coordinator of BOWAAC, was reported to have stated that
whatever the conference does nationally her organization
would be acting at the local level.
The February 13, 1972, session of the WONAAC
Conference at Boston University was in the form of
workshops held in approximately eight classrooms with
about 50 females in attendance at each workshop.

maximum number of persons present at any one time dur-
ing the day would be estimated at between 400 to 500.
The workshops primarily related to the building of WONAAC
throughout the United States, fund raising and regional
work, with ideas being exchanged between individuals
attending from various areas of the country, including
Boston. The major theme appeared to be how to strengthen
awareness of WONAAC, which was reportedly in need of
financial support. Literature tables were set up on the
periphery of the workshops and among organizations iden-
tified with the tables was the YSA.

February 13, 1972
The "Boston Globe" in its February 14, 1972
edition carried an article entitled "Women's Group
Backs Abortion Bill" which reported that the above-
mentioned "Abortion Rights Act of 1972" had received
strong endorsement from WONAAC at the close of its
second national conference. The article reported that
to implement the endorsement, coclition chapters intended
to publicize the text of the bill, which proposed to
repeal all abortion laws, and to have speakers on legis
lation at forums, teach-ins, rallies, and other educa-
tional activities. The article further reported that.
the proposals adopted at the convention were: that the
coalition sponsor an Abortion Action Week, May 1 - 6,
1972; that a telegram be sent to the New York' Court of
Appeals and Governor NELSON A. ROCKEFELLER condemning the
Court's February 10, 1972 decision denying women on

"
Vincent Hallinan was candidate for President
of the United States on the Independent Progressive Party
ticket in 1952. This party was formed in California in 1948
and ceased to exist in 1954, when it failed to poll sufficient
votes to remain on a California ballot. The California
Senate Fact-Finding Committee on Un-American Activities in
its 1955 report on page forty-six, states in part that the
Independent Progressive Party in California was quickly
captured by the communists and soon was being operated lock,
stock and barrel by the Communist Party of California.
A source advised on April 20, 1966, that Vincent
Hallinan was the Treasurer for American Institute For Marxist
Studies (AIMS).
A characterization of AIMS
is contained in the appendix.
According to the source, it is the aim and
objective of Vivian Hallinan when she goes to Washington,
D.C., in conjunction with the Rankin Brigade to get herself
arrested as she believes that nothing can be accomplished
unless the women are arrested and then do their talking
from jail.

Here it is, the long-awaited first call upon women to join the
Jeannette Rankin Brigade. I'm enclosing copics --hope you can
find means to duplicate these for your community.
Much has happened since I talked to you --exciting things, much
response, and some firm dates. A great deal of time was spent with
Miss Rankin in order to do this in the way that she felt was best. A
there were other very important things already in the hopper, such as
Women Strike for Peace in Washington on Sept. 20, and the tremendous
Stop the Draft "eak of Oct. 16 - 21, all taking the time and

We will endeavor to enter the 1'.S. Congress to present our demand for
end to the war, These plans will be formally announced on November 1

Now is the time to organize those in your community, to find tho
who can go to Washington and those who will support us by lending the
names on helping in other ways. Now is the time to bring this up in
churches, P.T.A. 's and women's organizations, including union auxiliar

We have been in touch with many men, important in their fields

who have offerred to spon-

sponsors. Among these at present are Dagmar Wilson, Cloretta King,
Ruth Krause, Esther Pike, and Jessica Mitford. Interested men are be

YOU CANNOT HAVE
WARS WITHOUT
WOMEN
Women must use their minds, their voices, and
their bodies to stop the killing in Vietnam; to do
less is to ignore our special responsibilities to
the human race.
"10,000 women have sat back and let their sons
be killed in Vietnam. If we had 10,000 women
willing to go to jail if necessary we could stop
the war in Vietnam. You cannot have wars with-
out women."
Jeannette Rankin made the above statement in
May of this year. Fifty years ago, as the first
woman elected to Congress, she voted against
World War I. She has consistently maintained
her struggle for peace, and at 86 she is as coura-
geous and vigorous as ever--an inspiration to all
women.
The presence of the United States forces in the int
ernal struggle of Vietnam is immoral and illegal.
There can be no possible justification for our inte
ference in the domestic affairs of this tiny distant
land.
This 86-year-old woman has stated that she is wi
ing to stay in jail until the bombing is stopped. N
all women are free to join her, but we can assure
her that thousands of women will march peacefull
beside her. Some will picket, others will go to ja
with Miss Rankin. Every woman's participation i
equally valuable. We are confident each one will
the maximum of which she is capable.
On January 8th, women from all over the land wil
converge on Washington to demand the end of this
dishonorable war. We shall come as individuals,
or as organizations, but we shall join together as
concerned women under the aegis of Jeannette Ra

AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR MARXIST STUDIES
A source advised on April 9, 1963, that on April 7,
1963, at a meeting of the District Committee of the Communist
Party, United States of America (CPUSA), of New England, held
in Boston, Massachusetts, HERBERT APTHEKER stated he was
developing an organization called American Institute for
Marxist Studies (AIMS), which would eventually legalize the
CP. He stated AIMS would publish literature on History,
Science, Physics, Archeology and other subjects which would
be put out quarterly with various supplements.
A second source advised on June 30, 1966, that
HERBERT APTHEKER was elected to the National Committee,
CPUSA, at the 18th National Convention of the CPUSA, held
June 22-26, 1966, in New York City.
A third source advised on June 7, 1963, that on
June 3, 1963, HERBERT APTHEKER spoke at the CPUSA, New York
District Board meeting concerning AIMS. APTHEKER stated
that AIMS would unite and strengthen the CP although the CP
would not be connected with it. He stated AIMS was being
formed to operate within the scope of the McCarran and Smith
Acts and would legally bring Marxist material and opinions
to the attention of American scholars and the general public.
A fourth source reported on August 29, 1966, that
AIMS issues a "Newsletter" every other month. This source
also made available the information that AIMS issues publications
and holds symposiums concerning Marxism.
A fifth source advised on May 9, 1967, that as of
that date, AIMS was located on the fifth floor west of 20
West 30th Street, New York, New York.

WOMEN'S INTERNATIONAL LEAGUE FOR PEACE AND FREEDOM (T
In a leaflet dated January, 1962, WILPF described
itself as follows:
"What is the WILPF?
"It is the Women's International League for
Peace and Freedom, an international, inter-
racial organization striving for peace and
freedom by nor-violent democratic methods.
It was founded in 1915, during the first
World War, and its first president was JANE
ADDAMS the first American woman to win the
Nobel Peace Prize.
'
"How Does it Work?
"It keeps its membership informed on current
problems through its legislative office in
Washington. It issues its own pamphlets,
study kits, fact sheets, and cooperates with
like-minded organizations. WILPF has con-
sultative status at the United Nations on a
national and international level.
"What Does it Do?
"WILPF, through its local branches, sponsors
public discussion on such topics as disarma-
ment and world law, nuclear testing, civil
defense, Berlin, civil rights, etc. Through
its Peace Action Committee, IL initiates
peace walks, vigils, and meetings, as an
organization and with other peace groups.
Peace education for children is a special
concern of WILPF:
"How Is it Set Up?
"The Women's International League for Peace and
Freedom has its national headquarters at JANE
ADDAMS House, 2006 Walnut Street, Philadelphia 3,
Pa., where its monthly paper, FOUR LIGHTS, is
published. Its legislative office is at 120
Maryland Avenue, N.E., Washington 2, D. C.
International headquarters are in Geneva. The
International meets every three years. It
conducts summer schools, peace congresses and
publishes its magazine, PAX."

SEATTLE WOMEN ACT FOR PEACE (SWAP)
A source reported on May 17, 1962, a meeting of the
Ballard-Greenwood CP Club was held in Seattle, April 25, 1962,
at which TAIMI HALONEN was nominated to be the new Chairman of
this Club. Along with other business of the evening, HALONEN
said she expected to devote a good portion of her time to SWAP,
an organization of peace forces that met recently with seven
members. She said four of the seven were from the "left" but
did not go into detail. She said the group had problems of an
organizational nature because it was new, and she thought she
could help.
On April 5, 1963, a second source stated a meeting of
the University CP Club was held at Seattle on April 2, 1963.
KEN ROSE, a member of the Club, reported the most influential
peace organization in Seattle was SWAP.
On July 31, 1964, a meeting of the North Central CP
Section Committee was held at Seattle. WILL PARRY, Section
Chairman, said attention should be placed on three political
questions - peace, civil rights, and labor. Under peace, he
said CP clubs should inject the Women Act for Peace campaign
into the election campaign. At another Section meeting,
February 5, 1966, TAIMI HALONEN was praised for effective
peace work and for her help in developing unity among the peace
forces. Section-wide concentration was urged in assisting
SWAP to visit 1,000 workers on the Vietnam issue.
A third source advised on February 24, 1966, a
Northwest District CP Committee meeting was held at Seattle
February 12, 1966. After lunch, the entire group participated
in passing out leaflets pertaining to racial matters and the
Vietnam war which carried the name of SWAP, 5411 Ravenna Avenue-
Northeast, Seattle, Washington 98105, which address has been
used consistently by SWAP and is that of ANCI KOPPEL, also known
as Mrs. CHARLES KOPPEL. KOPPEL has been and continues to be
the coordinator and apparent prime motivating force of SWAP
as of May, 1967.
A fourth source reported in 1945
ANCI KOPPEL was a member of the
Professional Group of the Communist
Political Association (CPA), also
known as the Rogers CP Club at
Seattle, Washington.
The CPA has been designated by the
Attorney General of the United States

the Jeannette Rankin Brigade has sent out a call for a
demonstration to be held at the White House, Washington, D. C.,

The Secretary of the Brigade has been identified
as Vivian Hallinan, the wife of Vincent Hallinan who in 1966
was identified as the Treasurer for the American Institute
of Marxist Studies, a communist front organization.
One source has described the Brigade as a "one-shot"
organization formed by women in various cities to hold demon-
strations "all over" the U.S. on 1/8/68.
15
In its call for the above demonstration, Brigade
literature urges participants to enter the U.S. Congress to
present demands for an end to the war.
All offices immediately alert sources concerning
this demonstration. All information developed is to be
immediately reported to the Bureau and Washington Field by
teletype followed by memorandum, original and ten copies,
under the above caption for dissemination to all interested
agencies. Teletypes must contain sufficient identifying
data to enable the Bureau to characterize organizations and
individuals supporting the demonstration without resorting
to file reviews. Such statements as "a Security Index
subject" or "subject of a Bureau investigation" should not
be used. The Bureau is not to be referred to its files for
identifying information.
K
It is essential that all individuals with subversive
backgrounds and subversive organizations participating in
this demonstration be identified.
Informant coverage of groups that plan to support
the Brigade and to participate in the demonstration is to
be arranged. It is imperative that the Bureau be able to
pinpoint subversive organizations and individuals partici-
pating in the demonstration.
Each office is to make particular effort to
develop information regarding the financial backing of
individuals and groups that may participate in the demon-
stration.

The San Francisco Office has reported that an
organization known as the Jeannette Rankin Brigade has sent
out a call for women from throughout the Nation to demonstrate
at the White House on 1/8/68. This call also urges partici-
pants to "enter the U.S. Congress" to present demands for an
end to the war.
Jeannette Rankin, who is the Chairman of the
Brigade, is an 86-year-old resident of Watkinsville, Georgia.
She was a Congresswoman from Montana from 1917 to 1919 and
served one term in 1940. She voted against U.S. involvement
in World Wars I and II. Rankin has publicly protested the
war in Vietnam and has asserted her willingness to go to
jail in protest of the bombing.
The Secretary of the Brigade has been identified
as Vivian Hallinan, the wife of Vincent Hallinan who was
identified in 1966 as the Treasurer for the American Institute
of Marxist Studies, a communist front organization.
The above information has been furnished to the
White House, the Department of State, the Attorney General
and military intelligence.
In view of the Bureau's responsibility to identify
subversive elements which may participate in the demonstration
sponsored by this group and to keep the White House and other
agencies advised of developments, it is felt that the field
should be notified of the proposed demonstration and furnished
with instructions for handling information concerning it,
including the need for informant coverage of participating
groups.

APPENDIX
SEATTLE WOMEN ACT FOR PEACE (SWAP)
A source reported on May 17, 1962, a meeting of the
Ballard-Greenwood CP Club was held in Seattle, April 25, 1962,
at which TAIMI HALONEN was nominated to be the new Chairman of
this Club. Along with other business of the evening, HALONEN
said she expected to devote a good portion of her time to SWAP,
an organization of peace forces that met recently with seven
members. She said four of the seven were from the "left" but
did not go into detail. She said the group had problems of an
organizational nature because it was new, and she thought she
could help.
On April 5, 1963, a second source stated a meeting of
the University CP Club was held at Seattle on April 2, 1963.
KEN ROSE, a member of the Club, reported the most influential
peace organization in Seattle was SWAP.
On July 31, 1964, a meeting of the North Central CP
Section Committee was held at Seattle. WILL PARRY,
WILL PARRY, Section
Chairman, said attention should be placed on three political
questions - peace, civil rights, and labor. Under peace, he
said CP clubs should inject the Women Act for Peace campaign
into the election campaign. At another Section meeting,
February 5, 1966, TAIMI HALONEN was praised for effective
peace work and for her help in developing unity among the peace
forces.
Section-wide concentration was urged in assisting.
SWAP to visit 1,000 workers on the Vietnam issue.
A third source advised on February 24, 1966, a
Northwest District CP Committee meeting was held at Seattle
February 12, 1966. After lunch, the entire group participated
in passing out leaflets pertaining to racial matters and the
Vietnam war which carried the name of SWAP, 5411 Ravenna Avenue
Northeast, Seattle, Washington. 98105, which address has been
used consistently by SWAP and is that of ANCI KOPPEL, also known
as Mrs. CHARLES KOPPEL. KOPPEL has been and continues to be
the coordinator and apparent prime motivating force of SWAP
as of May, 1967.
A fourth source reported in 1945
ANCI KOPPEL was a member of the
Professional Group of the Communist
Political Association (CPA), also
known as the Rogers CP Club at
Seattle, Washington.
j
The CPA has been designated by the
Attorney General of the United States
pursuant to Executive Order 10450.

BRIGADE FORMED TO CONFRONT CONGRESS
1
Helena, Montana
November 27, 1967
To all American Women:
I am proud of the fact that my first
vote cast in Congress was a vote
against war. It was the first oppor-
unity for a woman to vote, because I
was the first woman to be elected to
Congress.
I believed then, as I do today,
that women are the ones that must be
concerned with the needs and develop-
ment of the human race. I have always
fought for the dignity of all human
beings for those of the present as
well as those of future generations.
-
I will continue to struggle as long
as I live. I hope all women will res-
pond to the following call and join me
in Washington on January 8, 1968, the
opening day of Congress.
Jeannette Rankin
A CALL TO ALL AMERICAN WOMEN who
are outraged by the ruthless slaughter
in Vietnam and the persistent neglect
of human needs at home TO COME TO
WASHINGTON ON JANUARY 8
AMERICAN WOMEN represent 51% of the
voting population of our country.
AMERICAN WOMEN have the power to a-
chieve peace and a decent life for
every American.
This is woman power:
Demonstrate it to the Congress of the
United States! Come to Washington on
January 8 as Congress opens in joint
session. Support Jeannette Rankin as
she leads a representative delegation
of American women to the Capitol to
demand that:
*Congress, as its first order
of business, resolve to end
the war in Vietnam and immedi-
ately arrange for the with-
drawal of all American troops.
*Congress use its power to make
reparations for the ravaged land
we leave behind in Vietnam.
*Congress listen to what the
American people are saying and
refuse the insatiable demands of
the military-industrial complex.
WOMEN OF AMERICA, our power is un-
limited. On January 8, American women
will:
*PETITION the United States Con-
gress
*CONVENE a Congress of American
Women that afternoon to develop
programs to meet the crisis in
America
-
programs which will
express our political power,
reason and conscience.
For further information about the
Brigade, contact your nearest WSP
group or write to the Jeannette Rankin
Brigade, 133 W. 72 St., N.Y. 10023

DEMONSTRATION PROTESTING UNITED STATES POLICY
IN VIETNAM, WASHINGTON, D. C., JANUARY 8, 1968
INFORMATION CONCERNING (INTERNAL SECURITY)
The following information has been made available
by sources who have furnished reliable information in the
past:
Source One reported on December 7, 1967, that copies
of "La Wisp", monthly newsletter of the Southern California
Council of the Women Strike for Peace (WSP - see appendix)
being mailed to the WSP mailing list on that date contained
a "Call" from the Jeannette Rankin Brigade (JRB) "To all
American women", announcing a proposed march on Washington,
D. C., on January 8, 1968, when the United States Congress
opens in joint session. This march would be to demand that
Congress, as its first order of business, resolve to end
the war in Vietnam and immediately arrange for the with-
drawal of all American troops. (A xerox duplication of the
first page of the above-mentioned December 1967 issue of
"La Wisp", containing this "Call", is appended to this
memorandum.)
The partial list of JRB sponsors included in this
issue of the "La Wisp", contained the names of only two
women presently active in the Southern California area,
Mary Clarke (see characterization of her in the appendix
page on WSP.), and motion picture actress Leslie Parrish.
Source One has advised that Parrish has only
recently become interested in activities of WSP and has
attended less than five WSP activities. Source Two reported

For the Bureau's information a sub-committee has
been formed within the Southern California Council of the

publicize the JRB. This committee consists of MARY/CLARKE A
and EVA KORN, who are mentioned in the details of instant
LHM. It also includes INFORMANT nd GERALDINE SHAPIRO (also
known as GERRY (SHAPIRO). The latter; is a relatively new
member of the WSP having attended some six meetings between
2/7/67 and 10/10/67, and has not been the subject of active
investigation by this office. To further protect INFORMANT
. her name and the name of GERALDINE SHAPIRO are not being
included in details of instant LHM, as it is hoped that
suspicion may be directed toward SHAPIRO at a later date to
indicate she might be an informant for some investigating.

There has been no attempt to characterize the
listed individuals in the "partial list of sponsors" set
out in the "La Wisp" issue of December 1967, a xerox copy
of which is attached, with the exception of LESLIE PARRISH
and MARY CLARKE (the only local Southern California women).
PARRISH has not been the subject of active investigation
by the Los Angeles, Division as she has been reported, in
attendance at less than five WSP activities.

NELL BORDEN has advised that actress VIVECA LINDFORS;
who formerly appeared in some Hollywood film productions,

CONFIDENTIAL
Rankin Brigade should be made up of only those women who
volunteer to participate with the prior understanding that
they should be ready to spend at least two months in jail
for the commission of civil disobedience while in Washington,
D. C.
Sunderland also suggested that a good way to recruit
women to join the Brigade would be, to make a pitch for
recruits when Mary Clarke, Dagmar Wilson and Ruth Krause
are making their respective speaking engagements across the
United States since their return from a trip to North Vietnam,
which they visited as representatives of WSP during the d
fall of 1967.

Source Four advised during the summer of 1965
that June Sunderland, 3730 Hollister Avenue,
Santa Barbara, California, had attended a 1967
"peace conference" in Helsinki, Finland, at the
invitation of the Communist Party (CP), and that
funds to cover her expenses were raised in part
by the CP3B and that following her attendance at
the Helsinki affair she went on to Russia for ten
days at the invitation and expense of the Soviet
Government.
Source One learned that a communication was re-
ceived from eastern sponsors of the JRB on December 7, 1967,
indicating that the JRB march on Washington might not be
held on January 8, 1968, but possibly would be set back until
either the 15th or 22nd of January 1968, depending upon
the date that the United States Congress would reconvene.
The communication indicated that since the entire purpose
of the Brigade would be to confront the opening joint session
of Congress that it would be futile to schedule the march
prior to the date Congress would reconvene. The suggestion
was made that recruitment of local women to participate in
the JRB be held in abeyance until a confirmation had been
obtained indicating the date on which Congress would reconvene.
Source One, had indicated that although the "Call",
as reproduced in "La Wisp", states, "There will be local
actions across the country at the same time as the action
in Washington, D. C., that there are no current plans for

COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF THE
WOMEN STRIKE FOR PEACE,
Also Known As
Women's International Strike for Peace
A source advised on May 14, 1967, that the Women
Strike for Peace (WSP) in the Southern California area began
its operations in the late fall of 1961, as an affiliate
of the national organization formed in Washington, D.C. It
is a peace oriented women's organization, which is opposed
to the present American foreign policy in Vietnam. It has
also sought legislation which would bring about. the abolition
of the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HCUA). In
recent months the organization has sponsored demonstrations
protesting the United States involvement in Vietnam and
calling for the complete withdrawal of all United States
troops from Vietnam. In the spring of 1966, it was instrumental
in originating and putting into effect a campaign advocating
support for "peace candidates" in the upcoming 1966 Congressional
elections.
The same source stated that WSP is a non-membership
organization and has no officers. The organization is open
to women of all political opinions who are interested in world
peace. It makes no effort to exclude from its activities
members of, or persons sympathetic to, the Communist Party
and related groups.
•
,
The guiding force behind the Southern California
WSP groups is MARY CLARKE. A second source advised in July.
1955, that CLARKE was dropped from the Western Division, Los
Angeles County Communist Party (LACCP) in the Spring of 1955,
for personal reasons and not because of any political differences
with the LACCP.
The first source advised that Southern California
WSP maintains its office at 5899 West Pico Boulevard, Los
Angeles. It receives mail through Post Office Box 19739,
Los Angeles 19, California.

WASHINGTON, D. C.,
JANUARY 15, 1968
A confidential source, who has furnished reliable
information in the past, advised on December 13, 1967, that
the Coordinating Committee of the Washington Mobilization
Committee to End the War in Vietnam (WMC) met on the night
of December 12, 1967, at the local headquarters.at 4402
Georgia Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. Helen Gurewitz
acted as Chairman of the meeting which consisted of
reports on the antidraft week, plans of the Jeannette
Rankin Brigade demonstration and plans for political
action in the anti-Vietnam war movement.
A second source, who has furnished
reliable information in the past,
advised in June, 1964, that Helen
Gurewitz was then a member of the
Communist Party.
According to the first source, Matthew Clark
gave a report on the antidraft week in Washington, D.C.
Clark stated that the activities were not very successful
due to a complete lack of adult support as well as a lack
of funds. He described the week long. protest activity as
very disappointing.
According to the first source, Sue Orrin of the
WMC then gave a report on plans for the Jeannette Rankin
Brigade demonstration. Orrin reported that she had talked
to "New York" on that date and stated that the only major
change in the Brigade's plans was a change of date due to

the fact that the organization had learned that Congress will
not reconvene until January 15, 1968. According to Orrin,
two trains from New York City, two airplanes from California
and one bus load from Seattle, Washington, have already been
reserved for participants to the above activity. Orrin
reported that the Brigade wants to have Senator Mansfield
and Speaker of the House McCormick meet the delegation on.
the steps to the United States Capitol. Orrin reported that
the "officials in New York" do not expect these two Congress-
men but do think that Senators Morse and Gruening will meet
them and accept their anti-war statement and have this
statement recorded in the Federal Register.
According to the first source, Orrin further
indicated that the present plans for the Brigade call for
other unspecified activity in Washington, D.C., but that
they will not negotiate with local police for permits
ahead of time. Orrin reported that there is a split within
the Brigade between certain groups of women who wish to have
only legal protest activity in Washington, D.C., and another
group which is strongly in favor of illegal activity or
civil disobedience, Following the protest activities on
January 15, 1968, the Brigade plans to go to Georgetown ¨
University where they will hold a conference. The details
for this conference will be handled by Donna Allen of
Washington, D.C.

.
According to the first source, the remainder of the
above meeting consisted of a discussion of future political
plans in the anti-war movement concerned primarily with
registration for upcoming primaries in the local areas.
Harold Clayton, Passenger Representative,
Pennsylvania Railroad, Washington, D.C., advised on December
12, 1967, that the Jeannette Rankin Brigade in New York had
previously reserved two trains to travel to Washington, D.C.,
on January 8, 1968. Mr. Clayton stated that this reservation
has now been changed to the date of January 15, 1968.

RE:
DEMONSTRATION PROTESTING UNITED STATES
POLICY IN VIETNAM, WASHINGTON, D. C.
JANUARY 8, 1968
INFORMATION CONCERNING
Reference is made to a previous memorandum dated
November 27, 1967, concerning captioned demonstration which
was titled Jeannette Rankin's Brigade, Information Concerning.
On December 13, 1967, a confidential source who has
furnished reliable information in the past, made available a
leaflet received from ANCI KOPPEL, leader of Seattle Women
Act for Peace (SWAP), which indicates SWAP is attempting to
help mobilize a "Nationwide Congress of Women" to be held in
Washington, D. C., January 8, 1968, on the opening day of
Congress. The leaflet suggests participants "represent
ourselves in Congress" and "test our WOMAN POWER." A repro-
duction of the leaflet is attached.
JEANNETE RANKIN, the Chairman of the Brigade,
is an 86-year-old resident of Watkinsville,
Georgia, who served in the House of Repre-
sentatives as a Congresswoman from Montana from
1917 to 1919 and who was elected to that office
for one term in 1940. She has repeatedly opposed
U. S. involvement in foreign wars and voted
against declarations of war by the U. S. in both
World Wars I and II.
ANCI KOPPEL and SWAP are characterized in the
appendix.
On December 14, 1967, DALE JENSEN, Charter Service
Department, Greyhound Bus Lines, Seattle, advised ANCI KOPPEL
has previously made arrangements for charter buses for various
activities of her organization but thus far has not requested
space for a trip to Washington, D. C. in January, 1968.

SEATTLE WOMEN ACT FOR PEACE (SWAP)
A source reported on May 17, 1962, a meeting of the
Ballard-Greenwood CP Club was held in Seattle, April 25, 1962,
at which TAIMI HALONEN was nominated to be the new Chairman of
this Club. Along with other business of the evening, HALONEN
said she expected to devote a good portion of her time to SWAP,
an organization of peace forces that met recently with seven
members. She said four of the seven were from the "left" but
did not go into detail. She said the group had problems of an
organizational nature because it was new, and she thought she
could help.
On April 5, 1963, a second source stated a meeting of
the University CP Club was held at Seattle on April 2, 1963.
KEN ROSE, a member of the Club, reported the most influential
peace organization in Seattle was SWAP.
On July 31, 1964, a meeting of the North Central CP
Section Committee was held at Seattle. WILL PARRY, Section
Chairman, said attention should be placed on three political
questions - · peace, civil rights, and labor. Under peace, he
said CP clubs should inject the Women Act for Peace campaign
into the election campaign. At another Section meeting,
February 5, 1966, TAIMI HALONEN was praised for effective
peace work and for her help in developing unity among the peace
forces. Section-wide concentration was urged in assisting
SWAP to visit 1,000 workers on the Vietnam issue.
A third source advised on February 24, 1966; a
Northwest District CP Committee meeting was held at Seattle
February 12, 1966. After lunch, the entire group participated
in passing out leaflets pertaining to racial matters and the
Vietnam war which carried the name of SWAP, 5411 Ravenna Avenue
Northeast, Seattle, Washington 98105, which address has been
used consistently by SWAP and is that of ANCI KOPPEL, also known
as Mrs. CHARLES KOPPEL. KOPPEL has been and continues to be
the coordinator and apparent prime motivating force of SWAP
as of May, 1967.
A fourth source reported in 1945
ANCI KOPPEL was a member of the
Professional Group of the Communist
Political Association (CPA), also
known as the Rogers CP Club at
Seattle, Washington.
The CPA has been designated by the
Attorney General of the United States
pursuant to Executive Order 10450.

Baltrun in May, 1934, gave her political
preference as Communist.
On April 9, 1943, a source advised

that she attended the first party con-

Sonia Baltrun was not a chartered member

W.E.B. DU BOIS CLUBS OF AMERICA (DCA)
A source advised that on October 26-27, 1963, a con-
ference of members of the Communist Party, USA (CPUSA), including
national functionaries, met in Chicago, Illinois, for the purpose
of setting in motion forces for the establishment of a new national
Marxist -oriented youth organization which would hunt for the most
peaceful transition to socialism. The delegates were told that it
would be reasonable to assume that the young socialists attracted
into this new organization would eventually pass into the CP
itself.
A second source has advised that the founding convention
for the new youth organization was held from June 19-21, 1964,
at 150 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, California, at which
time the name W.E.B.DuBois Clubs of America (DCA) was adopted.
Approximately 500 delegates from throughout the United States
attended this convention.
The second source advised in September, 1966, that MIKE
ZAGARELL, CPUSA Youth Director, stated that in Negro communities
the Party still supported the plan to build "left" socialist
centers and to solidify the Party base through the DCA.. This
scurce also advised in September, 1966 that DANIEL RUBIN, CPUSA
National Organizational Secretary, stated the Party believes
the DCA should have a working-class outlook and be a mass organiz-
ation favorable to socialism, socialist countries and Marxism,
and in April, 1967, advised GUS HALL, CPUSA General Secretary,
had indicated the DCA primary emphasis should be on developing
mass resistance to the draft.
A third source advised in September, 1967, that JARVIS
TYNER was elected chairman of the DCA on September 10, 1967, at
the Third National Convention of the DCA held in New York, New
York, from September 8-10, 1967.
A fourth source advised during August, 1967, that JARVIS
TYNER is a member of the National Committee of the CPUSA.
A fifth source advised on September 21, 1967, that the
headquarters of the DCA is located at 34 West 17th Street, New
York, New York.

WOMEN FOR PEACE aka
Women Strike for Peace

The "Berkeley Daily Gazette," a daily newspaper of
general circulation published in Berkeley, California,
contained an article in the November 19, 1965, evening
edition reflecting that in November, 1961, when con-
cern mounted over radioactive fallout from nuclear
testing, a group of women in Washington, D. C. started
Women Strike for Peace. The idea spread rapidly through-
out the country and now embraces 900 groups, including
Women For Peace groups in the San Francisco Bay area.
These groups support programs to achieve goals such as:
Continued disarmament negotiations.
(1)
(2)
(3)
A strong and flexible United Nations.
Planning now at state and national levels for
conversion to peace-time economy and positive
efforts to ease world tensions.
The women act as individuals and as a group, with specific
actions suggested by individuals and groups from all over
the world. Decision to participate jointly on any given
suggestion is democratly arrived at by members of the Co-
ordinating Committee. Effective cooperation with other
peace groups is encouraged. Monthly Coordinating Committee
meetings and general meetings, as warranted, are open to
all and announced in mailings to members. There are no
dues or membership forms nor conditions for membership.
To stir an awareness of the need for peace, Women For
Peace encourage public education in peace objectives at
local schools and sponsor peace-oriented demonstrations
and public meetings, newspaper ads, billboards, and
candidates for public office. On the national level
the group attempts to influence government officials
by letters and conferences.

TO ALL AMERICAN WOMEN,
November 27, 1967
I am proud of the fact that my first vote cast in Congress
was a vote against war. It was the first opportunity for a
woman to vote because I was the first woman to be elected
to Congress.
I believed then as I do today that women are the ones who
must be concerned with the needs and development of the
human race. I have always fought for the dignity of all
for those of the present as well as those
human beings
of future generations.
I will continue to struggle as long as I live.
I hope all women will respond to the following CALL, and
join me in Washington on January 8, 1968, the opening
day of Congress.
Jam
With highest hopes,
the

to Mrs. VIVIAN WILLIAMS by letter dated-October, 1967 which
was not delivered at Philadelphia until November, 1967,

of her son, RONALD LOCKMAN...
HALLINAN originally had wanted WILLIAMS to be at
the launching of the Brigade at a press conference to be held.
in Washington, D. C., on Veterans Day, 11/11/67, along with
mothers, sisters, and widows of men killed in Vietnam.
HALLINAN desired WILLIAMS to furnish her with the names of
mothers and wives of men killed in Vietnam who felt their
loved ones should not have been there at all.
Since Mrs. WILLIAMS did not return until after
11/11/67, she did not know of the event, and therefore, did
not participate.. Additionally, she did not get around to
reading all her mail until much after she returned to
Philadelphia.
This was the reason the source did not learn of this
Brigade until December.

"10,000 women have sat back and let their
be killed in Vietnam. If we had 10,000 women
willing to co to jail, if necessary, we could
stop the war. You cannot have wars without
Women."
Jeannette Rankin made the above statement in May of
this year, when the country was told that 10,000 American
boys had died in Vietnam.
elected to Congress in the United States she said, "I want
to stand by my country but I cannot vote for war."
Fifty years ago as the first woman
Miss Rankin was a militant fighter for women's
suffrage, and has been a vehement and consistent voice against
war. Still a strong feminist, Miss Ranking is now building a
self supporting women's cooperative homestead in Georgia. At
86 she is as courageous and vigorous as ever, holding staunchly
to her beliefs that war is immoral. This May, after her
statement against the war in Vietnam, Mies Rankin was deluged
with letters from women across the nation who applauded her
position. Miss Rankin was enthusiastic when asked to transform
her words into a demonstrative effort, and thus the Jeannette
Rankin Prigade was born. We are seeking the sponsorship of
women of stature and prestige who represent the many facets of
our national life. This accomplished we feel sure that
thousands of women who have never been moved to action will
find their place with the Brigade. This will be a single effort,
and will be joined by women individually, and through organizational
We are trying to provido the framework in which
affiliations,

every concerned woman will feel comfortable.
Miss Rankin places the Brigade in an historical context
as a continuation of the efforts of the Abolitionists, and the
Suffragettes, representing the best of American traditions.
What are you willing to do to save your son, your brother,
What are
your husband from killing and being killed in Vietnam?
you willing to do to put an end to the senseless waste of
American and Vietnamese lives?
We have written letters to our President and Congressmen;
we have taken full page advertisements pleading for a halt to this
war; we have marched; we have wept; we have been ignored.
Thousands of women are willing to go to Washington to
demand that our President end this war now. In 1954 he said,
"I an against sending American G.I.'s into the mud and muck of
Indo-China on a bloodletting spree to perpetuato .colonialism
and white man's exploitation in Asia," In 1984 he was elected
to the presidency on the promise that his adrinistration would
bring peace in Vietnam.
Wo gave him our vote. We are giving him
our men No More! As citizens we have the right to have our
grievances heard. We will be heard if it means a massive act
of peaceful civil disobedience to achieve it.
Will you Join us to save the men you love from death,
and the country you love fron sheme?

WITHOUT WOMEN
Women must use their minds, their voices, and
their bodies to stop the killing in Vietnam; to do
less is to ignore our special responsibilities to
the human race.
"10,000 women have sat back and let their sons
be killed in Vietnam. If we had 10,000 women will-
ing to go to jail if necessary we could stop the war
in Vietnam. You cannot have wars without ronisn."
Jeannette Rankin made the above statement in
May of this year. Fifty years ago, as the first
woman elected to Congress, she voted against World
War I. She has consistently maintained her strug-
gle for peace, and at 86 she is as courageous and
vigorous as ever an inspiration to all women.
--
The presence of the United States forces in
the internal struggle of Vietnam is immoral and
illegal. There can be no possible justification
for our interference in the domestic affairs of
this tiny distant land.
,
This 86-year-old woman has stated that she
is willing to stay in jail until the bombing is
stopped. Not all women are free to join her, but
we can assure her that thousands of women will
march peacefully beside her. Some will picket,
others will go to jail until bail is arranged,
and others will stay in jail with Miss Renkin.
Every woman's participation is equally valuable.
We are confident each one will do the maximum of
which she is capable.
On January 8th, women from all over the land
will converge on Washington to demand the end of
this dishonorable war. He shall come as individ-
uals, or as organizations, but we shall join to-
gether as concerned women under the aegis of
Jeannette Rankin,
Will you join us to save the men you love
from death, and the country you love from shame?

Dear Friend:
We are sending this letter to you and others from whom we have not heard much
recently, in the hope of re-enlisting your efforts in the Women for Peace
movement. It has been too long since we last heard directly from many of you,
and our meetings with those of you whom we have seen recently have been brief.
Of course, we know the paralyzing sense of frustration we all feel occasionally,
as we learn of the mounting horrors in Vietnam. But this feeling is only
temporary, and quickly gives way to activity. As women, we bear the major
responsibility for the preservation of life, and thus a major responsibility
in the peace movement.
Enclosed you will find an announcement of the latest national women's effort
for peace.
Several peace groups in Portland are cooperating in raising funds
to send representatives to Washington. We hope that you will also support this
effort, to insure representation from Portland Women for Peace.
The coupon
on the enclosed notice is for your use in this effort.
In addition, we will have a supportive peaceful demonstration
in Portland at
NOON, Monday, JANUARY 15th
Pioneer Post Office
5th and Morrison
We are asking participants to wear black, and to bring a black
(or dark colored) umbrella. We shall carry the umbrellas opened,
rain or shine. Placards (to wear) and leaflets (to distribute),
expressing support for the Jeannette Rankin Brigade, will be
available. We shall march around the Post Office block for one hour,
from noon to 1 p.m., leafleting as we walk.
·
We hope, if you cannot go to Washington, yourself, that you will contribute to
help someone else to go, and that you will also join with us at the Pioneer
Post Office at noon Monday, January 15th.
In addition, please let us hear from you on your ideas of what more we might
do locally. We have some ideas too, which we hope to share with you, and on
which we shall need much help.
Please get in touch with one of us soon.

U.S. policy in Vietnam.

A source advised on December 19, 1967, that Sonia
Kaross, a member of the Oakland-Berkeley Branch of the
WFP, was planning on going to Washington, D.C. to attend
the proposed demonstration in that city on January 15, 1968.
SE T-11, 12/19/67
It is noted that Sonia Kaross
is also known as Sonia Baltrun.
Records of the Alameda County
Voters Registration reflect that Sonia
Baltrun in May, 1934, gave her political
preference as Communist.
On April 9, 1943, a source advised
that Sonia Baltrun openly bragged about
her membership in the CP and the fact
that she attended the first party con-
vention. This source also advised that
Sonia Baltrun was not a chartered member
of the CP, but was the holder of a very
low book number.

I am proud of the fact that my first vote cast in Congress was a vote against war.
It was the first opportunity for a woman to vote; because I was the first woman.
to be elected to Congress.
I believed then, as I do today, that women are the ones that must be concerned
with the needs, and, development of the human race. I have always fought for the
dignity of all human beings for those of the présent as well as those of future

Jeanette Rankin Brigade sets
January 15 for capitol action
-
SAN FRANCISCO. When
American women petition. the
joint session of Congress on its
opening day (Jan. 15) to end
the war in Vietnam, it will be
"the most important coalition
of women ever formed," Mrs.
Vivian Hallinan, executive sec-
retary of the Jeanette Rankin
Brigade, told a press conference
here last week.
"There will be women rep-
renting the clergy, scientists,
professionals, and leaders of
the civil rights movement,” she
said. "The black clad women
will be led by Jeanette Rankin,
the country's first congress-
woman, who is now 80 years
old."
The people's leaders hope
enough women from the Bay
Area will join the brigade to
make a plane charter feasible.
Inquiries about the chartered
plane can be addressed to the
local office of the Brigade at
150 'Golden Gate avenue, S.F.
Tviephone 474-4456.
The. Brigade is now contact-
ing congressional leaders, ask-
"

"
ing them to meet the women
at the capitol steps to receive
their petition to put ending of
the war in Vietnam as the first
order of business for the new
Session of the Congress.
Program for the event, as
finalized, calls for presentation
to Congress of the Brigade's
demands (see PW Dec. 16) and
then holding of a women's con-
gress that afternoon to plan
political action on a local scale.
Unless Congress acts on their
petition, the women will use
Jan. 16 to see their representa-
tives and pressure them to sup-
port their demands.
"We are not going to do any-
thing unconstitutional," Mrs.
Hallinan said. "We are going to
petition Congress for redreas of
grievances. There was agree-
ment at a meeting of the na-
tional steering committed to
give Congress three more
months to act. After that wo
will take to the streets there
was agreement on this by all
those concerned."

The women plan to convene
a Congress of American Women

Besides demanding that the

the women will demand that

Dear Friend:
We are sending this letter to you and others from whom we have not heard much
recently, in the hope of re-enlisting your efforts in the Women for Peace
movement. It has been too long since we last heard directly from many of you,
and our meetings with those of you whom we have seen recently have been brief.
Of course, we know the paralyzing sense of frustration we all feel occasionally,
as we learn of the mounting horrors in Vietnam. But this feeling is only
temporary, and quickly gives way to activity. As women, we bear the major
responsibility for the preservation of life, and thus a major responsibility
in the peace movement.
Enclosed you will find an announcement of the latest national women's effort
for peace. Several peace groups in Portland are cooperating in raising funds
to send representatives to Washington. We hope that you will also support this
effort, to insure representation from Portland Women for Peace.
The coupon
on the enclosed notice is for your use in this effort.
i
In addition, we will have a supportive peaceful demonstration
in Portland at

We are asking participants to wear black, and to bring a black
(or dark colored) umbrella. We shall carry the umbrellas opened,
rain or shine. Placards (to wear) and leaflets (to distribute),
expressing support for the Jeannette Rankin Brigade, will be
available. We shall march around the Post Office block for one hour,
from noon to 1 p.m., leafleting as we walk.
We hope, if you cannot go to Washington, yourself, that you will contribute to
help someone else to go, and that you will also join with us at the Pioneer
Fost Office at noon Monday, January 15th.
In addition, please let us hear from you on your ideas of what more we might
do locally. We have some ideas too, which we hope to share with you, and on
which we shall need much help.
Please get in touch with one of us soon.

November 27, 1967 ·
I am proud of the fact that my first vote cast in Congress was a vote against war.
It was the first opportunity for a woman to vote, because I was the first woman
to be elected to Congress.
I believed then, as I do today, that women are the ones that must be concerned
with the needs, and. development of the human race. I have always fought for the
dignity of all human beings for those of the prosent as well as those of future
generations.

SAN FRANCISCO
--
When
Congress reconvenes in Jan-
uary, the opening session will
· be met with the demand that
its first order of business must
be ending the Vietnam war
and the withdrawal of Ameri-
can troops from Southeast Asia.
This demand will be pres-
ented by woman power, organ-
ized into the Jeanette Rankin
Brigade.
The women plan to convene
fa Congress of American Women
to develop programs "dedicated
to reshaping American society
and restoring our country to
the con.munity of nations."
Besides demanding that the
legislators act to end the war,
the women will demand that
Congress:
Use its power to heal a sick
ciety at home;
• Use its power to make re-
parations for the ravaged land
we leave behind in Vietnam;
• Listen to what the Ameri-
vin people are saying and re-
1 fuse the insatiable demands of
the military-industrial complex.
This movement was inspired
by an appeal by Jeanetto Ran-
kin, SC, the nation's first woman
. Congress. elected in 1917.
It we had 10,000 women will-
ng to go to prison if necessary,"
theid in May, "that would
on it. You cannot have wars
without the women."
.
Miss Rankin, a militant lead-
er of the suffragette movement
that eventually gained women
the right to vote under the
19th Amentit, voted in 1917
against U.S. involvement in
World War I and also oppose
American military commitment
In World War II.
"
"This is no time to be po-
bte,” Miss Rankin said. “The
army isn't polite when it se-
kets a young man and says
*come and fight'. But they don't
take the politicians and deci-
on makers to fight.”
Miss Rankin's militant oppo-
tion to the Vietnam war was
taken up by about 75 prominent
2omen throughout the coun-
-
nationwide convening of the
Jeanette Rankin Brigade

Washington.
in
Women for Peace and the
Women's Intl. League for Peace
and Freedom have rallick to
support of the action and a
drive is now underway to get
the largest possible number of
women to Washington for the
joint opening session of Con-
gress.
Supportive action by women
who cannot go to Washington
will be planned in various loca-
lities.
One facet of the Congress of
American Women will be dis-
cussion of electoral action, says
Nikki Bridges, San Francisco
chairman of the brigade.
"Many of us feel we should
support peace candidates where
they exist and go into politics
ourselves in other places, de-
cause that way you get a forum
you don't otherwise have," she
says.
At present efforts are being
made to get support from as

W.E.B. DU BOIS CLUBS OF AMERICA (DCA)
A source advised that on October 26-27, 1963, a con-
ference of members of the Communist Party, USA (CPUSA), including
national functionaries, met in Chicago, Illinois, for the purpose
of setting in motion forces for the establishment of a new national
Marxist -oriented youth organization which would hunt for the most
peaceful transition to socialism. The delegates were told that it
would be reasonable to assume that the young socialists attracted
into this new organization would eventually pass into the CP
itself.
A second source has advised that the founding convention
for the new youth organization was held from June 19-21, 1964,
at 150 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, California, at which
time the name W.E.B.DuBois Clubs of America (DCA) was adopted.
Approximately 500 delegates from throughout the United States
attended this convention.
The second source advised in September, 1966, that MIKE
ZAGARELL, CPUSA Youth Director, stated that in Negro communities
the Party still supported the plan to build "left" socialist
centers and to solidify the Party base through the DCA.. This
scurce also advised in September, 1966 that DANIEL RUBIN, CPUSA
National Organizational Secretary, stated the Party believes.
the DCA should have a working-class outlook and be a mass organiz-
ation favorable to socialism, socialist countries and Marxism,
and in April, 1967, advised GUS HALL, CPUSA General Secretary,
had indicated the DCA primary emphasis should be on developing
mass resistance to the draft.
A third source advised in September, 1967, that JARVIS
TYNER was elected chairman of the DCA on September 10, 1967, at
the Third National Convention of the DCA held in New York, New
York, from September 8-10, 1967.
A fourth source advised during August, 1967, that JARVIS
TYNER is a member of the National Committee of the CPUSA.
A fifth source advised on September 21, 1967, that the
headquarters of the DCA is located at 34 West 17th Street, New
York, New York.

advocating the withdrawal of American troops from
Vietnam and the money being utilized to carry on
the war in Vietnam be used to fight poverty in the
United States, provide better jobs in the ghetto, and
provide more welfare benefits for the under-privileged

,
Source three advised on March 3, 1966 that the Women's
International League for Peace and Freedom is a peace-
oriented womens' organization which is 'Anti-War'
per se. In addition, they work superficially in
regards to civil rights issues. The participants
are primarily active church-goers with a few former
Communist Party members. Women's International
League for Peace and Freedom's activities have included
demonstrations and distribution of literature opposing
the Vietnam war.
Source one described the Santa Ana Peace Center, Long
Beach Peace Center, and Individuals Against the Crime
of Silence as peace-oriented organizations in the Los
Angeles area who advocate the withdrawal of all American
troops from Vietnam.

and other women making the trip will pay all their own
expenses.
No expenses are contemplated while the women are
in Washington, D.C. inasmuch as arrangements have been made
for the women to stay with other WSP members in the
Washington, D.C. area. Source one advised that it is
contemplated all the women will stay in Washington, D.C. until
Tuesday, January 16, 1967.
Source one advised it was reported the women from
across the nation would gather at the Union Depot, Washington, D.C.
at 11:30 A.M. on January 15, 1968. Source one further reported
it is hoped ten thousand women will participate in the
demonstration. After the gathering at Union Depot, the women
will march in solemn procession, all wearing black, to the
steps of the capitol building where the petition containing
the redress of grievances will be presented to the Congress.
Source one further advised it had been reported that Representative
Mc Cormick and Senator Mansfield had agreed to receive the
petition. Representative Mc Cormick, according to source one,
had agreed to accept fifteen women in his office at which time
he would receive the petition, but source one advised the
JRB now wants Representative Mc Cormick and Senator Mansfield
to accept the petition on the steps of the capitol building
in order that they might get news coverage. After the petition
has been presented, the JRB wants the redress of grievances
read into the Congressional Record.
Further activities of the JRB while in Washington, D.C.
are to include a three hour "Women's Congress", possibly on the
grounds of Georgetown University.
Mary Clarke pointed out that although the original
intention had been to have only those women participate
in the JRB who were willing to risk arrest for civil disobedience,
she stated at the above meeting that no civil disobedience is
anticipated in view of the large number of organizations
participating who are opposed to such civil disobedience.
However, she further stated that individuals are not going to
be discouraged who might elect to create civil disobedience.

Source one advised that Joyce Angus is on the Executive
Committee of WSP. ·
Source three advised in July, 1955, that Mary Clarke
was dropped from Los Angeles County Communist Party
(LACCP) in the Spring of 1955 for personal reasons
and not for any political differences with LACCP.
Source one further reported that Glory Roberts of
Pacoima, California, who is editor of the "Social Action
Communicator", a monthly publication located in Pacoima,
California, recording secretary of the Peace Action Council (PAC)
(See Appendix), and representative to the PAC from the Black
Congress and vice versa, was selected as Chairwoman of a JRB
committee to reach into the black community to get participants
from the Black ghetto involved in the demonstration in
Washington, D.C. on January 15, 1968. Source one advised that
in order to do this, all the organizations comprising the
JRB will have to pledge money to get the women to Washington, D.C.
and back to Los Angeles, California.
Source one stated that three committees have been
established within the JRB. One of these committees has
been established to draw up a list of redress of grievances.
Each branch of the JRB throughout the nation will, when
gathered in Washington, D.C. as a main committee, decide
the major grievances and the redress of grievances will be
incorporated into a petition to be presented to Congress.
The second committee will be to involve the people in the
black community in the demonstration. The third committee is
to act as a coordinating committee.
Source one further advised it was reported that
the women from Southern California will leave by plane on
Sunday, January 14, 1968 at approximately 10:00 A.M., arriving
Washington, D.C. at approximately 6:00 P.M. on the same date.
No definite information was available yet regarding the
airlines on which the women would be flying.

received from pledges, some individuals will pay part of
their expenses with the remainder coming from the pledges,

COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF THE
FIRST UNITARIAN CHURCH OF LOS ANGELES
A source advised on May 22, 1967, that the
premises of the First Unitarian Church of Los Angeles, 2936
West 8th Street, Los Angeles, California, have been utilized
for meetings by Communist Party members and sympathizers over
a period of years. Speakers and lecturers at the church
frequently espouse Communist causes or follow the Communist
Party line. Communist front group literature is distributed
at the church. The church is used by some Communist Party
members for 'mass concentration" work.
"
This same infiltration extends to adjuncts of
the church such as the Unitarian Public Forum and the Fellow-
ship for Social Justice, formerly known as the Unitarian-
Universalist Fellowship for Social Justice.
STEPHEN H. FRITCHMAN has been minister of the
church since 1948.
Reverend STEPHEN H. FRITCHMAN is described in
the Fourth Report, Un-American Activities Committee in
California, 1948, page 115, as a very active "Communist
fronter" and connected with numerous "Communist front organi-
zations and activities.
Membership in the First Unitarian Church does not,
of itself, connote membership in or sympathy with the Communist
Party.

APPENDIX'
COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF THE
WOMEN STRIKE FOR PEACE,
Also Known As
Women's International Strike for Peace
A source advised on May 14, 1967, that the Women
Strike for Peace (WSP) in the Southern California area began
its operations in the late "all of 1961, as an affiliate
of the national organization formed in Washington, D.C.
is a peace oriented women's organization which is opposed
to the present American foreign policy in Vietnam. It has
also sought legislation which would bring about the abolition
of the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HCUA). In
recent months the organization has sponsored demonstrations
protesting the United States involvement in Vietnam and
calling for the complete withdrawal of all United States
troops from Vietnam. In the spring of 1966, it was instrumental
in originating and putting into effect a campaign advocating
support for "peace candidates" in the upcoming 1966 Congressional
elections.
The same source stated that WSP is a non-membership
organization and has no officers. The organization is open
to women of all political opinions who are interested in world
peace. It makes no effort to exclude from its activities
members of, or persons sympathetic to, the Communist Party
and related groups.
The guiding force behind the Southern California
W3F groups is MARY CLARKE. A second source advised in July,
1955, that CLARKE was dropped from the Western Division, Los
Angeles County Communist Party (LACCP) in the Spring of 1955,
for personal reasons and not because of any political differences
with the LACCP..
The first source advised that Southern California
WSP maintains its office at 5899 West Pico Boulevard, Los
Angeles. It receives mail through Post Office Box 19739,
Los Angeles 19, California.

WOMEN FOR LEGISLATIVE ACTION
A source advised on May 1, 1963, that the Women
for Legislative Action was formed in 1952, claiming to be
an independent organization dedicated to non-partisan parti-
cipation in legislative and civic activities. Its position
in favoring or opposing legislation usually parallels the
position of the Communist Party and related groups. It also
supports legislation to abolish the House Committee on Un-
American Activities. Membership in the Women for Legislative
Action does not, of itself, connote membership in or sympathy
with the Communist Party.
Another source advised on May 11, 1967, that the
Women fc: Legislative Action continues to be active in the
Los Angeles area.

E
A source advised that on October 26-27, 1963, a con-
ference of members of the Communist Party, USA (CPUSA), including
national functionaries, met in Chicago, Illinois, for the purpose
of setting in motion forces for the establishment of a new national
Marxist-oriented youth organization which would hunt for the most
peaceful transition to socialism. The delegates were told that it
would be reasonable to assume that the young socialists attracted
into this new organization would eventually pass into the CP
itself.
À second source has advised that the founding con-
vention for the new youth organization was held from June 19-21,
1964, at 150 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, California, at

adopted. Approximately 500 delegates from throughout the United
States attended this convention.
The second source advised in September, 1966, that
Mike Zagarell, CPUSA Youth Director, stated that in Negro
communities the Party still supported the plan to build "left"
socialist centers and to solidify the Party base through the
DCA. This sce also advised in September, 1966, that Daniel
Rubin, CPUSA National Organizational Secretary, stated the Party.
believes the DCA should have a working-class outlook and be a mass
organization favorable to socialism, socialist countires and
Marxism, and in April, 1967, advised that Gus Hall, CPUSA General
Secretary, indicated the DCA primary emphasis should be on
developing mass resistance to the draft.
A third source advised in September, 1967, that Jarvis
Tyner was elected chairman of the DCA on September 10, 1967, at the
Inird National Convention of the DCA held in New York, New York,
from September 8-10, 1967.
A fourth source advised during August, 1967, that Jarvis
Tyner is a member of the National Committee of the CPUSA.
A. fifth source advised on September 21, 1967, that the
headquarters of the DCA is located at 34 West 17th Street, New
York, New York.

Kinley Jones, Reporter for WSB Television Station,
Atlanta, Georgia, advised on December 28, 1967, that during
an interview with Jeannette (Rankin at Watkinsville, Georgia,
on December 26, 1967, she stated she intended to lead the
proposed march of women in Washington, D.C. on January 15,
1968, at which time they would march to the capitol building
and present a petitition for redress of grievances to John
McCormack, Speaker of the House of Representatives. Rankin
stated she had received a telegram from Mr. McCormack inform-
ing her he would be glad to greet them. Rankin explained that
Mrs. Vivian Hallinan of San Francisco, California, informed
her sometime ago that a group of women had formed an organiza-
tion called the "Jeannette Rankin Brigade", and asked her if
she would be the honorary president of the organization, at
which time she informed them she would be delighted to serve.
Rankih stated she was asking women to express ideas against
the institution of war and that she was opposed to the use of
violence to settle any dispute.
VIVIAN HALLINAN
A source advised on October 31, 1962, that
Terence Hallinan, the son of Vivian Hallinan,
stated in October, 1962, that his mother would
be willing to join the CP if her husband,
Vincent Hallinan, would also join.

Captain Robert Krahling, United States Capitol
Police, advised on January 3, 1968, that a delegation from
the JRB and their attorney, Joseph Forer, met with officials
of the United States Capitol Police on January 2, 1968,
concerning details of the proposed demonstration. These
individuals were advised by the United States Capitol Police
that they cannot demonstrate on the Capitol grounds in
a group or carry placards, as such activity is prohibited
by rules of Congress. Forer, as attorney for the group,
advised the officials that these women will be coming to
the Capitol as individuals and although they will be walking
together they can only be kept out of the Capitol building
if the police exclude all visitors from the United States
Capitol. Forer argued that such a demonstration on the
Capitol grounds is not a violation of the law by the
participants but a violation of the United States Government
in refusing to allow its citizens to present their grievances
to Congress.
Captain Krahling advised that in addition to
Joseph Forer, the members of the above delegation included
the following individuals:
indivi
Dagmar Wilson
Sylvia Lichtenstein
Donna Allen
Billie Hetzel
A third source, who has furnished
reliable information in the past,
advised in September, 1959, that a
member of the National Committee of
the Communist Party, USA, had recently
referred to Joseph Forer as "one of
the most important communist in
Washington, D.C."

that the Regional Office of the JRB is located at 3306 Ross

Donna Allen. He stated that the area representative of the
JRB is Wilhelmina Hetzel, 3625 Yuma Street, N.W., Washington,
D.C..
Inspector Herlihy stated that Mrs. Hetzel had recently
advised him that twenty coach loads of individuals from
New York City will leave New York City via Pennsylvania
Railroad at 7:20 a.m. January 15, 1968, and arrive in
Washington, D.C., at 11:10 a.m. From Union Station, they
will march to the United States Capitol where they will
visit Congress and the offices of various Congressmen.
Between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. they expect to hold a "Congress
of American Women" possibly at the D.C. Armory. According
to Inspector Herlihy, the New York group will leave Union
Station at 7:10 p.m. to return to New York City.

A confidential source, who has furnished reliable
information in the past, advised on January 4, 1968, that
the Jeannette Rankin Brigade (JRB) with headquarters at
133 West 72nd Street, New York City, originally scheduled
a demonstration in Washington, D.C. on January 8, 1968, to
coincide with the opening of Congress. In view of the
fact that the reconvening of Congress was delayed until
January 15, 1968, the organization rescheduled the
demonstration for that date. The source stated that the
JRB is composed mostly of members of Women Strike for
Peace, a pacifist organization and is using the name of
the JRB only for this one affair.
The above source stated that individuals are to.
meet at Union Station in Washington, D.C., at approximately
11:30 a.m. on January 15, 1968, and then walk in a "silent
procession" to the United States Capitol. Literature sent
out by the local office of Women Strike for Peace indicate
that the women will assemble at Union Station at the above
time and "in solemn procession and wearing black, we will
walk to the Capitol steps behind our delegation who will
present our '"Women's Petition to the Congress"' demanding
redress of grievances."
According to the source, the group wanted to have
Speaker of the House McCormick and Senator Mansfield meet
them on the Capitol steps and accept the above mentioned
petition. Thereafter, the women would visit both the Senate
and the United States House of Representatives and confer

WOMEN FOR PEACE aka
Women Strike for Peace
The "Berkeley Daily Gazette," a daily newspaper of
general circulation published in Berkeley, California,
contained an article in the November 19, 1965, evening
edition reflecting that in November, 1961, when con-
cern mounted over radioactive fallout from nuclear
testing, a group of women in Washington, D. C. started
Women Strike for Peace. The idea spread rapidly through-
out the country and now embraces 900 groups, including
Women For Peace groups in the San Francisco Bay area.
These groups support programs to achieve goals such as:
Continued disarmament negotiations.

(2)
(3)
A strong and flexible United Nations.
Planning now at state and national levels for
conversion to peace-time economy and positive
efforts to ease world tensions.
The women act as individuals and as a group, with specific
actions suggested by individuals and groups from all over
the world. Decision to participate jointly on any given
suggestion is democratly arrived at by members of the Co-
ordinating Committee. Effective cooperation with other
peace groups is encouraged. Monthly Coordinating Committee
meetings and general meetings, as warranted, are open to
all and announced in mailings to members. There are no
dues or membership forms nor conditions for membership.
To stir an awareness of the need for peace, Women For
Peace encourage public education in peace objectives at
local schools and sponsor peace-oriented demonstrations
and public meetings, newspaper ads, billboards, and
candidates for public office. On the national level
the group attempts to influence government officials
by letters and conferences.

upon whom the communist leaders were at that
time.

Georgia, on the evening of January 4, 1968, and Mrs.
Martin Luther King, Jr., National Sponsor of the
Jeannette Rankin Brigade, would also speak at the

to the article, Isobel Cerney, Founder of the Southern
Coordinating Committee to End the War in Vietnam, would
be on the program at Ebenezer Baptist Church.
ISOBEL FORBES CERNEY
A source on August 25, 1961, advised
that a meeting of the Palo Alto Communist
Club, Palo Alto, California, was held on
August 23, 1961, and that $36.00 was turned
over in this meeting as an up-to-date payment
of Communist Party dues for Isobel and Edwin H.
Cerney.
The source also advised on September 18,
1961, that a close friend was trying to have
Isobel Cerney kicked out of the Communist
Party because of her present religion "jag"
and because she did not attend Communist Party
meetings regularly when visiting Palo Alto
during the Summers.
The source further advised on August 28,
1962, that Isobel and Edwin H. Cerney were
then out of the Communist Party, although the
$25.00 received for their current dues was to
be retained by the Party.

A source advised on May 9, 1967, that it was his
understanding that the National Lawyers Guild (NLG) was
formed around 1936 in New York City, and that the Chicago
Chapter of the NLG (CCNLG), which is affiliated with the
national group in New York, was formed shortly thereafter;
possibly in 1937 by a group of liberal progressive lawyers
in protest against activities of the American Bar Association
which they claimed was a non-liberal, non-progressive
organization. The CCNLG has no established headquarters but
occasionally uses the return address of its officials in
literature.

In January, 1966, a fourth source advised that the
CCASR went out of existence in the Spring of 1965 due to the
health condition of MANDEL A. TERMAN. The offices of the
CCASR, formerly located at 32 West Randolph Street, Chicago,
were for a short time carried at MANDEL TERMAN's home resi-
dence, 660 West Irving Park Road, Chicago. During the Fall
of 1965 due to the defunctness of the CCASR, the CP of Illinois
found it necessary to sponsor a rally honoring the 48th
anniversary of the Russian Revolution under a temporary
committee called "The Chicago Committee for American-Soviet
Friendship Rally." This rally was held on November 7, 1965,
and once the rally was held this temporary committee went
out of existence.
The fourth source advised that as of the present
time the CCASR is defunct in the Chicago area and any future
rally to be held on the American-Soviet friendship theme will
have to be organized by the CP of Illinois on a temporary
basis.
The NCA SF has been designated pursuant to Executive
Order 10450.

The "Guide to Subversive Organizations and Publications"

"1. Cited as a Communist front.

CHICAGO COUNCIL OF AMERICAN-SOVIET
RELATIONS, Formerly known as Chicago
Council of American-Soviet Friendship
EDWIN GORDON, FOX, 7147 Jeffrey Avenue, Chicago,
Illinois, (now deceased) made available in January, 1954, the
"First Annual Report CCASF," an undated publication which
stated that the Chicago Council of American-Soviet Friendship
(CCASF) was incorporated in July, 1943. This document stated,
"The Council's affiliation with the National Council of
American-Soviet Friendship (NCASF) was validated August 11,
(1943). The present name was adopted to conform to standard
national practice. It should be noted, however, that the
Chicago Council is entirely autonomous; the government of its
affairs rests exclusively in the hands of its Chicago Executive
Board."
On April 8, 1965, a source furnished information to
the effect that as of March 11, 1965, this organization would
be known as the Chicago Council of American-Soviet Relations
(CCASR). MANDEL TERMAN continued to be listed as Chairman of
the new organization.
During April, 1965, a second source advised that
MANDEL TERMAN had arbitrarily dissolved the Board of Directors,
assumed all financial and other functions of the organization,
and was maintaining existing records of the organization at
his residence, 660 West Irving Park Road, Chicago, Illinois.
The aims and purposes of this organization continued to be
to work for peaceful coexistence and friendship with the USSR.
While it claimed to be an autonomous organization, its program
followed the NCASF and it was in frequent contact with the
NCASF.
On November 5, 1958, a third source advised that in
the early 1940s, MANDEL TERMAN was a member-at-large of the
Communist Party (CP) of Illinois. TERMAN was in Russia in
November, 1958, where he had gone to discuss the treatment of
Jews and to discuss Jewish culture in the USSR with the
leadership of the Soviet Union.

TO ALL AMERICAN WOMEN,
November 27, 1967
I am proud of the fact that my first vote cast in Congress
was a vote against war. It was the first opportunity for a
woman to vote because I was the first woman to be elected
to Congress.
I believed then as I do today that women are the ones who
must be concerned with the needs and development of the
human race. I have always fought for the dignity of all
human beings for those of the present as well as those
of future generations.
I will continue to struggle as long as I live.
I hope all women will respond to the following CALL, and
join me in Washington on January 8, 1968, the opening
day of Congress.
With highest hopes,

A CALL TO AMERICAN WOMEN
who are outraged by the ruthless slaughter in Vietnam
and the persistent neglect of human needs at home
TO COME TO WASHINGTON JANUARY 15. & 16
16
AMERICAN WOMEN constitute 51% of the voting population, yet a high percentage of us don't vote. ·
It is time for women to break out of their societal molds and take their place as effective, vocal citi-
zens. WOMEN CAN ELECT the President they want; Women can determine the political, social and
economic direction of the nation. WE HAVE WOMEN POWER. Let's use it to demonstrate our
opposition to this war to the Congress of the United States.
We are a broad coalition of women from many areas of American life. We shall meet in Washington
on January 15 for the opening of Congress to demand the following:
1.
2.
Nim
3.
4.
* !
CONGRESS, AS ITS FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS, RESOLVE TO END THE
WAR IN VIETNAM AND IMMEDIATELY ARRANGE FOR THE WITHDRAWAL
OF ALL AMERICAN TROOPS.
CONGRESS USE ITS POWER TO HEAL A SICK SOCIETY AT HOME.
CONGRESS USE ITS POWER TO MAKE REPARATION FOR THE RAVAGED
LAND WE LEAVE BEHIND IN VIETNAM.
CONGRESS LISTEN TO WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE SAYING AND
REFUSE THE INSATIABLE DEMANDS OF THE MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL
COMPLEX.
After we petition the United States Congress, we will hold our own congress to articulate our position
on the basic problem of achieving peace. We declare our intention to return to our communities and
mobilize women to dedicate ourselves to reshaping American society, and restoring our country to a
position of honor in the community of nations.
On January 15, we will meet at the Union Depot in Washington, D.C., at 11:30 A.M., and walk behind
our delegation which will present our petition to the U.S. Congress.
On January 16, many of us will stay in Washington to begin implementation of these demands by
presenting them to our Congressmen and Senators. We hope you can stay.

In view of instructions set forth in Bureau
memorandum 10-73, dated 3/6/73, paragraph G, wherein the
Bureau reiterated its policy that the FBI has no interest
in individuals and organizations involved in legitimate
dissent and the recent United States Supreme Court decision
upholding the right to abortion, it appears continued
investigation of WONAAC as such is not justified.
The New York Office further concurs with the
Philadelphia view that continued investigation of the SWP
and/or YSA would produce the desired cover age and information
concerning its members who are associated or active in WONAAC.
UACB, the New York Office is closing the investigation
of this organization.

Re New York letter to the Bureau, 6/6/72; Bureau 0-7
to New York, 7/12/72; and Philadelphia letter to the Bureau,
2/28/73.
C
As outlined in referenced New York letter, the
New York Office noted, as far back as June, 1972, it
recognized that, although several leaders of WONAAC were
known to be SWP members, their activities, as pertaining to
WONAAC, had been directed toward the legal repeal of all
restrictive abortion laws, and investigation had disclosed
no indication that WONAAC, as an organization, had engaged in
any subversive or vidence prone activity.
Referenced Bureau 0-7, referencing the aforementioned
communication, nevertheless instructed that the New York Office,
as office of origin, had overall responsibility for captioned.
organization, and directed the New York Office to reopen its
case and submit semi-annual reports.
66.
A review of the results of the continuing investigation
of WONAAC, together with all indices and references pertaining
thereto, since June 1972, reflects no apparent change in the
activities or the organization or its membership from that
outlined above.
The New York Office is in accord with the view of the
Philadelphia Division, as set forth in its referenced letter,
that WONAAC represents basically a social change vehicle which,
despite disparate political views of its leaders and membership,
deals with the single issue of abortion rights.

ORGANIZATION OF BOSTON WOMEN'S
ABORTION ACTION COALITION (BOWAAC)
BOWAAC, the local affiliate of the
Women's National Abortion Action
Coalition (WONAAC), was formed out
of the local Female Liberation group;
and while BOWAAC is not exclusively
made up of Socialist Workers Party
(SWP), Boston, and Young Socialist
Alliance of Boston (YSA-B) female
members, it is controlled by members
of those groups.
WONAAC has been publicly described
as an organization of groups whose
aim is to effect the overthrow of
existing abortion laws and to demand
free abortion on demand.
The SWP, Boston, is the local affiliate
and follows the aims and purposes of
the national SWP.
The SWP has been designated pursuant
to Executive Order 10450.
The YSA-B is the Boston affiliate
of the YSA, the youth organization
of the SWP.
A. Headquarters
In late summer, 1972, BOWAAC moved its headquarters
from 552 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, Mass., to
419 Boylston Street, Room 323, Boston, Massachusetts,
telephone 266-3574.

The New England Telephone 1973 Directory for
the Boston area lists BOWAAC at 419 Boylston Street,
Boston, with telephone numbers 266-3574 and 266-1679.
B. Membership and SWP and YSA Infiltration
BOWAAC is not a formal membership-type group.
There are, however, currently a limited number of activists,
a maximum of fifteen, the majority of whom are members of
the SWP and/or YSA in the Boston area, involved in BOWAAC
work. The number of activists is currently limited as
a number of the formerly active independents in the group
have recently dropped out of BOWAAC work feeling that
the United States Supreme Court decision relaxing legal
restraints on the practice of abortion has resolved the
abortion problems.

Re:
National Women's Political Caucus (NWPC)
Policy Council Meeting
Source, who has furnished reliable information in the
past, provided the following information on July 3, 1972:
A Policy Council Meeting of the National Women's
Political Caucus (NWPC) was held in Washington, D.C. during
the period June 24, 1972 - June 25, 1972.
The NWPC is a legitimate, loosely-knit, open
organization of politically motivated women
seeking equal recognition in the American
community.
During the Policy Council Meeting there were no
overt attempts by any organized group to influence the policy
meeting and there were no individuals present who identified
themselves as members of any organization which might be construed
as subversive and/or supporting any cause except legitimate
change.
Of significance, however, was the fact that literature
of the Women's National Abortion Action Coalition (WONAAC) was
present in brochures and pamphlets located throughout the meeting
area. All of the WONAAC material was geared to the abortion
movement and specifically the WONAAC conference scheduled for

Re:
NWPC Policy Council Meeting
As the youth organization of the SWP, the
YSA serves as the main source of recruitment into
that organization. The YSA is described in the
masthead of its official publication, "The Young
Socialist Organizer," as "a multinational
revolutionary socialist youth organization.
During the council meeting on June 24, 1972, Mary
Clarke, who is associated with the Southern California WPC,
an affiliate of the NWPC; advised a group of policy council
members that WONAAC had been using the Southern California WPC
name as an endorser of WONAAC. Clarke also stated that WONAAC
had passed out propaganda at a caucus rally in California and
were very effective at taking control of small gatherings.
The Chairwoman from Nassau County in New York, whose
name was not recalled, defended WONAAC stating that "they were
a good group". This woman's position was not supported and,
in general, WONAAC literature was not accepted by those persons
present. Jill Ruckelshaus, a new member of the Policy Council,
is reportedly concerned about the SWP's attempts to align
itself with the abortion movement and will be using her newly
gained position to fight SWP attempts at control of local
WPC groups.
The NWPC organizing brochure published by the NWPC
has been written to assist individual WPC groups in organizing.
The brochure lists political parties and para-political
organizations to be contacted by caucus organizers when forming
the nucleus of a WPC. Among those listed was the SWP. After
discussions at the caucus it was determined that the SWP should
be removed from the list. The new edition of the WPC organizing
brochure will not list the SWP; it has been replaced by National
Peace Action Coalition (NPAC).
The NPAC was founded in 1970 by members of the SWP.
Its basic objective is to unite masses of people
including labor unions, GIs, and the black
community in the struggle to end United States
intervention in Southeast Asia through orderly and
peaceful tactics.

The Women's National Abortion
Action Coalition
Confidential sources one, two and three, all of
whom have furnished reliable information in the past, advised
on July 18, 19, and 20, 1972, respectively, that a Women's
National Abortion Action Coalition (ONAMC) Conference was
held at Hunter College, Park Avenue and 69th Street, on
July 15 and 16, 1972.
Confidential source number one advised that
New York City was picked for the site of this convention
because this city is considered to be the center of the most
powerful anti-abortion effort so far.
The WONAAC Conference was open to all women
who supported the Abortion Law Repeal Movement. Registration
was $3.00 per person. Housing and child care facilities were
available. There were approximately 800 women in attendance
at this conference.
Discussions held at this conference centered on
plans for (one)-future activity in the campaign to repeal
all anti-abortion and contraception laws and (two) to end
forced sterilization.
A discussion was held concerning the attacks
being made by the Catholic Church Hierarchy and other
anti-abortion groups against women's rights to their
own bodies.
*
WONAAC is aware of the fact that progress for
these matters will not come easy, that it will be fought by
various groups step by step all the way, therefore, this
conference was called to discuss all the different approaches
and to decide on the major direction for WONAAC to take..

N.Y
In defense of the SWP-YSA position at the
conference, Linda Jenness, the SWP Presidential candidate,
spoke in behalf of the YSA-SWP. In answer to Rose Weber's
accusation, Jenness stated that all members of the YSA-SWP
were independent individuals with their own personal ideas
and viewpoints.
On July 15, 1972, a proposal was passed by the
Election Workshop which stated in part as follows:
"WOMAAC welcomes women from all political
affiliations and views. We are united in action to
win our demands guaranteeing women the right to control.
our own reproduction functions.
"By uniting women of all political views we
maximize our strength. Any attempt to impose one political
view on everyone in WONAAC would only destroy our ability to
fight together on the abortion question. Therefore WONAAC,
as an organization takes no position on any candidates or
political parties....
*
51
"The political rallies which will no doubt take
place with increasing frequency around the country as
November approaches offer us a forum for getting our ideas
across to great numbers of women. Besides allowing us an
opportunity to force the candidates to take a public stand
on abortion, these gatherings give us a chance to publicize
both WONAAC and the repeal campaign.

The Women's National Abortion

A National WONAAC structure proposal was
presented, which stated in part as follows:
Black,
'All women are welcome in WONAAC:
Latina, Chicana, Native American and Asian women, gay
women, high school, college, and working women, women
from political organizations, trade unions, the military,
and communities across the country. We are united in un-
compromising struggle for our common goal: the right of
all women to control fully their own reproductive lives...
"The National Conference shall be the highest
decision-making body of WONAAC, and shall operate on the
basis of one woman, one vote.
"There shall be a National Coordinating Committee
(NCC) composed of one woman from each national organization,
area coalition, and group supporting and building WONAAC...
thin ho
"There shall also be a Working Committee (WC),
which is a sub-committee of the NCC and which is composed
of the project directors or coordinators, the elected
national staff, and one woman from cach coalition, committee,
group and national organization supporting and building WONAAC
in the locale of the national office.
18
In addition to the above, a proposal "that the
National Office of the Women's National Abortion Action
Coalition establish an emergency cash fund, from which to
contribute significant amounts of money to organizations
and individuals who are working to achieve goals compatible
with those of WONAAC...
"
"That the National Office of WONAAC, as its first
act of financial support, pledge $2,000 to the Kennedy-Schulder
suit against the tax-exempt status of the Roman Catholic Church,
since the Church has violated restrictions on its political
activity by lobbying for anti-abortion legislation.

The Agenda for the conference followed the
proposed agenda ret forth by the Working Committee,
mentioned above, with the exception of a change in
the lunch hour and some of the workshop schodules.
Prior to the Saturday conference, a Socialist
Workers Party Young Socialist Alliance (SWP-ISA) Fraction
meeting was held at the Belmont Plaza Hotel on 49th Street
and Lexington Avenue at AM.
AM. Those in attendance at this
Faction meeting were SWP-YSA comrades from NYC and from
out of town. The discussion at this Faction meeting centered
on the procedure to be followed at the conference by the
YSA-SP members in terms of voting on various workshops and
what stand to take which would be more beneficial for the
YSA-SWP. This Faction meeting was concluded at approximately
9:30 PM.
FORMER MEMBER OF SUBJECT ORGANIZATION
NY.
The WONAAC Conference procedure continued
uninterrupted with votes on various floor discussions
until an interruption was made by Rose/Weber, a WONAAC
coordinator. She addressed all YSA-SWP members at the
conference, asking them what was their real reason for
being in attendance at the WONAAC Conference. She
accused the YSA-SWP of not being sincerely interested
in abortion rights, but rather being interested in what
was best for the SWP-YSA. She stated that because of
the YSA-SWP influence being enforced on the conference,
she was resigning as a ONAAC coordinator and staff member.
She stated that she detested the intervention of the YSA-SWP
in this conference; that the SWP-YSA has caused conflict among
the WONAAC staff and therefore, they cannot work out constructive
solutions to their problems. She also suggested that the "zero
Population" and planned parenthood have no voice in discussions
at this conference. Finalizing her accusations, she stated the
YSA-SWP members had no mind of their own nor did they have any
freedom of expression of their own. She stated that they only
