Section, Panama Canal,) regarding this matters
*It-has-been-reported-that Very frequently a B-26 airplane (N5546N - & Martin
Marauder) makes trips between Tocumen and David, R.P. It is piloted by
Steve MURRAY, and at least two other Americans ride on the plane, which is who ma
sometimes met at Tocumen Airport by either Tito, Harmodito or Toni ARIAS.
On landing at the airport it goes directly to a hangar, and allegedly the
only ones who visit it are the ARIAS brothers, PASTOR Ponce, Chief of the
hairport, and one (fnu) LINARES, Chief of Customs at Tocumen.
Informant stated that it was believed et first that the plane was engaged
in arms contraband, but later it appeared more logical to assume that it
was involved in another type of smuggling, poscibly drugs.

the U.S. Ambassador, stating that prior to arriving in Panama the plane had
beon signaled, that all was not well at the airport and that, the crew had
Jettisoned cargo prior to arrival. (A check with the Air Force authorities

9. The present status of the matter is that the plane has been searched with
nogative results, that the plane is still being held by the Panamanian authori-
ties and that MURRAY and others are endeavoring by every means possible to
secure the release of the plane. The hand of the Tocumen Airport, PASTOR Ponce,
has been dismissed and Toni ARIAS, the President's nephew, will probably be
allowed to withdraw from his position gracefully.)
