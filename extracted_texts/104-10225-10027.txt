Den svenska debatten är ensidig. Man har på ett

man drar ingen lärdom av utvecklingen i Allendes

i utvecklingen, annars kan man inte lära sig någonting.

NETHERLANDS
CHILEAN REFUGEES IN NETHERLANDS POINTED OUT AS FUGITIVES
Editorial by N. van Nieuwenhuysen;
Dutch, 19 April 1974, p 5
Reformatorisch Dagblad,
The Chilean refugees in the Netherlands seem to be
having adjustment problems. These rather prolonged symptoms
seem to be caused among other things by the fact that they
still find it hard to accept that the socialist dream of
their Marxist president. is definitely over and that their
country is now being ruled by a small group of reactionaries
who are trying to keep the people under control through
terrorism, repression, and torture. Such problems will take
you quite a ways in the Netherlands and those idealists were
quick to take advantage of it.
Welfare
What is the situation? Most of the approximately
250 refugees with a high school or university education do
not work. About half of them have been housed at the "Huis
ter Schie" in Overschie, where they enjoy the sunshine on
the terrace or play volleyball in the yard. Board and
lodging are free and at the end of the week they pick up
another 25 guilders pocket money. In addition they receive
free language instruction, commuter tickets for the bus, and
compensation for each trip they have to take.
Do you get the idea that they are better off than
many old people in the Netherlands? You are probably right,
because the Chilean exiles do not have to live on welfare;
they are being paid from the frozen funds which had been
allocated for development aid to their fatherland, Chile.
So you can see how well our tax money is being spent.

--- Image 104-10225-10027_page_107.jpeg ---
14-00000
Considering that this small group of pampered exiles
is preaching revolution even here and with a full stomach,
it may be useful to point out a few facts. These are facts
which are well known in the Ministry in The Hague but for
some reason never made it to the Netherlands press.
Facts
The great majority of the refugees are not even
Chilean nationals. They are natives of Bolivia, Brazil, and
Uruguay. They came to Chile as a result of illegal and
revolutionary activities in which they had been involved in
these South and Middle American countries, the ultimate
consequences of which they did not wish to suffer.
They felt at home in Allende's Chile because Allende
showed sympathy for their situation. His first action as
president, after his inauguration in November 1970, was to
declare amnesty for all those who "were members of terrorist
underground organizations," those who during the last months
of his predecessor's regime had been charged with bank
robbery, the armed robbery of self-service stores, the theft
of weapons from military arsenals, kidnapping, and attempted
murder.
The fact that some of those revolutionaries received
Chilean diplomatic status was due to Allende's policy of
granting residence permits to this type of revolutionaries.
These refugees with a high school or higher level education
seemed to have no adjustment problems in Chile. As a result
they soon found their way to important key positions in the
government.
"
The fugitives didn't suffer any sleepless nights in
Chile either, because they felt protected by a militant
Marxist army, armed to the teeth. Some 10,000 revolutionaries,
from all points of the compass, were at their disposal.

may be, one thing is certain the Chilean refugees were not
pursued only because of their ideology, their status, or
their origin. This is the traditional, humanitarian defini-
tion for a refugee. For the most part they are people who,
in their own country, could be legally charged with crimes
which are punishable under any judicial system.
These refugees carried out activities in Chilo which
were against the constitution. As a matter of fact, they are
specialists in violence. This is why they sought asylum in
the foreign embassies in Santiago and why there are so many
foreigners among them."

commerciele luchtverkeer en
scheepvaartverkeer op de St.-Law-
rence rivier in Canada zijn verlamd
door een staking die het land dage-
lijks enkele miljoenen dollars kost
De arbeidsrust duurt nu al meer
dan een week en zal volgens de Ca-
nadese parlementaire oppositie de
Inflatie, die momenteel jaarlijks 10
procent besiraagt, bevorderen.

Grote onrust onder
mijnwerkers in Z.-Afrika
JOHANNESBURG
-
In de afgelopen weken is moord en doodslag in de
Zuldafrikaanse goudmlinen onder de zwarte mijnwerkers tot een zorgbarende
omvang uitgegroeid. De jongste balans van bloedige stamtwisten tussen gast-
arbeiders uit Lesotho en de Xhosa's in de goudmijn Carletonville, bij Johannes-
burg, luidt: tien doden en drie en zestig gewonden.
De meeste slachtoffers waren gru-
welijk verminkt. Slaapplaatsen wer-
den vernield, met benzine overgoten
en in brand gestoken. Vluchtende
mijnwerkers zijn volgens ooggetuigen
doodgeschoten.
Tienduizend Baaho's hebben sinds
februari hun werkterrein in Zuid-
Afrika in de steek gelaten en zijn
naar hun veilige bergachtige väder-
land Lesotho teruggekeend. Vele an-
dere zijn van plan ook naar Lesotho
terug te gaan. Na de Basotho's vrezen
thans de niljnwerkers uit Malawi aan
de beurt te zijn.

Velen menen, dat ingewortelde
stammen-vijandschap de oorsaak is
van de onlusten. Daarbij komt dat bij
de huidige woningnood een nirge
aanleiding voldoende is om de haat
tegen de gastarbeiders tot een explo

pijen hebben zich tot dusver verzet
tegen de eis, de zwarte mijnwerkers
te groeperen naar de streken waar zij
vandaan komen. Zij menen, dat dan

RULING JUNTA (THUS BIG BOOST FOR UNSOBER/1), WE UNDERSTAND PINOCHET
HAS GRANTED OTHER INTERVIEWS AND ALLOWED FILMING ON DAWSON ISLAND.
PROPOSAL HAS BEEN CAREFULLY DISCUSSED WITH UNSOBER/3, AND HE HAS
SAID REPORTAGE WOULD BE FAVORABLE BUT NOT TOTALLY UNCRITICAL--BEST
TREATMENT THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT COULD HOPE FOR IN FRANCE.Y
3. TO OBTAIN INTERVIEW WITH GENERAL PINOCHET AND OTHER JUNTA
LEADERS AND/OR PERMISSION FILM CONDITIONS ON DAUSON ISLAND AND
ELSEWHERE IN CHILE, UNSOBER/1 HAS ASKED FOR BKHERALD ASSISTANCE.
UNSOBER/1 IS CONFIDENT THAT SUPERIORS WOULD APPROVE PROGRAM IF
UNSOBER/1 COULD ASSURE THEM THAT HE WOULD BE GRANTED INTERVIEWS, ETC.Y

INTERNATIONAL CRITICISM OF CHILEAN JUNTA AND MORE RECENTLY OF
BKHERALD HAVE BEEN ORCHESTRATED TO DRAMATIC PROPORTIONS. HQS BELIEVES
EFFECTIVE EXPLOITATION OF GENERAL PINOCHËT'S OFFER TO EXCHANGE A
NUMBER OF POLITICAL PRISONERS FOR AN EQUAL NUMBER OF SOVIET AND/OR
CUBAN PRISONERS IS OPPORTUNITY TO BLUNT HOSTILE PROPAGANDA. IF THE
USSR AND CHILE CAN BE LUMPED TOGETHER IN POPULAR MIND AS EACH HAVING
POLITICAL PRISONERS, THE SITUATION CAN BE EXPLOITED TO DIVERT SOME OF
ATTENTION FROM JUNTA'S SUPPOSED MISDEEDS TO SOVIET HANDLING OF
POLITICAL PRISONERS. A REPORT FROM A SENSITIVE SOURCE INDICATES THAT
THE SOVIETS AND CUBANS ARE CONCERNED OVER THE PRESSURES THAT COUBLD
DEVELOP FROM THE OFFER. 4
2.
THE EXCHANGE OFFER HAS ASPECTS THAT WOULD BE ATTRACTIVE TO.
NUMEROUS GROUPS IN EUROPE BUT THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE REACTION,
PROBABLY BECAUSE OF CHILE'S EXTREME UNPOPULARITY AND THE LACK OF BOTH
A NEUTRAL. SPONSOR AND SUFFICIENT PUBLICITY. EUROPEAN COMMUNISTS
SHOULD BE INTERESTED IN THE OFFER TO RELEASE IMPORTANT CHILEAN

2. THE OUTLOOK FOR CHILE IS CAUTIOUSLY OPTINISTIC. THE NEW
MILITARY GOVERNMENT HAS AVOIDED MAJOR INTERNAL CONFLICTS AND HAS
MOVED AGGRESSIVELY TO ‘REORGANIZE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES MORE
EFFICIENTLY, TO CREATE AN APOLITICAL CIVIL SERVICE, AND TO CORRECT
THE EXCESSES OF NEARLY THREE YEARS OF DECAPITALIZATION UNDER STATE
SOCIALISM. ITS ECONOMIC PROGRAMS, ALTHOUGH AUSTERE, ARE SOUND AND
OFFER A FIRM FOUNDATION FOR RECOVERY AND GROWTH OF THE CHILEAN
ECONOMY. THE STRICT SECURITY NEASURES ADOPTED BY THE JUNTA HAVE
BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN PREVENTING ANY LARGE-SCALE VIOLENCE OR TERRORISM
AND ARE LIKELY TO BE CONTINUED FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

CENTRAL BANK DEVALUED THE ESCUDO BY SOME 60% IN AN EFFORT TO CURB
IMPORT DEMAND AND EASE PRESSURES ON THE COUNTRY'S MEAGER FOREIGN
EXCHANGE RESERVES. AS A RESULT, CHILE'S COST OF LIVING JUMPED 88%
IN OCTOBER, AND OTHER PRICE RISES PUSHED INFLATION TO SOME 770%
FOR THE YEAR.

4. THE JUNTA HAS NOW AGREED TO FOLLOW THE STABILIZATION
PROGRAM PROPOSED BY AN IMF TEAM WHICH VISITED CHILE IN LATE 1974.
THIS PROGRAM CALLS FOR TIGHTER FEDERAL SPENDING AND FOR LIMITING
THIS IMF PROGRAM IS FEASIBLE BUT MAY .
INFLATION TO 100% IN 1974.
BE SOMEWHAT OVER-OPTIMISTIC, ESPECIALLY SINCE THE WORLD-WIDE ENERGY
CRISIS WILL SOON FORCE CHILE TO RAISE FUEL PRICES, THUS EXACCER-
BATING THE PROBLEM OF CONTROLLING INFLATION.
ADHERENCE TO THE IMF
PROPOSAL HAS, HOWEVER, IMPROVED CHILE'S COREDIT RATING, AS HAS THE
SIGNING OF A BILATERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE UNITED STATES ON CHILE'S
1971-1972 DEBT. CHILE IS THUS IN A RELATIVELY GOOD POSITION FOR
THE OPENING OF THE PARIS CLUB TALKS IN FEBRUARY.
THE MASSIVE $4
BILLION DOLLAR FOREIGN DEBT, HOWEVER, WILL CAUSE CHILE BALANCE OF
BALANCE-OF-PAYMENTS PROBLEMS FOR SOME TIME.

CIVILIAN ADVISERS TO ASSIST THE GOVERNMENT MINISTRIES.
PHENOMENON IS MOST APPARENT IN THE AREAS OF ECONOMIC POLICY AND IN

SUCH TECHNICAL FIELDS AS PUBLIC HEALTH AND HOUSING.
THE IMPORTANCE
OF THE GROUP OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS HEADED BY RAUL SAEZ, FOR EXAMPLE
IS WELL KNOWN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH HAS AN ADVISORY BOARD
DECOMINATED BY THE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, WHILE THE MINISTRY OF
HOUSING'S BOARD IS LARGELY CONTROLLED BY THE ORGANIZATION REPRESENT-
ING PRIVATE CONSTRUCTION FIRMS. SIMILARLY, ALMOST EVERY MINISTRY.
AND MANY AUTONOMOUS AGENCIES HAVE PERMANENT CIVILIAN ADVISORY
BOARDS COMPOSED OF REPRESENTATIVES OF GROUPS WHOSE WELFARE IS
AFFECTED BY THE AGENCY'S ACTIVITIES.

11. IN ADDITION TO THESE CIVILIAN ADVISORY BOARDS, THERE ARE A
LARGE NUMBER OF "STUDY COMMISSIONS" THROUGH WHICH CIVILIANS CAN
EXERT THEIR INFLUENCE. BEST KNOWN OF THESE IS THE GROUP IF INTER-
NATIONAL LAWYERS WHICH IS DRAFTING A NEW CONSTITUTION, BUT THERE
ARE OTHER GROUPS WORKING ON A NEW MINING CODE, STUDYING THE EDUCA-

SERVICEABLE VEHICLES. FARM OUTPUT, HOWEVER, IS NOT EXPECTED TO
RECOVER FULLY UNTIL THE 1974/75 HARVEST SO THAT AGRICULTURAL
IMPORTS, PARTICULARLY GRAIN, WILL CONTINUE TO BE A DRAIN ON CHILE'S

ENABLE IT TO PURCHASE CAPITAL GOODS AND FINANCE THE CURRENT PAY-

9.
INTERNALLY, THE ELIMINATION OF PRICE CONTROLS AND ADJUST-
MENT OF EXCHANGE RATE HAS PRACTICALLY ELIMINATED THE ONCE FLOURISH-
ING BLACK MARKETS IN COMMODITIES AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE. HOWEVER, THE
BURDEN OF AUSTERITY ON CHILEAN CONSUMERS HAS BEEN HEAVY. DESPITE
HEALTHY INCREASES IN WAGES AND RENEWED CONFIDENCE BY BUSINESSMEN,
WORKING CLASS CONSUMERS FIND IT DIFFICULT TO AFFORD THE BAREST
NECESSITIES, AND WORKING CLASS LABOR IS TAKING A WAIT AND SEE
ATTITUDE. THERE IS, HOWEVER, NO ORGANIZED RESISTANCE TO THE JUNTA
FOR ITS PROGRAMS. SOME POLITICAL FACTIONS, PARTICULARLY THE
CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY (PDC) ARE GRUMBLING, BUT THIS DISSATIS-
FACTION IS LARGELY DUE TO GOVERNMENT EFFORTS TO SET UP NEW NON-
POLITICAL-PARTY MECHANISMS FOR REACHING THE PUBLIC.
10. GOVERNMENT "RECESSING" OF CONGRESS AND ALL POLITICAL
PARTIES HAS CREATED A POLITICAL VACUUM IN CHILE. THE GOVERNMENT
WHICH HOLDS THE POLITICAL PARTIES LAURGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR CHILE'S
CURRENT PLIGHT, IS TRYING TO FILL THIS VOID BY AN INTENSE USE OF

12.
ALTHOUGH SOME CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS HOLD INFLUENTIAL GOVERN-
MENT POSITIONS, MOST CIVILIAN ADVISERS ARE EITHER CONSERVATIVE OR
APOLITICAL. LACK OF MORE WIDESPREAD PARTICIPATION BY CHRISTIAN
DEMOCRATS MAY CREATE PROBLEMS FOR THE GOVERNMENT IN THE FUTURE,
ESPECIALLY SINCE ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENTING WORKERS, CAMPESINOS
AND POBLADORES (WHICH FORMERLY SUPPORTED EITHER THE CHRISTIAN
DEMOCRATIC PARTY (PDC) OR THE ALLENDE GOVERNMENT) ARE SO FAR
THE GOVERNMENT HAS
INADEQUATELY REPRESENTED ON ADVISORY COUNCILS.
ESTABLISHED UNITS ADDRESSED TO YOUTH, WOMEN, GUILDS AND NEIGHBOR-
HOOD CIVIC GROUPS IN THE SECRETARIAT GENERAL OF GOVERNMENT, AND
HOPES THAT THESE WILL SERVE AS VEHICLES FOR GOVERNMENT-TO-PEOPLE
COMMUNICATION.
13. THE JUNTA LEADERS VIEW WITH DISTRUST ALL PDC EFFORTS TO
WIN NEW POLITICAL ADHERENTS FROM THE WORKING CLASSES WHICH FORMERLY
SUPPORTED ALLENDE'S UP COALITION AND REPORTEDLY BELIEVE THAT THE
PDC IS NOT RESPECTING THE POLITICAL RECESS.
THE JUNTA IS
PARTICULARLY CONCERNED BY THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE PDC'S LEFT WING

14. ONE PROBLEM OF MAJOR CONCERN TO THE JUNTA IS THE POSSIBILITY
THAT PERU MAY ATTACK CHILE SOME TIME PRIOR TO 1979, THE 100TH
ANNIVERSARY OF THE WAR BETWEEN CHILE AND PERU, IN ORDER TO REGAIN
SOME OF THE TERRITORY LOST IN THAT WAR.
THE CHILEANS ARE WORRIED BY
THE SOVIET SALE OF ARMS TO PERU AND FEAR THAT THE USSR MAY BE TRY-
ING TO CREATE ANOTHER UNSTABLE MIDDLE EAST TYPE" OF CLIMATE IN
LATIN AMERICA.
15. THE JUNTA IS ALSO CONCERNED BY COMMUNIST EFFORTS TO CREATE
INTERNAL DISCONTENT AND TO MOUNT AN INTERNAL RESISTANCE MOVEMENT.
THE JUNTA EXPECTS THAT THE FORMER UP PARTIES, LED BY THE COMMUNISTS,
WILL SET UP A UNIFIED FRONT FOR CAUSING CIVILIAN DISTURBANCES AND
POLITICAL DISCONTENT, AND WILL TRY TO MANIPULATE THE PEDC INTO
OPPOSING THE JUNTA GOVERNMENT. TWO FRONTS FOR CHILEAN RESISTANCE
ARE BEING ORGANIZED IN ARGENTINA AND SEVERAL ARE BEING SET UP IN
EUROPE.

1. FOLLOWING ANALYSIS OF CHILEAN ECONOMIC SITUATION AND OF RISK
FACTORS INVOLVED IN MAKING INVESTMENTS IN CHILE PREPARED FOR PASSAGE
TO HERMES BANK PER REF PARA 1 REQUEST.
A. THE RULING JUNTA IN CHILE IS MOVING AGGRESSIVELY TO
REBUILD THE ECONOMY BY ADOPTING A HARSH AUSTERITY PROGRAM AND IN-
STITUTING POLICIES DESIGNED TO RETURN CHILE TO A MARKET ECONOMY.
8. SANTIAGO MOVED QUICKLY AFTER THE COUP TO REMOVE PRICE.
CONTROLS ON ALL BUT 30 BASIC COMMODITIES, WHILE THE CENTRAL BANK
EFFECTIVELY DEVALUED THE ESCUDO BY SOME 60% IN AN EFFORT TO CURB
IMPORT DEMAND AND EASE PRESSURES ON SANTIAGO'S MEAGER FOREIGN EX-
CHANGE RESERVAES. AS A RESULT, CHILE'S COST OF LIVING JUMPED 88%
IN OCTOBER, BRINGING INFLATION TO NEARLY 450% FOR THE FIRST TEN MONTHS
OF THE YEAR. ANTICIPATED PRICE RISES DURING THE REST OF 1973 IS EX-
PECTED TO PUSH INFLATION TO SOME 750% FOR THE YEAR.

EXCHANGE RATES HAS PRACTICALLY ELIMINATED THE ONCE FLOURISHING BLACK
MARKETS IN COMMODITIES AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE.
WHILE EXCHANGE RATES
CHANGED AND PRICES ROSE, THE GROWTH IN THE MONEY SUPPLY HAS BEEN
SHARPLY CURTAILED, CAUSING A RELATIVE SCARCITY OF LOCAL CURRENCY AND
A LIQUIDITY CRUNCH FOR BUSINESSMEN.
D. THE BURDEN ON CONSUMERS HAS BEEN HEAVY.
DESPITE A
HEALTHY INCREASE IN THE MINIMUM WAGE, WORKING CLASS CONSUMERS ARE
FINDING IT INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO AFFORD THE BAREST NECESSITIES.
AUSTERITY HAS BEEN EXACERBATED IN MANY CASES BY DISMISSALS OF
* RELATIVELY UNPRODUCTIVE AND POLITICALLY SUSPECT EMPLOYEES HIRED
UNDER THE ALLENDE REGIME. AN UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION PROGRAM HAS
BEEN ANNOUNCED AND AN EXTENSIVE PUBLIC WORKS PROGRAM IS UNDER CON-
SIDERATION.
E. THE JUNTA IS ATTEMPTING TO ENLIST PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR
THE AUSTERITY PROGRAM AND BUSINESS IS SHOWING RENEWED CONFIDENCE.
CONSUMERS AND LABOR, HOWEVER, ARE TAKING A WAIT-AND-SEE ATTITUDE.
ORGANIZED RESISTANCE TO THE JUNTA OR ITS PROGRAMS HAS MATERIALIZED,

K. THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK FOR CHIBLE IS CAUTIOUSLY OPTI-
MISTIC AS THE JUNTA TAKES STEPS TO CORRECT. THE EXCESSES OF NEARLY
THREE YEARS OF DECAPITALIZATION UNDER STATE SOCIALISM.
THE PROGRAMS,
THOUGH AUSTERE, ARE ECONOMICALLY SOUND AND OFFER A FIRM FOUNDATION
FOR RECOVERY AND GROWTH OF THE CHILEAN ECONOMY. THE MAJOR POLICY
CONFLICTS WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT APPEAR TO BE OVER THE DEGREE AND
TIMING OF SPECIFIC MEASURES RATHER THAN PROBLEMS OF BASIC POLICY
ORIENTATION.
ECONOMIC
L. THE EMERGING DOMINANCE OF RAUL SAEZ AS SENIOR ECONOMIC
ADVISOR IS PROBABLY FOR THE BEST SINCE THE JUNTA'S AUSTERITY PROGRAM
MUST BE TEMPERED IF POLITICAL AS WELL AS ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND
STABILITY IS TO BE ACHIEVED. MEANWHILE, CHILE IS PREPARING TO
SETTLE OUTSTANDING COMPENSATION ISSUES AND COMPLETE BILATERAL NE-
GOTIATIONS ON 1971/72 DEBT SERVICE IN ACCORD WITH THE 1972 PARIS
CLUB AGREEMENTS. TIMELY RESOLUTION OF THESE ISSUES WILL GO FAR
IN IMPROVING INVESTOR AND CREDITOR CONFIDENCE IN CHILE.

QUICKLY, LONG RUN GROWTH WILL DEPEND HEAVILY ON CHILE'S ABILITY TO
ATTRACT ADEQUATE FOREIGN INVESTMENT: ATTRACTION OF SUBSTANTIAL NEW
INVESTMENT WILL DEPEND ON THE JUNTA'S ABILITY TO DEMONSTRATE GOOD
FAITH IN THE TREATMENT OF FOREIGN EQUITY AS THEIR ABILITY TO INSTILL
WELL AS
CONFIDENCE IN CHILE'S PROSPECTS FOR STABLE RECOVERY AND GROWTH. A
CRITICAL FIRST STEP IS TIMELY SETTLEMENT OF OUTSTANDING COMPENSBATION
CLAIMS EMANATING FROM THE ALLENDE NATIONALIZATIONS. THE JUNTA HAS
STATED THAT IT WILL EITHER RETURN INTERVENED FIRMS TO THE PRIVATE
SECTOR OR, AS IN THE CASE OF THE LARGE COPPER MINES, ADEQUATELY
COMPENSATE THE PREVIOUS OWNERS. SOME 90 FIRMS ARE ALREADY IN THE
PROCESS OF REVERSION.
J.
THUS FAR THE JUNTA HAS SUCCEEDED IN LINING UP SUF-
FICIENT FOREIGN CREDITS TO ENABLE IT TO PURCHASE ESSENTIAL CAPITAL
GOODS AND FINANCE THE CURRENT PAYMENTS GAP. IN ADDITION, THERE ARE
STRONG INDICATIONS OF RENEWED INVESTOR CONFICENCE, AND PRIVATE FOR-
D
EIGN INVESTMENT IN CHILE IS EXPECTED TO GROW DRAMATICALLY DURING THE

CHILE STILL FACES LARGE BALANCE-OF-PAYMENTS DEFICITS
IN BOTH 1973 AND 1974 EVEN IF DEBT-REPAYMENTS ARE RESCHEDULED IN BOTH
YEARS. WITH A MASSIVE #4 BILLION FOREIGN DEBT HANGING OVER SANTIAGO'S
HEAD, IT WILL AT LEAST BE SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE CHILE'S BALANCE-OF-
PAYMENTS POSITION IMPROVES SIGNIFICANTLY.
G.
HOWEVER, COPPER PRODUCTION HAS ALREADY INCREASED MORE
THAN 50% ABOVE LAST YEAR'S LEVEL AS A RESULT OF A 9% LENGTHENING OF
THE WORK WEEK AND IMPROVED MINE MANAGEMENT. PRODUCTION WILL PROBABLY
REACH A RECORD 750.000 TONS NEXT YEAR DESPITE CONTINUING SHORTAGES OF
SPARE PARTS AND SERVICEABLE VEHICLES.
H. AGRICULTURAL IMPORTS CONTINUE TO BE THE LARGEST DRAIN
ON FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND THE RECOVERY OF DOMESTIC PRODUCTION IS A
PRIORITY OBJECTIVE OF THE JUNTA. FARM OUTPUT, HOWEVER, IS NOT EX-
PECTED TO FULLY RECOVER UNTIL THE 1974/75.HARVEST SINCE MOST CROPS
ALREADY ARE PLANTED AND ARE WELL INTO THEIR GROWING SEASONS. THUS,
CHILE WILL CONTINUE TO IMPORT GRAIN IN LARGE QUANTITIES DURING 1974.

DEGAN PREPARING INSTRUCTIONS FOR PARTY MEMBERS TO AID IN SUPPORT:
THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHILE (PCCH).. INITIAL
INSTRUCTIONS TO PCP/SOVIET MEMBERS WERE TO ARRANGE FOR LODGING FOR
MEMBERS OF OTHER LATIN AMERICAN COMMUNIST PARTIES WHO WERE ARRIVING
IN LINA, TO OBTAIN MAPS OF CHILE, FALSE DOCUMENTATION, ETC.
b. SECOND STAGE OF SUPPORT TO CHILE WAS TO BEGIN DURING WEEK
OF 23 SEPTEMBER WHEN COMMUNISTS AND OTHERS WERE TO ARRIVE FROM

ENFRENTAMIENTO CHILENO, LOS ATAQUES LANZADOS POR LA UNIDAD POPULAR
CONTRA SUS ENEMIGOS EN LA POLITICA Y EN LOS MEDIOS DE DIFUSION RARAS :
VECES SE LLEVARON A CABO FRONTAL O ABIERTAMENTE.
CASI SIEMPRE FUERON
Y EN LO TOCANTE A LOS MEDIOS INFORMATIVOS,
DE CARACTER ECONOMICO.
CASI NUNCA SE LLEGO, POR EJEMPLO, AL EXTREMO DE LA CENSURA DIRECTA. Y
LA PRENSA OPOSICIONISTA PUDO ESCRIBIR Y DECIR LO QUE LE PARECIO
DURANTE LOS CASI TRES ANOS QUE EL ALLENDISMO SE MANTUVO EN EL PODER.
LA DUDA SIEMPRE FUE SI DICHOS MEDIOS LOGRARIAN & NO SOBREVIVIR
ECONOMICAMENTE Y SEGUIR MANIFESTANDO SU CRITERIS. V
SOLO TRES MESES DESPUES DE HABER ASUMIDO ALLENDE LA PRESIDENCIA,
LA PRENSA ESCRITA OBTUVO UN PRESAGIO DE LO QUE PODRIA SUCEDERLE AL
MONOPOLIZAR EL GOBIERNO LA IMPRESION DE REVISTAS Y LIBROS EN EL PAIS.
ESTO SE CONSUMO MEDIANTE LA ADQUISICION DE UNA FIRMA EDITORNIAL QUE
HABIA SIDO DEBILITADA PREVIAMENTE POR UNA PROLONGADA HUELGA DIRIGIDA
POR LOS COMUNISTAS, Y POR UN ARBITRAJE EN EL QUE ACTUO COMO MEDIADOR
OTRO COMUNISTA, CUYO FALLO COLOCO A LA EMPRESA AL EBORDE DE LA
QUIEBRA. 4

Y A SALVAR A CHILE DEL ANIQUILAMIENTO POLITICC, SOCIAL, Y ECONOMICO.
SE ABREN AHORA PERSPECTIVAS DE RECUPERACION MEDIANTE UN
INTENSO Y DISCIPLINADO ESFUERZO QUE RESTABLEZCA EL HABITO DEL
TRABAJO. NORMALICE LAS FAENAS. DETENGA LA DESTRUCCION DEL PATRIMONIO
NACIONALLY REINICIE EL PROCESO DE CAPITALIZACION INDISPENSABLE
AL FUTURO BIENESTAR.
CON INNEGABLE SACRIFICIO Y ABNEGATION, LAS FUERZAS:
ARMADAS HAS CUMPLIDO SU PAPEL DE SALVAGUARDIA ULTIMA DE LA
INSTITUCIONALIDAD. PERO LA DURA TAREA QUE IMPONE RESTANAR LAS
HERIDAS Y REANUDAR LA MARCHA DE LA NACION EXIGE EL APOYO RESUELTO
DE AQUELLA MAYORIZ CUIDADANA QUE, EN TODOS LOS TONOS, HA PEDIDO
UNA HONDA RECTIFICACION.
EL QUEBRANTAMIENTO CONSTITUCIONAL PROVOCADO POR EL MARXISMO
NO PUDO SOLDARSE CON LAS SOLAS INICIATIVAS DE LOS PARTIDOS
POLITICOS. LAS FUERZAS ARMADAS Y CARABINEROS NO DESEABAN NI
HAD DESEADO NUNCA TOMAR SOBRE SI LA RESPONSIBILIDAD DE CONDUCIR
LOS DESTINOS DE LA NACION, PERO EL DRAMATICO FRACASO DE LA UNIDAD
POPULAR Y LAS LIMITACIONES DEL CUADRO POLITICO OPOSITOR PARA
CONSEGUIR EL INDISPENSABLE CAMBIO DE RUMBO FORZARON LA SITUACION
HASTA EL PUNTO EN QUE SE ENCUENTRA.

LAS RESERVAS QUE ESTA POSICION DE LA JUNTA PUEDAN INSPIRAR
A CIER OS SECTORES POLITICOS NO PUEDEN SER TAN ABSOLUTAS QUE
LLEGUEN HASTA NEGAR EL CONCURSO DE TODOS LOS CHILENOS AL ESFUERZO
DE RECONSTRUCCION DE SU PATRIA. POR EL CONTRARIO, A TRAVES

GRAN PARTE DE LA GESTION PRESIDENCIAL DE ALLENDE CASI TODA LA TELE-
VISION DE CHILE ESTABA CONTROLADA POR LOS MARXISTAS O POR SUS
SIMPATIZANTES. ESTA SITUACION CAMBIO SOLO CUANDO LA UNIVERSIDAD
CATOLICA DE SANTIAGO LE ARRANSCO EL DOMINIO DE SU CANAL DE TV A LOS.
ALLENDISTAS Y SE UNIO A LA UNIVERSIDAD CATOLICA DE VALPARAISO EN
UN ESFUERZO POR LLEVARLE UNA PROGRAMACION NO-MARXISTA A TODA LA
CIUDADANIA, UTILIZANDO ESTACIONES DE RELEVO DE MICROONDA DE
ELABORACION CASERA. TRUNFARON EN ESTE EMPENO EN UNA MEDIDA ASOMBROSA
MIENTRAS SALVAGAN LOS OBSTACULOS DE TODO TIPO, AUN FISICOS, QUE EL
REGIMEN LES INTERPONIA PARA IMPEDIRSELO. 4
EL MERCURIO, EL PERIODICO MAS GRANDE DEL PAIS, HABIA PERDIDO EL
SESENTA PORCIENTO DE SU VOLUMEN PUBLICITARIO NORMAL A MEDIADOS DE
1971, Y CUALQUIER ESTACION RADIAL CORRIENTE, NO AFILIADA A LA UNIDAD
POPULAR, PROMEDIABA UN OCHENTA PEORCIENTO DE PERDIDAS SEMEJANTES. Y
ESTA EROSION PUBLICITARIA CONTINUO HACIENDO ESTRAGOS A MEDIDA QUE
LAS PEQUENAS EMPRESAS INDEPENDIENTES FUERON SUSPENDIENDO. SUS
ANUNCIOS AL IRSE AGOTANDO SUS EXISTENCIAS DE MERCANCIAS O AL
SOBREPASAR POR MUCHO LA DEMANDA A LOS ABSTECIMIENTOS DISPONSIBLES.

ESE ANO EL CONGRESO APROBO UN IMPUESTO ESPECIAL PARA AYUDAR A COSTEAR
TODAS LAS EMISORAS, VETANDO AMBAS INICIATIVAS EL PRESIDENTE DE LA
REPUBLICA. Y
EN SEPTIEMBRE, DESPUES DEL SEGUNDO DE ERSTOS VETOS, PARECIA QUE
LAS CUATRO ESTACIONES MAS IMPORTANTES DE ESTA CAPITAL NO ADSCRITAS A

TRATANDO DE RESCATAR A BALLENDE, CUYO PROPIO PARTIDO SOCIALISTA,.
DE FILIACION MARXISTA, REPRESENTABA EL MAS NUTRICO DE LOS ELEMENTOS
IRRACIONALES QUE CONFORMABAN LA UNIDAD POPULAR, LOS COMUNISTAS

BY DENYING THAT THERE HAS EVER BEEN ANY "UNCONFESSABLE"
INCOME IN ITS HISTORY, EL MERCURIO'S BOOKS WERE SUBJECT TO MOST
THOROUGH, AND HOSTILE SCRUTINY DURING THE MARXIST REGIME WITHOUT
ANYONE BEING ABLE TO SPECIFY IRREGULARITEIES. THEREFORE, EL
MERCURIO REJECTS "WITH LEGITIMATE DISDAIN THE IRRESPONSIBLE
CHARGES MADE BY A CLOSE COLLABORATOR OF MR. KENNEDY AND
FEELS AUTHORIZED TO CONJECTURE THAT THE ATTACK IS THE FRUIT
OF JOURNALISTIC IRRESPONSIBILITY OR OF THE ANIMOSITY OF THE
ADVISORS OF A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WHO IS STOPPED SINCE
SEVERAL YEARS AGO IN HIS AMBITIONS BY THE MORAL EXAMINATION
EGRLY
OF HIS ACTIONS TO WHICH HE HAS BEEN SUBJECTED IN HIS COUNTRY".
4. PRESIDENT FORD'S STATEMENTS ON CHILE FROM HIS 16 SEPTEMBER
NEWS CONFERENCE WERE CARRIED. IN FULL BY "EL MERCURIO" UNDER FRONT
PAGE HEADLING "FORD: U.S. HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH FALL OF ALLENDE,"
THERE WAS NO EDITORIAL COMMENT IN "EL MERCURIO" AND NO NEWS OR

OPINION THAT THE JUNTA WILL NEITHER RAISE THE MATTER WITH

Since President Allende's electoral victory in 1970, the Government
propaganda apparatus has mounted a coordinated campaign against
the opposition communications media focusing on the prestigious
El Mercurio newspaper chain and key opposition radios.
range goal is to create conditions that will insure Government
The long-
control over the media so that an emasculated opposition will operate
intuitively and through self-censorship within an approved framework.
The opposition radio stations bear the brunt of an array of legal
and illegal devices designed to intimidate them. These devices
include the threat of violence, favoritism in the distribution of
essential Government advertising revenue, temporary closures,

has
Chile's national television the only country-wide channel
become an important propaganda instrument for the Government.
But it is being challenged by a Catholic University channel which is
attempting to expand its service beyond the Santiago area.
A major confrontation between the Government and the opposition,
lasting more than a year, has taken place at the Papelera, Chile's
only important private newsprint producer, with the company
supported by the opposition media stymying repeated Government
efforts to take over the firm. The paper company claims that
Government price policies have brought it close to bankruptcy.
Despite officially-sanctioned harassment, the opposition media
have continued to function, taking advantage of the fluid political
situation currently prevailing in Chile, and have become increasingly
effective in exploiting the Government's economic failures and the
growing dissension within the ruling Marxist coalition,
Nevertheless, the opposition's economic base that sustains its media
is being slowly undermined as the Government expands its control
over the Chilean economy. Many opposition media are reportedly
already in difficult financial straits. The Chilean Communist Party,
seeking to strengthen its voice in the March 1973 Congressional
elections, has already purchased five beleaguered radio stations
(one a former opposition station) in southern Chile.

III. THE ALLENDE PROCESS
->
HOW THE MEDIA ARE TREATED
Allende's treatment of the opposition media and his utilization of
the pro-Government media offer revealing insights into the unique
claim that Chile will carry out a Socialist revolution within the frame-
work of traditional bourgeois and democratic institutions without
social cost.
Any Chilean government possesses wide powers that can be employed
to control and intimidate media opponents given sufficient will power and
cynicism to do so, despite the fact that media freedoms in Chile are
twice-guaranteed, both in the 1925 constitution and in a statute of
constitutional guarantees agreed to by Allende's Popular Unity coalition
and the Christian Democrats (PDC) as a condition for PDC support for
Allende in the congressional run-off held cubsequent to the Presidential
election in September 1970.
What are some of these powers? Any Chilean executive under
provisions of the State Internal Security Law may establish emergency
zones by decree headed by military commanders empowering the State
to enforce news censorship and to restrict access to newsprint supplies.
A law on publicity abuses empowers the government to petition the
courts to suspend access to news and information. (Laws on the books
that pose potential threats to freedom of radio information are more
severe and more frequently utilized. See Section III. B. Radio,).
Furthermore, through the judicious parceling out of advertising from:
State and autonomous State firms any government can discriminate
against opposition media by denying or restricting this key source of
revenue.
Unlike predecessor governments which utilized existing laws and
accepted practices to reward political associates and benefit business
partners, the Allende Government has consistently and frequently
applied these measures to harass, to intimnidate, and to undermine the
morale of political and class opponents in the media. These tactics
are applied throughout the country.

A favorite target of the Government and it's propaganda apparatus
has been the conservative, independent daily El Mercurio, dean of the
Chilean press and chief representative of the largest and most influential
newspaper chain in the country. Tarred regularly as "pro-U.S." and
as a "gringo newspaper written in Spanish" potent accusations in
Chile El Mercurio has borne the brunt ofjevery conceivable kind of
pressure short of outright seizure.

On numerous occasions the paper has been implicated along with
other opposition media in alleged seditious plots carried out in concert
with foreign (i. e., U.S.) interests to overthrow the Government.
Advertisers have been "requested" not to do business with the Mercurio
chain, which has been accused of foreign exchange irregularities by
tax authorities, by Government supporters on the paper's own staff, and
by Allende himself at public rallies. Allende, too, periodically reacts
to critical Mercurio editorials with charges that Chile and the
Presidential office have been "insulted," that the Mercurio chain
indulges in "libertinism unprecedented in Chilean journalistic history.

Partial blame for leftist infiltration of Chilean stations must rest
with "bourgeois" radio owners. Long before Allende became president
the Chilean businessmen and politicians who owned radio stations
made it a practice to hire leftist commentators because they believed
that leftists were superior professionals and helped to increase
listenership. When the UP came to power it tapped an existing source
of manpower.
In addition, the Government frequently utilized existing regulations
to gain its ends. Radio concessions are granted by a Government
entity (Servicios Electricos) attached to the Interior Ministry. The
same entity can cancel or transfer such concessions. Regulations
promulgated during World War II state that "In case of internal
disturbance, catastrophe or war radio stations are subject to the
rules, control, and censorship that the Government may adopt.
Under this type of emergency regulation, all radio stations were
placed under an obligatory Government network -- not an unusual
practice for the Allende Government -- when a modified martial
law was decreed in 21 of Chile's 25 provinces during the October-

A basic organizational technique for the UP coalition has been the
Comité de Unidad Popular)
establishment of UP committees (CUP
composed of newsmen who are militant members of parties belonging
to the Government coalition or independent supporters of UP policies
in newspapers, radios, magazines, and in journalistic bodies. The
CUP's have been most active at the union level: demanding exorbitant
wage increases, insisting that UP employees be given the right to
express their opinion on editorial pages, disrupting legitimate union
meetings, forming rump unions, and leaking internal company data to
the leftist press and to the Government.
.
-->>
The goal of certain Unidad Popular militants regarding freedom of
the press was most explicitly and revealingly stated by the organizing
committee for a conference of leftist journalists which was held in
Santiago in April 1971. The committee issued the following statement
prior to the conference:
'
... we believe that we must fight for true freedom of
the press, which will only be possible when there is
true economic independence. We maintain that Chile
will have true freedom of the press only when the means
of mass communication are part of the area of social
property, that is, (when they) belong to all Chileans..
The press, radio, television, and the theater must be
tools at the service of liberation and culture of our
people and not a private business, an ideological
battering ram of the national and foreign minority
(under-
(the capitalists) as is presently the case.
lining added)
{

Another statement said "the mission of journalists is to support and
defend the People's Government (the UP) together with all the workers."
The declaration also underlined the support of UP newsmen for
"Viet-Nam, Cuba, and all the people that are building Socialism,"
and threw a bouquet at Cuba's Prensa Latina agency for its "objective"
reporting of the Chilean phenomenon. Allende himself lent legitimacy
to the mission of UP journalists in a speech kicking off the conference
when he stated that "committed" newsmen must act as the "vanguard"
of the revolution by "elevating the political level of the people.
Reiterating a theme expressed on many other occasions, Allende
asserted that his Government would respect freedom of information
while at the same time he lamented his Government's "excessive
tolerance" for the opposition media.

and that the chain is "faithful to its tradition of infamy. The
Government propaganda apparatus follows suit.
The PDC organ La Prensa and the National Party tabloid
La Tribuna are secondary targets for the UP propaganda apparatus
because their circulation is limited. Pressures employed against
these dailies are aimed generally at the political parties behind them
in contrast to the Mercurio chain where pressures are intended as a
warning signal to the "free" media as an institution.
The
Independent La Tercera receives, distinct treatment.
Government exerts minimal pressures on the paper in return for
favorable editorial treatment of Allende policies (see Section VI.
A. The Opposition Media Reaction). This tactic has paid dividenda
for Allende and for Tercera's owner, Germán Pico Canas. Allende
obtains favorable publicity in a mans-circulation paper that maintains
comparative objectivity in its news columns, thus lending credence to
Allende's claims that he will respect traditional Chilean freedoms
while making the transition to Socialism. Freed from the need for
the strident partisanship so characteristic of the rest of the press,
Tercera steadily builds its circulation with a public seeking some
relief from the verbal civil war. As a result Pico, who has been head
of the Chilean newspaper association, has defended the Allende
Government's press policies in international forums. The under-
standing with the Government, however, is an uneasy one; Tercera
is not sufficiently malleable for the Socialist Party, the principal party
in the Government coalition.

Radio
i
•
Radio continues to be the most important medium of communication
in Chile. The latest available figures compiled by the World Radio-TV
Handbook give Chile a total of 137 stations, including 29 in the capital
city. Santiago (See Table 3). The number of receivers is estimated at
3 million, or one for every third person. In a country 2,600 miles long
radio's strategic importance is understood by both Government and
opposition. The Government has resorted to a variety of devices
designed to intimidate opposition radio stations; requests by Allende
advisers that opposition stations hire designated leftist commentators;
threats of violence; favoritism in the distribution of needed government
advertising revenues; temporary closures; and strikes fomented by
CUP committees.

November 1972 truck drivers strike (See Note No. 18). Another
regulation decrees that stations must interrupt their transmissions
whenever the Interior Minister judges it to be necessary in the
interest of the internal security of the State. Still another regulation
authorizes the Central Bank to control the importation of equipment
and spare parts for radio, television, and the press,
The Government moved quickly after the 1970 presidential
election to obtain control of key stations, The Socialist Party
gained control of Radio Portales, Chile's most popular station,
and purchased Radio Corporación from El Mercurio (Portales has
subsequently slipped in popularity). The Communist Party purchased
Magallenes, an important Santiago station, The Communist Party
recently also purchased Radio Simón Bolívar (formerly pro-
opposition) in Concepción (as well as four other stations in southern
Chile in preparation for the Congressional elections in March 1973).
The rightist National Party daily La Tribuna quoted the former
owner as saying that "the age of privately-owned mass media
(in Chile) is over" with only the Government, strong economic
consortiums, and the most powerful political parties capable of
sustaining media operations. La Tribuna says the Communist Party
is now the most powerful (single) broadcaster in southern Chile.

PDC-oriented Radios Balmaceda and Cooperativa, however, have
to date successfully resisted Government enticements and pressures
(see Section VI. A. The Opposition Media Reaction). Balmaceda
radio station which over the years had earned a reputation for objec-
tive newscasts has been the number one target of the UP in the
radio field. It has suffered more temporary closures than any radio
facility. The station was shut down, for example, 17 hours in
June 1971 for broadcasting an alleged "alarmist" report during the
State of Emergency decreed after the assassination of Perez Zujovic,
a former interior minister in the Frei Government. At the same
time a UP station, Portales, received nothing more than an admoni-
tion for transmitting "alarmist" news more acceptable to UP
propagandists. During the August-September 1971 period Radio
Balmaceda was shut down on three separate occasions under
similar pretexts (see Note No. 10).

In radio as in the press the Government has used CUP
committees to formulate exaggerated wage demanda, to foment
strikes, and to form ramp unions. CUP unions at Radio Pacifico, ·
for example, forced the owner to sell out to a cooperative formed.
by employees when wage demands could not be met, The radio
station subsequently was purchased by the Radical Party
member of the UP coalition,

The principal Governinent weapon, however, is its control
over public service advertising, which traditionally has provided
the bulk of revenues for Chilean radio stations. The Government
has dangled the prospect of advertisements in return for favorable
news treatment, but the bait has not been picked up by the major
opposition radios which recognize that their independence is at
stake. The economic squeeze makes the future of Chilean
independent radios appear bleak.

C. Television
Since its inception in Chile in 1962, television has made great
atrides, but the medium still lags behind radio, especially in the
provinces where technical conditions for viewing are poor. Accord-
ing to the best estimates available, there are 350, 000 sets in
Santiago and a total of 500, 000 sets in the country. Chile is served
by the following television channels: 1) A national network with
some 21 outlets throughout the country; 2) the Catholic, University
channel in Santiago; 3) a separate Catholic University channel in
Valparaíso; and 4) the University of Chilg channel in Santiago,
-->>
The Government clearly recognizes television's importance as
a propaganda vehicle, and under the direction of an Allende
confidante, newsman Augusto Olivares (Socialist and a suspected.
member of the ultra-left MIR Movement of the Revolutionary
Left), it has transformed Chile's only nationwide television channel
into an outright political instrument of the Government coalition.
Slanted commentaries favoring UP policies, character assassinations
intended to smear political and class opponents, and a steady drum-
fire of Socialist propaganda in news and cultural programming
became standard fare,

Quimantu quickly began turning out magazines, comic books,
and textbooks pushing UP policies. Comic books like Firme
were designed for mass consumption and aimed at adults with
low cultural levels, while others like Ramona were aimed at the
teen-age market. Cabrochico, another/comic book, was geared to
pre-teens. The format of some Quimantu products closely resembled
competing Zig-Zag products. The weekly Ahora, for example, was.
designed to compete with Ercilla. After eight months Ahora collapsed,
rejected in the market place by Chileans who were turned off by heavy-
handed political propaganda.
E. Films
The Government's film production company, Chile Films, became
the UP's principal propaganda arm in the film field. Rival Chilean
private producers went out of business, squeezed by rising production
costs and discriminatory tax and exchange rate treatment that denied
them needed equipment and spare parts from abroad. Chile Films
signed a comprehensive exchange accord in March 1971 with the Cuban
Cinematographic Institute (ICAIC) (See Section V. C. Exchange of
Persons, Visitors, and Exchange Agreements).
Chile Films also initiated agreements with the experimental film
institute (leftist) at the University of Chile, the film institute at the
Communist-dominated State Technical University (UTE), the Govern-
ment information office, the film department of the Communist-
dominated CUT (Central Unica de Trajabadores -- the major labor
organization), the national television network, and the University of
Chile television station. The stated purpose of the accords was to
"develop the new Chilean film industry.
"
Its products are intended to glorify the roles of workers, peasants,
and students in the march to Chilean-style Socialism, romanticize the
proletarian role of the Chilean Communist and Socialist Parties, and
attack the "bourgeoisie" and their "imperialist" allies. Despite an
intense publicity buildup, however, few films actually appeared in
the 1970-72 period. Most of the films that were produced appeared to
be pieced together from newsreel film taken during the Allende
presidential campaign or from post-election political rallies.

At the same time network authorities made it difficult under a
variety of pretexts for opposition spokesmen to air their views in
contravention of the State television statute, For example, the
authorities frequently obliged all television channels and radios to
carry official statements and denied opposition spokesmen equal
time, resorting to the legal fiction that the official statements were
transmitted voluntarily.
A popular political chat show "A Tres Bandas," in which opposi-
tion representatives freely debated UP representatives (the only such
show carried nationally), was cancelled in August 1972 after two
years of UP agitation against it. The Government defended the step

University Confrontation and Television Freedoms
Growing opposition confidence fed by an election victory at the
University of Chile in April 1972 and by stiffening opposition
attitudes at Santiago's Catholic University had important spill-over
effects in television programming at two channels run by Catholic
University. Increasing opposition effectiveness even raised the
possibility that the Marxist-controlled University of Chile channel-for
the first time in its existence might be obliged to inject some
objectivity into its output.

The Government's delay in making public the results of June 1972
elections for top posts in the Communist-dominated CUT tabor
federation also damaged Government credibility. The opposition
media scored heavily in a barrage of charges of irregularities and
vote fraud with a public that takes justified price in clean elections.
B. The Papelera Confrontation
-
The Compañía Manufacturera de Papeles Y Cartones (known as
the Papelera), Chile's major private producer of newsprint, became
another propaganda battleground cast by the opposition in terms of
"freedom versus Marxist totalitarianism.".
In October 1971, the Government, carrying out a long-standing
pledge, announced that CORFO (the Government Development
Corporation) had opened negotiations to buy out the Papelera through
the purchase of its stock, The opposition media trainediately launched
a campaign to warn the public that the free press would be crippled
if newsprint distribution were placed at the mercy of Government
suppliers. At the same time, the opposition media pleaded with
private shareholders to refuse to sell to the Government. In addition,
a "freedom fund" was created enabling private persons to buy up
Papelera shares to prevent the company from falling into Government
hands.
For several months pro- and anti-Government media carried out
daily an intensive propaganda battle in advertisements, news stories,.
and editorials. Both sides resorted to the familiar numbers game:
the pro-Allende media claimed that the Government was besieged by
willing shareholders eager to sell out; the opposition asserted that
shareholders were resisting temptation. Government propagandists
argued that newsprint production was essential to the State and must
be controlled by the State; the opposition said Papelera must remain
in private hands as a patriotic duty.
Thwarted to date in its attempt to buy out Papelera shareholders,
the Government has not hesitated to use other measures --
controls, labor-induced production shortages, and strong-arm tactics

press also circulated rumors that Jorge Alessandri (former President

Incumbent University of Chile Rector Edgardo Boeninger, an
independent with Christian Democratic sympathies, gained 51.9 per cent
of the vote for rector in April against three other contenders repre-
senting the UP coalition and leftist splinter groups, including the
MIR. An independent-PDC state alto gained control of the previously
Marxist-controlled Superior Nomative Council. The victory was
billed by the opposition media as another victory for democracy and
pluralism over Marxist totalitarianism. 14 In the process Rector
Boeninger became a hero of the opposition media and a symbol of
"democratic" defiance of Government efforts to impose its will on
an independent university. The opposition's rallying cry became
"Defend a democratic and pluralist university." Translated into
media terms it became "We want a democratic and pluralistic
university TV channel,"
Rallying behind that slogan, opposition supporters at the two
Catholic Universities (Santiago and Valparaíso) began to ease out
leftist influence in the news departments of the two university
channels. UP supporters, however, remain at the technician level
at the Santiago channel and can be expected to create problems for
their opponents. Opposition authorities who now control the channel
are proceeding cautiously against them,

A more significant indication of UP long-range attitudes toward
television freedoms has been the Government's persistent refusal to
permit university television stations to extend their networks
throughout Chile. In September 1972, President Allende blocked the
opposition's most recent attempt to obtain legislative sanction for
such an extension by vetoing selected items in a PDC-introduced bill;
The Government claimed that its own bill -- pending before Congress
and allowing universities to establish stations only within the
territory in which the seat of each university is located
create a national network for all recognized universities on an
"equal and non-discriminatory" basis. What the Government did
not say was that the bill if passed would preserve the State Network's
position as the only single channel that can be viewed by a national
television audience. Presumably the Government bill also would
permit the Communist-dominated State Technical University to
operate a television station in Santiago in competition with Santiago's
Catholic University channel which, according to available public
opinion surveys, is viewed by approximately 69 per cent of the
capital's audience. 15

since the bloody overthrow of Salvador
Allende last September, but the questions
that were raised at that time still need answering.
Where should the primary responsibility. be placed
for the tragic events on and after September 11,
1973? Was it, as the Left contends, the result of a
fascist counterrevolution aided and abetted by the
forces of imperialism? Was it, as the Right asserts,
the only available response to Allende's attempt to
establish the dictatorship of the proletariat by a
mixture of guile and force? Did it mark the "death
of a dream" of the establishment of socialism by
democratic means, and was it thereby one more
demonstration that Marxism must use force to ac-
complish its goals? Were there internal and external
political and economic factors which made it im-
possible for Allende's experiment to succeed, or
was the downfall of the Unidad Popular (Popular
Unity) coalition government the consequence of a
series of ideologically-influenced analyses and mis.
taken policy choices which, if they had been differ-
ent, might have produced another result? A review
of the course of the Allende government with the
ald of the considerable new material that has be
come available in recent months may help to answer
these questions.
Allende's opponents never tire of pointing out
that he was elected with only 36 percent of the vote

over.
Political and Economic Strategy
When he took office, Allende promised that he
would follow a "second model" of Marxism-the
via Chilena to socialism, "with meat pies and red
wine." To prove that this model was "anticipated
by the classics of Marxism," he quoted from
Friedrich Engels on the possibility of

• Allende's supporters in the Popular Unity coalition consisted of
his own Socialist Party (Partido Socialista-PS), the Communist
Party (Partido Comunista-PC), the main body of the Radical Party
(Partido Radical-PR), the leftist Catholic "Movement of Popular
United Action" (Movimiento de Acción Popular Unida—MAPU), and
two other smaller groups. The largest opposition groups wore the
centrist Christian Democratic Party (Partido Democrata Cristiano-
PDC) and the'rightist National Party (Partido Nacional—PN)..
in retrospect, it is ironic that the Chilean Senate never acted on
constitutional amendment proposed early in 1970 to establish a
second-round popular election, which would have provided the
President thus elected (probably the right-wing candidate, Jorge
Alessandri) with a clear popular mandale.

.
Yet it was precisely the question of majority sup.
port that was Allende's central problem in his de-
sign to carry out a peaceful transition to "socialism
with democracy, pluralism and liberty." The parties
In his coalition were in a distinct minority in the
Congress, and although there was no doubt about the
legitimacy of his election by that body, his victory
had only been possible because of the conditional
support of the Christian Democrats. The PDC, it'
should be noted, included both Radomiro Tornic,
the party's, 1970 presidential candidate, who had
gone to Allende's house to congratulate him the
day after the popular election, clearly inferring his
future support, and conservatives like Senator Juan
de Dios Carmona, who had fought within the party
to prevent it from voting for Allende in the run-off.
In the immediate aftermath of the election the PDC
was controlled by the Tornic forces, who claimed
to be in favor of "communitarian" socialism, nation-
alization of copper, acceleration of agrarian reform,
and reduction of Chile's dependencia on the United
States. One way, then, for Allende to achieve his
acknowledged goal of majority support for the
transition to socialism would have been to try to
arrive at an understanding with the Christian Demo-
crats on the points in his program with which they
were In agreement. This might have provoked the
secession of some of the rightist members of the
PDC, but if an accord had been reached with the
party's leaders, it would likely have given Allende
a majority in the Congress for at least part of his
program.
Flushed with victory and unwilling to come to
terms with the party which he had termed "the new
face of reaction" during the campaign, Allende chose
an alternative strategy. The next congressional elec-
tions were not scheduled to take place until March
1973, but the Chilean Constitution provided that in
the event of a conflict with the Congress over the
text of a constitutional amendment, the President
could call a national plebiscite. The strategic course.
adopted by Allende was to attempt to expand popu-
lar support for his coalition and then propose a
constitutional amendment which, in accordance with
the Popular Unity electoral program, would replace
the existing bicameral legislature with a unicameral

house, to be elected immediately following the ap.
proval of the amendment. The Congress would be
certain to reject the amendment, but if Allende
had the support of a majority in the country, he
could win the plebiscite and secure control of the
unicameral legislature that would then be estab-
lished.
Allende's strategy for the expansion of electoral
support was an economic one which drew as much
from John Maynard Keynes as it did from Karl Marx,
The Chilean economy, already operating below
capacity, had gone into a profound recession as a
result of Allende's election. The response of Pedro
Vuskovic, Allende's Minister of Economics, was to
"prime the pump" by adopting a deficit budget, in-
creasing public expenditures, and redistributing in-
come by skewing the annual wage readjustment for
the preceding year's inflation (35 percent in 1970)
in favor of the low-income sector of the population
(the lowest income groups received a 40-percent in-
crease). The utilization of unused industrial ca-
pacity, combined with strict enforcement of price
controls, more stringent collection of taxes, and re-
fusal to devalue the Chilean escudo in relation to
the dollar, were expected to contain possible infla-
tionary pressures which might result. (The Allende
government also had a cushion of nearly $400
million in foreign reserves left to it by the Frei
government as a result of high international prices
for copper, Chile's principal export.)
The strategy also contained a Marxist element-

accentuation of the class struggle. At the same time
that appeals were made to the pocketbooks of the
lower-class Chileans, there was also to be an effort
to increase their class consciousness (concienti
zación) through government publications and the
use of the media to remove the elements of "false
consciousness" instilled by "bourgeois" propaganda.
Expressing the diametric opposite of a claim often
voiced by his predecessor, Eduardo Frei, Allende
caid in a press conference just after his installation,
"I am not president of all Chilcans." And in his first
"State of the Nation" message to the Congress he
asserted:
The takeover of large sectors of Chile's basic
industry and trade, as promised in the Popular Unity
economic and political strategy aimed at achieving
program, was thus seen as an essential part of an
acceleration of agrarian reform (again using existing
and maintaining power. Combined with a rapid
legislation-the 1967 agrarian reform law-but ex-
ploiting provisions such as one authorizing the
expropriation of "abandoned or badly-farmed land,"
with one percent payment in cash and the rest in
expropriation of "abandoned or badly-farmed land."

the effort to create a unicameral left-dominated
legislature failed, the Allende government could

sition through a series of "irreversible" faits accom-

sectors with antagonistic and opposing interests.'
Allende's economic advisers anticipated an addi
tional source of revenue for the government from
the "exploitative" profits of the industries that were
to be nationalized by the new government. The par-
tially American-owned copper mines were to be
taken over by a constitutional amendment-both to
lay to rest any legal doubts about the reversal of
the Frei Chileanization agreements of 1967 and
1969, and because a general consensus in Chile
favored nationalization. Other companies were to
be nationalized after a controlling interest was gained
through the purchase of shares on the open market
by the government development agency. The latter
course seemed facilitated by the fact that the price
of shares had been depressed since the elections,
and further economic pressures could be created
by allowing wage increases but forbidding any rise
in prices. The legal adviser to the government,
Eduardo Novoa, also outlined other "legal loopholes"
in existing Chilean law which could be used for
"temporary" takeovers of companies, including
"intervention" because of labor disputes and "requi-
sition" because of a "breakdown in supply of an
article of prime necessity."

government control of the economy and of the excess
profits that the private sector had used for luxury
consumption or had sent out of the country as profit
remittances to foreign companies. At the same time,
the fact that the policy remained within the letter,
it not the spirit, of the law meant that intervention
by the military was unlikely.
In these, Debray declared that "in the last, analysis
and until further notice, political power comes out
of the end of a gun," and Allende repeatedly stated
that his differences with apostles of violence like Ché
Gurvara were only "tactical," because the Chilean
situation required that he observe legality "for the
time being." Allende himself organized an armed
personal bodyguard, the so-called GAP (Grupo de
Amigos Personales), and-we now know-as early
as December 1971 received reports on the illegal
importation and distribution of arms to the MIR and
to his bodyguards.'
While there were thus intermittent hints of revo-
lutionary alternatives, Allende's basic economic
strategy was "socialist consumerism,"⚫ combined
with a rapid expansion of state control in industry,
trade and agriculture, and his basic political strategy
Allende's constitutionalist and legalist strategy
was not universally accepted within his coalition.
Most of his own Socialist Party-beginning with its
newly elected General Secretary, Senator Carlos
Altamirano--and several other groups further to the
left, such as the MIR (Movimiento de la Izquierda
Revolucionaria-Movement of the Revolutionary
Left) and the VOP (Vanguardia Organizada del
Pueblo Organized Vanguard of the People), were
openly doubtful about the wisdom of relying on elec.
tions and "bourgeois legality" to achieve power and

Immediately evident from the figures for 1971. In-
dustrial growth had reached 8.3 percent, agrarian
production (based on plantings before Allende's
accession to power) had increased by 5.3 percent,
and unemployment had dropped to record lows. The
Communist Party in a report to a Popular Unity
"conclave" in early 1972 warned that "very strong
inflationary pressures could make our situation
acute," but the government took no action to deal
with the problem. The continuing optimism ci gov
ernment policymakers at this time was expressed
at a Round Table in Santiago sponsored by the Uni-
versity of Sussex and the Chilean Planning Office in
March 1972. In the course of discussion Radomiro
Tomic, the defeated Christian Democratic presiden-
tial candidate, asserted that the Allende government
had committed a "fatal political error" in failing to
establish an "institutional majority" in the Congress
through a "far-reaching agreement between socialists
inspired by Christianity and those inspired by
Marxism—that is, between the Christian Democrats
and Popular Unity-in the period following the 1970
presidential election." Allende's representatives con-

fidently replied that "with a gradual heightening of
the political consciousness of the proletariat, there
seemed to be no obstacles in the internal logic of
the Chilean bourgeois state to prevent the workers'
winning sufficient strength to gain control of the
legislature as well as the executive." "
On the political front, there were individuals and.
groups on both sides who attempted to stem the
movement toward polarization, which they correctly
foresaw would lead to the breakdown of Chilean
institutions. Two important efforts to arrive at a com-
promise on the issue of the constitutional amend-
ment on the "Three Areas of Property" were made in
the first part of 1972. In April the Left Radicals, who
had entered the Allende government in January,
carried on lengthy negotiations with the Christian
Democrats to hammer out a satisfactory agreement
on this issue, only to have it rejected by the top
command of the Popular Unity coalition parties. The
Left Radicals responded by leaving the government
and joining the opposition, a move Allende described
as "a stab in the back."" A second set of negotia-
tions in June between the head of the Christian
Democratic Party and Allende's Minister of Justice
broke down when the time limit set by the Christian
Democrats expired and the PDC leadership refused
to extend it.
The two sets of negotiations seem to have col-
lapsed for related reasons. In April the left wing of
the Popular Unity coalition was unwilling to accept
a compromise which would slow down or stop the
forward movement of the government nationalization
prograin, while in June the right wing of the
Christian Democrats could point to an impending
by-election in mid-July as a reason for discontinuing
discussions. Both cases illustrated a general prob-
lem posed by the Chilean multiparty system. Once
political conflict became polarized, the extremes
held the rest of the opposing coalitions hostage and
prevented what could have been a convergence of
views in the center.
The negotiations were interspersed with a series
of demonstrations and counterdemonstrations by
the government and the opposition which always
stopped just short of open violence. Several ob-

was an expansion of the electoral base of the Allende
coalition by an appeal to the material interests and
the class consciousness of the lower classes. It was
the interaction of the various elements of this politi
cal and economic strategy that finally produced the
breakdown of Chilean constitutionalism and the
intervention of the armed forces that the extreme left
of the Allende coalition had been predicting all along.
Initial Success
At the outset, the new economic policy was
astoundingly successful, although it had within it
the seeds of future disaster. Income redistribution
stimulated demand, while price controls and an arti-
ficially low exchange rate kept prices down. As a
consequence, a mini-boom ensued. By March 1971
the Sociedad de Fomente Fabril (Association for the
Development of Manufacturing), representing
Chilean business and industry, admitted that produc-
tion had increased by 6.3 percent over the figure
of 12 months before, and by May that figure had
reached 13.5 percent. The Institute of Economics
of the University of Chile later reported that unem-
ployment in the Santiago area dropped from 8.3
percent in December 1970 to 5.2 percent in June
1971 and declined further to an unusually low 3.8
percent by the end of the year. The Consumer Price
Index stopped climbing entirely in December 1970
and had only increased by 6 percent by the time
of the municipal elections of April 1971-its lowest
rise in many years. At the same time, salaries and
wages increased by 27 percent in real terms.
This wave of economic prosperity-combined
with the absence of the political repression that
some rightists had predicted would result from a
victory by the Marxists-led many, particularly in
low Income groups, to vote for the candidates of the
Popular Unity coalition in the April municipal elec-
tions. Allende's own Socialist Party bettered its elec.
toral showing in the 1969 congressional elections by
nearly 100 percent (a jump from 12 percent to 22
percent of the total), and the candidates of all the
parties supporting Allende received about 50 per-
cent of the vote, as compared with the 36 percent
which the President himself had received only seven
months before. Yet, gratifying as the results were,
the coalition was still a few votes short of the abso-
lute majority that Allende required to win a plebi-
scite on a constitutional amendment. He was later
criticized for not calling the plebiscite at the time
when the regime's popularity was at its highest
point,' but in retrospect it does not appear at all
certain that he would have won-particularly since
by the time that the constitutional prerequisites for
such a vote had been fulfilled, the economic and
political situation would have been much less favor-
able.
The period after the municipal elections now ap-
pears to have been crucial for the long-term survival
of the regime. The Right was still in disarray, the
Christian Democrats, had elected a compromise
leadership which was not committed to either of the
party's wings, and the short-run economic and politi-
cal indicators were favorable. Yet, instead of taking
action on the economic front to stem the loss of
foreign reserves and to dampen inflationary pres-
sures-and on the political front to prevent the
movement of the Christian Democrats into an alli-
ance with the right-wing opposition parties-the
regime continued its previous policies, confidently
assuming that in the long run "the people" would
support it and ignoring the warnings of "bourgeois"
economists that the loss of foreign reserves, the ex-
Spansion of demand, and the sharp decline in invest-
ment would produce disastrous consequences in the
following year.
Political Polarization
The hardening of the Christian Democratic posi-
tion began in mid-1971. It was accelerated in June
by the assassination of the former Christian Demo-
cratic Interior Minister, Edmundo Perez Zujovic, by
extremists, at least one of whom had been released
from prison by Allende upon his accession to power.
A month later in a by-election in Valparaíso, the
victorious Christian Democratic candidate received

This was counterbalanced however, by a split in the
other direction within the Allende coalition. Five of
the seven Radical senators (including two former
presidential candidates) and 7 of the 19 deputies
left the Radical Party (PR), and formed the Partido
de la Izquierda Radical (Party of the Radical Left-

PR policy resolution which the dissidents described
as "completely removed from the characteristic and
distinctive ideology of our party" and opposed to
"the interest of the middle social strata" whom the.
party had always represented. For a time, the PIR
continued to support the Allende government, but
within a year it had entered the ranks of the opposi-
tion.
In July 1971, the Christian Democrats had voted
In favor of the constitutional amendment national-
izing the copper mines, but from that point forward,
the pattern was one of polarization of Chilean politics
and society into two opposing blocks. The Allende
forces controlled the executive and pursued an in-
creasingly vigorous ideological purge of those who
were not entirely sympathetic to the government.
The opposition controlled the legislature, and in
October 1971. the Christian Democrats and the
rightist parties attempted to assert legislative con-
trol over the expansion of the public sector by voting
in favor of a constitutional amendment limiting the
use of the intervention and requisition procedures
and
requiring that all transfers of private enterprises
to the "social" or mixed sectors be carried out in
accordance with specific legislation adopted by the
Congress. This legislative act, referred to as an
amendment on the "Three. Areas of Property," be-
came the focus of a continuing deadlock between
the President and Congress that lasted until
Allende's overthrow in September 1973.
IM
Allende's refusal to accept the amendment or to
call a plebiscite to resolve his differences with the
Congress appeared to the congressional opposition
to be a decisive indication of his determination to
bypass the legislature in carrying out the Popular
Unity program, and from the time of the adoption of
the amendment onward, the Christian Democrats
began to cooperate with the rightist parties in op-
posing the executive. One method was to impeach
ministers for violation or (more often) nonenforce-
ment of the law. The first of many such impeach-
ments took place in January 1972. Another method
was to present a united electoral front against the
government. Informal cooperation between the
rightist parties and the Christian Democrats led to
striking victories in two by-elections in January 1972,
and a month later these groups formed the Demo-
cratic Confederation (Confederación Democrática-
CODE) to prepare joint lists for the 1973 congres-
sional elections. A third area of cooperation was in

marches and cernonstrations against the government,
the most famous of which was the March of Empty
Pots in December 1971, in which thousands of
housewives, mostly of middle-class background,
marched, banging pots to protest food shortages.
Those shortages had developed because the pre-
dicted economic difficulties resulting from the
Vuskovic policy began to emerge in late 1971: The
balance-of-payments surplus had been depleted at
such an alarming rate (in 1971 there was a deficit
of $315 million, while in 1970. there had been a
surplus of 891 million) that in November 1971 the
Allende government called a moratorium on payment
of its foreign cebts. Chile had already experienced
difficulties in securing loans from the Inter-American
Development Bank, the World Bank and the Export-
Import Bank as a result of its failure to compensate
the Anaconda and Kennecott copper companies
for the nationalization of their major mines. The
debt moratorium was bound to make it considerably
more difficult for Chile to secure foreign credits,
particularly for the short term.' In December 1971,
the Chilean government finally permitted a partial
devaluation of the Chilean escudo so as to decrease
the distortions created by its overvaluation, but this
created pressure on prices of goods manufactured
with imported components. Shortages of certain food
items especially cooking oil, detergents, sugar,
toothpaste, and cigarettes-were ascribed by the
government to upper-class hoarding and to increased
consumption by low-income groups; however, the
dislocations in the countryside associated with the
very rapid expansion of the agrarian reform (Allende
took over almost as much land in his first year in
office as Frei had in six years) clearly had something
to do with the problem as well, and the situation
could be expected to get worse with the harvest in
early 1972. A. 100-percent increase in the money
supply as a result of the government's deficit spend-
ing was also beginning to produce inflationary pres-
sures now that the unused capacity of Chilean indus-
try had been taken up by the 1971 expansion. Most
important, a sharp drop in investment (Allende said
it had declined by 7.7 percent, but opposition
economists claimed it had fallen by 24.2 percent)
meant that the spectacular growth rate achieved in
1971 would be sharply reduced in 1972.

joined in the conflict, protesting the failure of the
Ministry of Justice to carry out court orders, while
progovernment demonstrators denounced the viejos
de mierda--"filthy old men"-in the Supreme
Court. As it became apparent that there was no real
possibility of resolving their differences, the two
sides turned to the armed forces as impartial arbi-
ters, and the national holidays in mid-September
1972 were marked by rival efforts of the Congress
and the President to ingratiate themselves with the
military.
The political involvement of the military was
accelerated by the next step in the Chilean tragedy—
the October 1972 strike. Respectively termed the
"employers' lockout" and "the national strike" by
pro- and anti-Allende forces, it began far from
Santiago, in the remote southern province of Assen,
with a strike by small truckers. (Referred to by the
government press as the "truck-owners," the mem-
bership of the truckers' gremio-guild-was almest
entirely composed of owners of one or two trucks
who feared an announced plan to establish a state
trucking agency which would have had priority

termpted to keep factories going despite manage-
ment's efforts to cease production-and the October
Strike saw the emergency of "Industrial Belts"
(Cordonies) and "Communal Commands," which
seemed to embody the type of spontaneous "popular
power" that leftist theorists had spoken of as the
basis of a genuine revolutionary class consciousness
to replace the materialistic "economism" that had
characterized Chilean workers until this time."
When the workers seized closed factories, the plants
were usually "intervened" by the government; so
that an important result of the October strike was a
considerable expansion of the government-controlled
sector of industry and trade.
The most important outcome of the strike, how.
ever, was the direct involvement of the military in
the Allende cabinet. A condition of the settlement
of the strike was that the military take over key cabi-
net posts. This resulted most notably in the assign-
ment of the Ministry of the Interior to the Com-
mander-in-Chief of the Army, General Carics Prats,
so as to assure that the congressional elections
scheduled for March 1973 would be carried on freely
and impartially.
The involvement of the military and the prepara-
tions for the March elections brought about a lull
in the escalation of political conflict in Chile. Inevi-

periods in factories. The ensuing uproar involved
the Catholic Church for the first time in formal oppo-
sition to the government and mobilized thousands |
of secondary school students in violent demonstra
tions in downtown Santiago. Stories of fierce argu-
ments over the school proposals among the top
military officers (the military had left the cabinet
after the elections) filtered into the national press,
and a military delegation held a formal meeting
with the Education Ministry to express their opposi
tion. The controversy subsided only when the gov.
ernment announced that the proposal had been
postponed, pending further discussion.
Within the government, the debate continued on
whether to "consolidate in order to advance" (the
Communist position) or to "advance without com-
promise" (the Socialist stance). One Indication of
how the debate was resolved was the decision by
the government to use a constitutionally-authorized
"decree of insistence" allowing the cabinet to over-
ride the rulings of the Controller General of Chile,
Hector Humeres, who had disallowed the requisi-
tioning of some of the factories taken over during
the October 1972 strike. Conflicts also continued
with the judiciary over the executive's refusal to
obey court orders to return seized properties. On
May 26, the Supreme Court sent a public letter to
the President denouncing

[its] open and continual rebellion against judicial
orders... which signifies a crisis of the rule of law
[and] the imminent breakdown of the juridical struc-
ture of the country."
The stalemate between the executive and the
Congress over the constitutional amendment on the
"Three Areas of Property" was compounded when
the Constitutional Tribunal refused to take jurisdic-
tion over the disputed question of whether, in the
absence of a prebiscite, the Congress could override
the President's item vetoes by a majority or by a
two-thirds vote." A second constitutional conflict
along the same lines developed when the opposition
majority in Congress voted in favor of an amendment
to give farms under 40 hectares (about 100 acres)
in size an absolute guarantee against expropriation

and to compel the distribution of land in the "re-
formed" sector to the peasantry affer a transitional
period of two years: (The government had once again
used a loophole in the 1967 law to postpone in-
definitely the distribution of expropriated land by
individual title.)
In May the official price index jumped 20 percent,
indicating that the inflation was moving into a new
hyperinflationary stage. The one effort that the gov-
ernment had made to hold the line--its refusal to
grant a fuil cost-of-living wage increase to the El
Teniente copper miners on the grounds that under
their contract they had already received partial cost-
of-living increases--led to a bruling two-and-a-half-
month strike, which included a miners' march on
Santiago, mass rallies, and simultaneous one-day
general Strikes for and against the government in
mid-June. By that time, Allende was once more
ready to resort to military Involvement in the cabinet
to restore social peace.
Last Stage-Decline and Fall
On June 29, the last act of the Chilean tragedy
began with an abortive revolt by the Second Armored
Regiment in Santiago. Apparently, several army
units had been in contact with Patria y Libertad, a
right-wing political organization, and had planned to
seize President Allende at his residence and to
occupy the presidential palace. The revolt was
canceled one day before it was to occur, but when
one of the officers of the Second Armored Regiment
was arrested and held in the Defense Ministry, the
Regiment decided to free him and in the process to
seize the presidential palace as originally planned.
General Prats, the Army Commander, used the other
military units in Santiago to put down the revolt in
a few hours—most of which were spent in negotia-
tion rather than shooting-but not before President
Allende has gone on the air to urge "the people” to
take over all industries and enterprises as a response
to the uprising of "a small group of rebellious mili-
tary men." The Central Labor Federation also urged
the workers to occupy the factories, and in one day
the number of companies taken over by the govern-
ment rose from 282 to 526. The "Industrial Belts"
that had sprung up at the time of the October strike
now achieved new importance. The spread of “peo-
ple's power (poder popular) had been seen by

Chile, Nathaniel Davis, remarked on the pattern of 1 political arena: Several additional ministers were
"brinkmanship" that the Chileans exhibited." Social
and political tensions increased-but as long as
economic deterioration was hot reflected in runaway
Inflation, the Chilean political system seemed able
to contain them.
The Turning Point
The strains in the system only became unman-
ageable in mid-1972, when the lid blew off the
fragile Chilean economy and let loose the pressures
that had been building up for at least a year. As the
deficit in government spending rose, particularly
because of its subsidies to the "social area," its
foreign reserves dropped nearly to zero, and the
growth of industrial output slowed down. Allende
replaced Economics Minister Vuskovic with Carlos
Matus and appointed Orlando Millas as Finance
Minister. The Matus-Millas team sought to "find
stability at another level," ordering a drastic cur-
rency devaluation, raising prices in the nationalized
sector, and permitting limited agricultural price in-
creases. The result was a sharp jump in the cost-of-
living Index, which climbed from 27.5 percent at the
end of June to 99.8 percent at the end of September.
A wage readjustment to compensate for the increase
In the cost of living only accelerated the inflation,
so that by the end of the year the official consumer
price index had reached 163 percent (see Table 1).
In September, industrial output began to drop in
absolute terms (i.e., not merely in terms of the rate
of Increase)-a drop that continued every month
thereafter until the September 1973 coup." Agri-
cultural production (excluding livestock) also com.
menced to decline, and mineral production regis-
tered precipitous drops, although copper production
rose by 1.3 percent for 1972 owing to the fact that
a number of new mines came into operation. (On
other elements of the worsening economic situation,
see Table 2.)
Chile's economic problems were paralleled in the

State Department, published in Jack Anderson's column in The

that "the Chileans have a great ability to rush to the brink, embrace
each other, and back off." On the same point see Mauricio Solaún
and Fernando Cepeda, Allende's Chile: On the Politics of
Brinkmanship, Bogota, Universidad de Los Andes, 1972.

course of their crackdown, the military found arms

voked protects from the leftist partles.
At this point, the Chilean Communist Party and
the Catholic Church both concluded independently
that the only solution to the Impasse in Chite was
one more attempt at an agreement between the
Allende government parties and the Christian Demo-
crats. The Cornmunists initiated a campaign against
civil war almost simultaneously with a statement by
the Chilean hierarchy calling for a renewal of dia-
logue. Probably in response to these pressures on
both sides, two lengthy discussions took place on
July 31 between UP and PDC representatives. Both
Allende and the Christian Democrats agreed on the
necessity of enforcement of the Arms Control Law,
but disagreement continued on the constitutional
reformis Allende offered to sign the amendment on
the "Three Areas of Property" in return for a con-
stitutional amendment specifying that the Congress
could only override presidential vetoes of constitu-
tional amendments by a two-thirds vote. He also
proposed the establishment of joint committees to
work out further agreements. However, the Christian
Democrats denounced these proposals as "dilatory"
and broke off the negotiations.

to re-enter the cabinet in order to settle the strike.
» Allende's personal bodyguard had organized courses in arms-
training at his vacation nouse outside of Santiago. The MAPU began
arms-training in December 1972, and the Radicals old so in July 1973.
The armed forces were aware of this at least by the end of July.

Allende in Retrospect
Trucks stand idle outside Valparaiso, Chile on Sep-
tember 8, 1973, the 44th day of a paralyžing trans-
portation strike.
-UPI.
On August 9 Allende swore in what he called a
"national security cabinet," with General Prats as
Defense Minister, Air Force Commander César Ruiz
as Minister of Transport (the ministry which would
deal with the striking truckers), and the heads of
the Navy and of the National Police in other cabinet
posts.
Almost coincident with the entrance of the mil.
Itary into the cabinet, the naval establishment be-
came involved in a serious conflict with the left wing
of the Allende coalition. On August 7, the naval
Intelligence arm announced the discovery of a plot
to carry out an enlisted men's revolt on August 11 in
Valparaíso and Concepción. The announcement
accused PS Secretary General Carlos Altamirano,
MAPU leader Oscar Garreton, and Miguel Enriques.
head of the MIR, of being the "intellectual authors"
of the revolt and demanded the lifting of the con-
gressional immunity of the first two, who sat respec-
tively in the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies.
Two days before the September coup, Altamirano
admitted that he had encouraged navymen to resist
their coup-minded (goipista) officers."
This attempt to subvert the hierarchy of a service
command from below was combined with maneuvers.
*3* it was an indication of the continuing press freedom in Chile that
newsstands in downtown Chile at this time contained a left-wing
publication headlined, "Soldiers, Disobey Your Officers," and a
magazine of the extreme Right with the headlines, "The Right of
Rebellion," "Rebellion and its Goals," and "Resistance to the Tyrant.”
by Allende to replace officers unsympathetic to him.
When General Ruiz resigned his cabinet post on
August 17 in protest against his lack of sufficient
power to settle the strike, Allende compelled him
to add that his; departure from the cabinet "im-
plicitly" carried with it his retirement as Air Force
Commander. This was correctly seen as an Allende
tactic to remove an officer opposed to him, and it
met serious resistance from within the Air Force,
provoking a series of actions which ultimately led
directly to the September 11 coup.
On August 20, top Air Force officers met to decide
whether to resist Allende's action. By evening. Ruiz'
had persuaded them to accept it on the condition
that Allende appoint the second-ranking officer.
General Gustavo Leigh, as Air Force Commander and
name another Air Force general to the cabinet (so
that Allende could not repeat the same maneuver
with Leigh). The next night the wives of high-ranking
military officers, including those of six generals..
gathered in front of Generál Prats' house to present
a letter asking for his resignation. When the demon-
stration was broken up by police tear gas, it pro-
voked such dissension in the armed forces that on
the following day General Prats decided to resign
both as Defense Minister and Army Commander. He
was joined by two other generals who, with Prats,
had led the military forces that had quelled the
tank-regiment revolt in June.
The resignation of what appeared to be the last
defenders of Allende in the army now meant that
all three services were opposed to the President. It
coincided with the adoption on the same day of a
"sense of the house" (acuerdo) resolution by the
Chamber of Deputies directed at the President and
the military ministers, drawing their attention to
"the serious breakdown of the constitutional and
tegal order."" The resolution criticized the Allende
government for repeatedly bypassing the legislature
through the use of legal loopholes and for refusing
to promulgate the constitutional reforms vc'ed by
the Congress. It accused Allende of ignoring judicial
orders, encouraging illegal seizure of property, perse-
cuting opposition labor groups, and supporting
illegal paramilitary organizations. In conclusion, it
stated that the listed actions constituted a "serious
breakdown of the constitutional and legal order of
the Republic" and urged the military ministers to
"put an end to the de facto situations listed above
which violate the Constitution and the law" or be

sional character of the armed forces."
In its original form, the resolution had declared
the Allende government to be illegitimate, but the
acuerdo had later been softened in order to secure
the support of the Christian Democrats. Yet its effect
was still to give a congressional green light to the
military, and Allende immediately so interpreted it.
He replied to the motion by accusing the Congress
of "promoting a coup d'état by asking the military
forces to make governmental judgments Inde-
pendently of the authority and direction of the
President"; he also pointed out that according to
the Constitution the only way that the Congress.
could decide on the legality of the President's con-
duct of his office was through. Impeachment by a
two-thirds vote."
The congressional vote was echoed by several
professional associations. The Medical Association
called on their "colleague" Allende to resign-a
request that was echoed by the Federation of Pro-
fessionals (CUPROCH)---and resignation petitions
were circulated in Santiago. The Lawyers' Association
Issued a declaration which-"without attributing a
malevolent intention" to the President-asserted an
"incompatibility between the institutional framework
within which he is supposed to exercise his office.
and the actions which he feels obliged to carry out

to be incapacitated (impedido) in the exercise of his
functions as he understands them," the statement
suggested that he could be removed from office
under Article 43 of the Constitution, which author.

The Coup
Exactly when the decision to carry out the coup
was made is not yet certain, but it evidently was
reached in the days following Prats' resignation.

of any emergency, and it only required a signal to

During the same weekend, Allende met with the

the holding of a plebiscite on his conduct of office.
Although this step was reportedly opposed by the

To justify their action, the military commanders
broadcast a communiqué to the nation. While ad-
mitting that the Allende government had initially
come to power by legal means, they announced that
it had "fallen into flagrant illegitimacy" by violating
fundamental rights, by "artificially fomenting the
class struggle," by refusing to implement the de-
cisions of the Congress, the judiciary and the
Controller-General, by causing a critical decline in
agricultural, commercial and industrial activity in
the country, and by bringing about a state of in-
flation and anarchy which "threaten the internal and
external security of the country." The coup leaders
concluded:
These reasons are sufficient in the light of classical
doctrine . . . to justify our intervention to depose a 1
government which is illegitimate, immoral, and un-
representative of the overwhelming sentiment of the
nation."

the Chilean people over the single pi.. Allende rádio
station that had not yet been shut down by the
military. He began:
This is surely the last time that I will be able to speak
to you.
. My words are not spoken in bitterness
but disappointment. In the face of these events /
can only say to the workers, "I am not going to
resign." At this historic juncture I will pay with my
life for the loyalty of the people.
Blaming "foreign capital, Imperialism, and reaction"
for persuading the armed forces to break with their
tradition, he said:
• •
History will judge them. My voice will no longer
come to you, but it does not matter. You will con-
tinue to hear it; it will always be among you. At the
least, you will remember me as an honorable man
who was loyal to the revolution."
At 11:00 a.m., the coup leaders permitted those
who wished to do so to leave the building, and-
except for his personal secretary-all the women,
Including Allende's pregnant daughter, left. The
military also offered the President and his family
safe conduct out of the country if he would sur-
render. Allende rejected the offer. The Air Force
then sent in Hawker Hunter bombers, which re-
peatedly hit the palace with rockets and set fire to
large portions of it. Finally, shortly after 1:30 p.m.,
Allende decided to discontinue the resistance, and
the members who had been with him left the build-
ing in single file, led by the secretary carrying a
white flag. Allende stayed behind and, sitting on
a sofa in a reception room on the second floor, put
Iwo bullets into his head. The automatic rifle that he
used was a gift from Fidel Castro."
Conclusions
Since the coup, comments in the world press
representing widely divergent political postures have
cited the Chilean case as proof that the hope of
achieving Marxist socialism through democratic
means is a vain one. Yet most people have failed to
note two fundamental errors of the Allende policy.
neither of which was essentially related to the
: attempt to establish democratic socialism:
(1) As noted at the outset, the very quotation from
Engels that Allende cited at the beginning of his
administration to justify , course states as a pre-
requisite "the support of the majority of the people."
Allende acted as if he had that support; but even
at the highest point of his popularity in the April
1971 elections, he never achieved it. Moreover, his
policy of deliberate class polarization, aimed at ex-
panding his electoral base, was more successful in
pitting professional and middle-class groups against
him than in widening his support among workers,
peasants and low-income groups.
2) Marxist economists and policymakers have
always placed primary emphasis on investment and
the expansion of the productive capacity of the
economy. By contrast, the Allende policymakers
emphasized increases in consumption and cornbined
this with a headlong rush to take over industry and
agriculture-a course far removed from the "two
steps forward, one step back" of Lenin. The conse-
.quences of these policies after their deceptive initial
success were massive government deficits, runaway
inflation, and a near-breakdown of the economy.
(The argument that Allende's economic problems
were the result of a shortage of foreign credit does
not really hold water, since they were caused by
policies initiated before the foreign squeeze and
since, in any event, Allende's regime managed to
'
secure enough foreign credits from Latin American,
European, Soviet and Chinese sources to increase
the Chilean foreign debt from $2.6 billion to $3.4
billion in less than three years. Much of the new
indebtedness was to Western Europe and other Latin
American countries. Surprisingly, Chile's debt to the
USSR, China and Eastern Europe increased only from
$9 million to $40 million between 1970 and
1973.")

Allende in Retrospect
Specific aspects of the Chilean system also made
the Allende experiment a particularly difficult one.
He was able to come to power in the first place
because of Chile's deeply-rooted commitment to the
democratic system and because the Marxist parties
were able to mobilize a part of the proletariat and
the peasantry, and he had at his disposal many
instruments for state control of the economy which
had been developed by previous administrations
since the 1930's. However, he was required to
operate within an institutional system which included
frequent and staggered elections, proportional rep.
resentation, and a multiparty system which made
majority rule very difficult and often gave veto pow-
ers to the extremes of Right and Left. The economy
had been characterized for nearly a century by a
chronic tendency to inflation, and successive govern-
ments had consistently ignored agriculture in the
Interest of securing urban electoral support. The
most important systemic constraint of all, of course,
was the existence of a professionalized and insti-
tutionally-toyal military which was unresponsive to
the ideological blandishments of the Left."
• The immediate causes of the military intervention
are apparent from the preceding account. In the last
part of 1972, the military were drawn into Chilean
politics by both sides and became as polarized as
the rest of Chilean society-with the overwhelming
majority joining the opposition to Allende. The con-
flict over education in March-April 1973 height-
ened that polarization just at the time the military
were attempting to extricate themselves from politi-
cal Involvement. Then the expansion of arms
searches in mid-1973 revealed the extent to which
Chile was becoming an armed camp on the verge
of civil war. Finally, the efforts to subvert the existing
military hierarchy by a combination of leftist activ-
ity among enlisted men and presidential maneuver-
ing with promotions and retirements provided the
classis scenario for a coup d'état.
The Socialists always believed that they could convert the
military to their outlook. This is strikingly revealed in Socialist Party
documents published in the Libro Blanco, pp. 124-30.
One can also relate Allenge's difficulties to the
inherent contradictions in the Marxist theory to which
he appealed.. At the same time that he proclaimed
his faith in a democratic, pluralist and libertarian
transition to socialism, many of his Marxist-sup-
porters spoke and acted on the basis of a belief in
the inevitability of armed confrontation. With his
knowledge, they armed themselves and-what was
worse-talked incessantly about revolution. The re-
peated statements of Régis Debray and others that
the observance of the rules of "bourgeois" legality
was only a tactic until the balance of forces had
improved was hardly likely to persuade doubters of
the sincerity of Allende's commitment to democracy.
When the importation and distribution of arms was
combined with efforts to reorganize education along
ideological lines, to subvert military discipline, and
to rearrange the hierarchy of command, it is not
altogether surprising that the military finally took
altogether
action.
=
A positive evaluation of the Allende years would
certainly credit him with a sincere effort to raise
the living standards of low-income groups and to
involve them actively in the determination of their
own future. It would likewise stress the continued
existence of freedom of expression for all points of
view in Chile right up to the coup. A more negative
assessment would ask whether the low-income
groups in Chile genuinely benefited from an eco-
nomic policy which after the first half of 1972 pro-
duced hyperinflation, a continuous drop in agri-
cultural and industrial production, and a reduction
in the real value of wages and salaries. Even more
critically, one could inquire who has suffered the
most in economic and in human terms as a result of
the breakdown of the Chilean system-the Marxist
politicians, many of whom were able to escape or
go into exile, or the workers, peasants and slum-
dweilers they claimed to represent, who are now
paying the price of the Allende regime's mistakes
in the form of the hardships imposed by sharply |
reduced consumption and the strictures of dracon-
ian military rule.

Kremlin's Hand in Allende's Chile
by JAMES THEBERGE
Why did Salvador Allende's revolutionary gov-
ernment end in a bloodbath despite Soviet sup-
port and the plaudits of the world's left-wing
extremists, who saw in Chile a new puth for
Socialism's merch to power? ·
James Theberge, who is Director of the Letin
American Department of the Georgetown Uni-
versity Center for Strategic and International
Studies, shows how Moscow, the "big brother”,
though eager to exploit this opening in Latin
America to the full, disagreed with Allende's
headlong methods, and while warning him of the
growing economic chaos denied him enough
financial aid.
In 1935, Moscow dispatched Eudocio Ravines.
a brilliant Peruvian Communist organizer, to Chilo
to implement the "united front" and "anti-fascist
popular frent" strategy that had replaced, the
ultra-loft strategy of the Comintern. Since that
time the Chilean Communist party generally has
followed a strategy of broad aliance and limited
I aims, although the Cuban revolution led to a
radicalisation of party strategi.
The Chilean Communist party, one of the most
loyal pro-Soviet parties in Latin America, gave
unqualified support to the Soviet bloc invasion
of Czechoslovakia in 1960. While its fortunes
have shifted through the years as a result of
domestic and international developments, it un-
istintingly supported the twists and turns of Soviet
foreign policy and repeated Moscow's themes of
anti-imperialism and class warfare.
The party, at least prior to the military inter-
Evertion of September, 1973, was the best organ-
ised and strongest in Latin America. Between
1956 and 1960 it formed an uneesy alliance for
electoral purposes with the Socfclist Party, its
more militant Marxist rival on the Left. But in
1969 the Communists decided that a much more
broadly based alliance of teft-wing forces was
necessary for the transformation of the country
Into a socialist state and they played a key role
in the founding of the Popular Unity Front (a
coalition of six leftist partins) at the end of that
year. After the 1970 electoral victory of the
Popular Unity Front under Salvador Allende the
Communists became the single most influential
force within the coalition. It was a for better
organised and disciplined participant than its
(closest rival, the more idectogically unstable and
militant Socialist Party.
The ultimate aim of the party did not waver
throughout the Allanda period. The Communists
hoped to be able to take advantage of the weak:
ness of the democratic institutions to install a
"dictatorship of the proletaria:” under their
direction. Their Secrotery-General, Eduardo
Laborca, made this clear in his Corvalin 27

The Communist strategy, shared by Salvador

The via Chilena proclaimed by Allende scon

the West. The image that was officially propa-

democracy to disstroy it. He seemed to have
abandoned the via Chilena formula during the last

In the training of worker-revolutionaries for urban

at El Belloto, near Valparaiso, where the USSR
had installed a factory for the manufacture of

The Russian-built factory was kept under constant

arrested the Russians and three days later ex-
polled them from the country".
This clandestine involvement In training
guerrillas in Chile was an exception to Moscow's
official line of giving full support to the legal and
peaceful path to socialison. But the Soviet leader-
ship operates on the principle that since every
eventuality cannot be foressen it is better to take
advance measures which might "contradict" the
official line than to be sorry later. In Chile there
clearly were some advantages in having some

The Soviet Union offered to supply $300
million in military equipment to Allende in 1971,
but the military refused the offer and decided to
continue to obtain arms from the United States
and other Western suppliers. The anti-Communist

the Soviet prass. But the Moverment of the Revo-
lutionary Left (MIR), an ultra-left group that pur-
sued the armed path and hoped to defeat the
opposition forces in a violent confrontation, was
singled out for particularly scathing criticism. It
was charged with "revolutionary adventurism",
contributing to political instability and harming
the prospects of survival of the Popular Unity
government.
From mid-1972 onwards, Moscow realised
that the opposition to the Allende governinent was
growing and widespread. It was only the shrewd
and dilatory personality of Allenda-skilled in
maintaining a balance between the disruptive
forces within his own government--that held to-
gether the disintegrating fabric of society. There
was Soviet criticism of the irrational economic
managament, declining agricultural and industrial
production, accelerating inflation. and the
worsening balance of paymen's.
Soviet observers advised a slower take-over
of the economy, nationalising the large firms first
but leaving the smaller and medium-sized firms
alone for the tima being. In the last months before
the military coup they saw the handwriting on the
wall and urged a consolidation of the economic
gains already achieved, collaboration with the
opposition political parties (especially the
Christian Deinocrats), and avoidance of armed
conflict.

Collapse of Socialist Model'
The Soviet policy vis-à-vis Chile emphasised
cooperation in the political field, the forging of
an anti-US front with Chile, Peru and Cuba, and
expansion of trade and aid relations while res
fraining from polemics and interfering in Chile's
internal affairs (mainly through its influence over
the Chilean Communist Party). The Chilean Com-
munists were given moral and, material support
for widening the base of support of the regime,
but it made no difference to the final outcome.
The weakness of the Allendo regime, its fateful
Internal contradictions, official connivance in the
arming and violence of the ultra-left, the Weimar-
type inflation and food shortages, the growing
political polarisation and violence, and the fate-
ful alienation of the armed forces were the do-
cisive conditions that triggered the coup d'état
that led to Aliende's downfall and replacement by
a military junts on 11 Septernber, 1973.
Moscow was deeply disturbed but not especi
ally surprised. TASS admitted on 20 September
1973 that the "Chilean experierice was bitter and
dramatic," and Fidel Castro declared that he was
'vory upset by events in Chila" (the now military
junta had immediately broken off relations with
Havana). Moscow severed diplomatic relations
with Santiago and withdrow its ambassador and
embassy staff because of alleged persecution of
Soviet officials by the junta. After less then a
week in power, Chila's new mllitary government
began to teal the full blast of Sovint displeasure
and frustration, expressed in a well-orchestrated
and sustained propaganda campaign aimed at
isolating and discruditing the regiono.
The Soviet media accused the junta of "per-
socuting left-wingers with unparalleled cruelty"

Under the Allende regime, foreign policy was
reoriented, and the previously close ties with the
United States were replaced by strong political,
economic and scientific ties with the "socialist
countries," above all with Cuba and the USSR.
The first trip of the Foreign Minister, Clodomiro
Almeyda, outside of Latin America was to the
USSR and Eastern Europe, in May-June, 1971.
President Allende visited Moscow in December,
1972. Strong ideological and personal ties linked
the Chilean Communist party leaders with the
Soviet party leadership and Salvador Allende with
Fidul Castro.
President Allende's description of the USSR
as Chila's "big brother" (hermano mayor) was
no more figure of speech but reflected the expect
ation of his government that the USSR would be-
come the most important socialist ally of the
revolution and the main economic bulwark of the
regime. Moscow did, in fact. become the most

anco (such as foodstuffs) or untied convertible

finance the import of food, spare parts, and
machinery to alleviate local shortages, Moscow's
$99.5 million in short-term bank credits was no
doubt helpful but paled into insignificance before
the need to finance Child's import requirements,
which, for food alone, were running at the rate of
about $700 million a year when the Allende
regime collapsed. The Soviet leadership told

of the Chileans to the cause of socialism.
Refusing to give Aliendo the hard currency
credits he neaded to improve his worsening
chances for survival, Moscow contented itself
with organising solidarity meetings at home and
abroad in the hope that these demonstrations
would "reach the care of the Chilean people"
(Moscow Radio.13 August 1973). Allende's loyal
ally and "big brother" was willing to sell Soviet
machinery and equipment to him—that is, ex-
pand Soviet exports finensed by long-term credits
_ but denied him the short-term hard currency
credits he desperately needed.

A combination of circunstances
costly entanglement in Cuba, economic difficulties
at home, shortages of grain and foreign exchange
- led the USSR to eschew massive short-terrn
aid to Chile and to counsel a policy of self-help
to the Allende regime _ a theme repeated fre.
quently by the Chilean Communist party leader-
ship when referring to Soviet assistance. In the
final analysis Moscow watched idly while the via
pacifica was destroyed by the disastrous
economic policies, the circumvention of the laws,
and the tacit encouragement of the ultra-left by
President Allende and the Popular Unity govern-
ment.
Moscow pursued a dual strategy in Chile. At
the level of state-to-state relations it acted
cautiously, adopted a non-interventionist posture,
and encouraged anti-Americanism and independ.
ence from the United States. Since it realised
that the internal balance of forces did not favour
the armed struggle, the Popular Unity leadership
was united to maintain internal unity, reject the
"provocativa and adventurous" overtures of the
ultra-left, avoid actions that might provoke a civil
war or military intervention, adopt a more rational
economic policy, and consolidate the initial gains
of the revolution.
At the same time, Moscow did nothing to re-
strain direct Cuban involvement in the Chilean
revolution. Protected by a friendly. Marxist-
daminated government and its Marxist President,
Cuba transported large quantities of Soviet and
Czechoslovak-supplied weapons to the radical left
in Chile on the Cuban airline and merchant ships.

Allende
& the Myth Makers
David Holden
Political Realism & Revolutionary Romance
ENFIZLING AS IT MAY SEEM to say so when the
bloodshed of the Chilean coup d'état is
still so keenly remembered and the generals who
made it are riding unpleasantly high, the fact
remains that Salvador Allende died a lucky
man. In life he was a failure. Both his policies
; and his country were shattered long before the
and. But in death he achieved success beyond his
dreams. Instanty canonised as the Western
world's newest left-wing martyr, he became
overnight the most potent political cult-figure
since his old friend, Che Guevara,
To some extent, of course, the congregation
had already been prepared for this posthumous
elevation. In the three years of Allende's admini-
stration the "Chilean experiment" and the.
"Chilean road to socialism" had become fav
ourite topics of discussion among left-wing
groups in Europe, where Chile's supposed
resemblance to Italy or France had encouraged
the belief that Europe might, for once, foliow in
Latin America's footsteps instead of the other
way about. Many aspiring revolutionaries from
Europe and the United States had actually
joined their Latin American counterparts in
Chile in much the same spirit as their, dropped-
out contemporaries had hitch-hiked to Nepal
hoping for a glimpse of Paradise in action. By
the time of the September coup the military junta
claimed there were as many as 15,000 foreigners
of all kinds in Chile, actively supporting-some-
times with nolence—the "socialist revolution."
DAVID HOLD has travelled in Chile on several
recent assignments as Chief Foreign Corres
pondent for the "Sunday Times." Among his
regular contributions to ENCOUNTER are "South
African Notebook" (August 1970). "Day Trip
to Zanzibar" (September 1972) and "Ethiopia
Forty Years On” (February 1973).
These specially interested groups" or "indivi
duals obviously provided a ready network for
international propaganda in the aftermath of
Allende's death. But the shocked and, at times,
almost hysterical reaction to the coup went far
beyond such committed parties to embrace
many of the West's ordinary liberals and social
democrats. For them, as much as for the self-
styled revolutionaries, it seemed, a bright light
of world-wide hope had been extinguished in
Santiago; and from Washington to Rome, via
Paris, Bonn and London, anguished cries of
*Foul" rent the air.
THE OUTCRY IN BRITAIN was typical-and
instantanenme
:
Revolt Against the Ballot Box" for which the
Chilean armed forces could offer no excuse
(The Guardian, 12'9/73); as a "Disaster in
Chile" that would "set back the cause of social-
iamn and democracy everywhere" (New States
man, 14/9/73); and as "The Death of a Hope"
comparable, even, to the Russian invasion of
Czechoslovakia that ended Alexander Dubeck's
régime in 1968 (The Observer, 16/9/73).
Within 24 hours of the first, bare news of the
coup the General-Secretary of the British Labour
Party, Mr Ron Hayward, was writing officially
to one of Allende's former colleagues to say that
it was difficult to express the sense of horror and
anger felt by the British Labour movement "as
the aspirations of the working people of Chile—
shared by so many others around the world-
are destroyed at the hands of a few arrogant and
ignorant officers acting at the behest of those
who believe their right to rule is unchallengeable".
(The Times, 13/9/73). Mr Len Murray, General-
Secretary of the Trades Union Council, expressed
his shock and abhorrence with equal speed and
vigour. And Mrs Judith Hart, speaking as a
member of the Labour Party's National Execu-
tive, unleashed a torrent of assertions so passionats
as to suggest that her mind had come close to
being overthrown with Allende's government.
They ranged from the declaration that “the
democratic will of the people of Chile" had been
defeated by capitalist "collusion" (The Guardian,
17/9/73) to "for Socialists of this generation
Chile is our Spain" and "This is the most vicious
fascism we have seen in generations" (The
Guardian, 19/9/73).
: When the Labour Party Conference met at
Blackpool three weeks later these instant re-
actions had hardened into established orthodoxy.
The former Chilean Ambassador in London was
given a standing ovation when he became the
first non-delegate to address a Party Conference
since two Spanish Republicans were allowed to
do so in the 1930s. Resolutions were then carried
utterly condemning the military coup and the
precipitate action of the British Government in
recognising the military junta; demanding the
recall of the British Ambassador from Santiago
'and the withholding from the military régime of
all aid, loans, and credits; and calling on the
Labour Movement to campaign for the restora-
tion of democracy in Chile and to offer financial
and other assistance to the Popular Unity
(Allende's) movement (The Times, 5/10/73). My

now” (14,9,73). The change is almost ectoplas
mically vague yet simultaneously all-embracing
But what does it actually rest ea?
First, presumably, the celebrated meinorandum
of ITT which suggested ways of preventing
Allende from assuming the Presidency in 1970
and of toppling his régime if he did so. There is,
: of course, no doubt of this memorandum's
authenticity, nor of its appalling folly; and with
such organisations admittedly pushing their
~ conspiratorial notions at the heart of American
· politics it is not surprising that suspicions of
Yanquí skulduggery were aroused. But there is a
major snag for anyone who sees the memorandum
as evidence of actual dirty work: simply, that all.
Inquiries so far indicate that its recommendations
were never adopted. They were studied by the
CIA, where one department produced a con-
tingeɔcy plan based upon them: But neither the
memorandum nor the plan seems to have received.
assent at any higher level; and given the kind of
public exposure to which the workings of the
White House, the CIA and most other things in
Washington have been treated during the Water-
gate crisis (including the allegations of Nixon's
personal involvement with ITT), I am hard-
pressed to believe that if such assent had been
given it could have been kept quict until now.'
Secondly, in support of the American Inter.
vention theory, it is pointed out that the U.S.
maintained its contacts with the Chilean armed,
forces and continued to supply them with arms
when other American aid to Chule was sus
pended. Therefore, so the implication goes, the t
Pentagon was deliberately keeping open the
option of inspiring a military coup against an.
unwelcome government. But this is obviously a
two-edged argument. For one thing, an army
that is still getting its toys to play with is usually
rather more than less likely to endure the follies
of its ruling politicians gladly. And for another,
what would have been said if the Americans had
actually suspended arms shipments to forces
whose commanders were serving in Allende's
cabinet? The outery about "Yanqui imperialism”
and “Pentagon politics” may easily be imagined.
.
Thirdly, the strangulation of foreign aid and
credit is laid at Washington's door as a major
weapon in a cold war against Allende from the
start. At first glance this has more substance to it.
The U.S. certainly suspended further commercial
credits of its own to Chile after Aliende had
nationalised, the American-owned copper mines
on terms amounting to confiscation. As the major
power in the World Bank and the IMF the U.S.
also argued there against further aid for Chile; ·
and to the extent that it was successful it must have
added to Allende's financial difficulties. But it
was not able to prevent other Western countries
(e.g. Holland and Sweden) from continuing to
offer credit; it never persuaded Britain to clase
down its small aid programme; it did not exclude
the re-scheduling of most of Chile's foreign debt
repayments in 1972, and it had not prevented the
discussion (incomplete at the time of the coup)
of a similar re-scheduling for 1973. In short, the
U.S. influence may have limited Western aid and
credit but it was far from being able to condemn
Allende's Chile to economic purdah. In any case,
Chile was not one of the under-developed world's
hard cases, totally dependent on external aid and
credits for its survival. The wealth of its comper
mines alone ensured that in normal times it was

external pressure. Unfortunately, nobody with
even a nodding acquaintance with economics
could have classified the management of the
Allende government as anything but disastrous,
To a great extent it placed itself beyond the pals
for any but the most trusting-or dedicated--of
creditors. But even if that had not been so, and if
the blame for Chile's economic difficulties could
have boon laid fairly and squarely at Washington's
doir, Allende would surely have had small cause i
for complaint. It was, after all, his administration :
which announced its immediate determination to
“expropriate imperialist capital... realise a poky
policy
of self-tinating... and review, denunce and
repudiate, as the case may be, treaties or agrees }
ments limiting our sovereignty, specifically the
reciprócal assistance treaties, the mutual and
pacts, and others, between Chile and the United i
States" (The People's Unity-Basic PrograTUMS
of Government, 1970).
It was also his administration which promised
to "repudiate the agreements between us and the
International Monetary Fund" (The People's
Government-First 40 Steps, 1970). These dold
Intentions were never fully realised, it is true;
but they were expressed as official policy before
the United States or any other "imperialist”
power had actually done anything to embarrass
Allende's government. In other words; it was
Allende who decided to pick the quarrel. It seerns
nalve, to say the least, to complain that his
chosen opponents took defensive measures. What
else were they expected to do?

n
action, nevertheless, might be better em.
ployed in asking why Allende got so little support
from most of the governments which professed to
be his friends. Except for Cuba, which offered en
thusiastic (but not always practical) advice to
Allende, as well as supplying arms and training
for his militant Left, the world's established Marx-
ist` governments were consistently cool to the
"Chilean experiment." The farthest the Soviet

surprising. In the nature of things, Marxist

upon 'over-reaching itself in every direction.

the reasons for this fierce reaction would repay
study. Probably they included a happy chance of

of Western political protest had passed into
history or been shadowed by disillusionmurat la
the year or two before Allende's downfly, from
Viet Nam and Greece to Black Power coủ the
Student Movement. Allende's dramatic end
supplied a new cause just when it was wanted.
Familiar double standards were certainly in-
·volved. Nobody at the Labour Party Conference,
for example, thought it necessary to ask why
such a royal welcome should be offered to the
representative of a government which had in-
cluded one of the very few Communist partics
outside Eastern Europe to approve the Russian
invasion of Czechoslovakia. A Paviovian res
ponse to the very idea of "revolution" was also
clearly in evidence—and ninde all the more eager.
It seemed, by the fact that this particular revolu
tion had been taking place at such a safe distanco
in such sublimely foreign parts. There was
perhaps, a characteristic love of worldly failure,
too-for it was dificult to read some of the more
extravagant expressions of grief at Allendo's
death without sensing a touch of gratification at
the idea that Good hind once more succumbed to
Evil and so delivered another martyr unto
Heaven before he could be corrupted by the
practical demands of life on Earth. But most of
all, perliaps, the response seemed to stem from...
Ignorance and wishful thinking always the two
most powerful sources of political romanticism-
which left the facts of life in Allende's Chile
either unknown or ignored and the Geld wide
open, therefore, to the creation of instant myth.
Hence the composite picture, now accepted
throughout a wide spectrum of Western liberal
and left-wing opinion, of Allende as a genuine
social democrat of impeccable constitutional
propriety who met his end at the hands of a
fascist conspiracy on behalf of a minority "ruling
class" aided and abetted by the United States
of America.
To replace this romantic vision with something
approaching reality may already be impossible,
for myths undoubtedly possess a life of their own
immune to rational challenge. To attempt to do
so also may entail some risk of abuse, for it
seems to be a common assumption nowadays
that anyone who seeks a rational explanation of
a military coup d'état (unless it happens to
represent a left-wing interest) is necessarily a
fascist beast.
I SHOULD MAKE IT PLAIN, therefore, that I am
concerned here with Allende's Chile and not with
what has taken its place. I hold no brief for
military juntas, nor for the summary executions,
mass imprisonments, censorship or whatever that
the Chilean junta may have inspired or tolerated
during its early months of power. Indred, because
I happen to know and like Chile as a country and
count a number of Chileans among my friends I
feel some personal sadness at the country's
present plight. But I feel no surprise nor. I am
afraid, much moral shock. Military men will be

Chile was left in such a mess by Allends that

; have been achieved without violence by a
democratic government that was ready to work '
pragmatically within the constitution and with a
proper respect for what the economic and
political fabric of Chile would stand.
But that is not the point any more. What I am
concerned about is how the country came to its
present pass. And without withing to speak ill of
the dead, it seems to me necessary to say outright
for the sake of the living that the Chilean coup
was largely Allende's own fault and that the myths
with which it has been surrounded on the Left are
not merely a falsification of Chilean history but
a potential danger to the future of liberal and
social democratic politics in the Western world
as well. Indeed, what is most disturbing to me
about the fashionable Western reactions to events
in Chile is their revelation of the degree to which
revolutionary romanticism has combined with
left-wing cynicism in recent years to corrupt our
own politics. It is certainly "co accident" that,
for example, the British Labour Party which so
uncritically adopts Allende's cause is also the
party which has permitted its self-avowed
Marxists and utopian socialists to gain factional
positions of unprecedented power.
I will leave others to pursue that theme,
however. All I want to do is to try to set some of.
the Chilean record straight-or at any rate,
straighter-by looking in some detail at three of:
the main myths that now surround the end of ~
Allende and his famous experiment..
1. The American
Intervention Myth
THIS FOUND its most virulent expression in
Th
the equation of Allende's downfall with that
of Dubcek. Yet in the absence of any American
armed assault to compare with the Soviet invasion
of Czechoslovakia-let alone the fact that
whereas Dubcek's Parliament supported him
against the Russians, a majority of Allende's
Congress invited him to resign—there were only
stereotype suppositions to sustain it
In general, the American intervention myth
seemed to derive from that, characteristic Latin
American and left-wing scapegoat complex which
insists that the Yunquis are responsible for every-
thing (except, of course, anything good). Gar-
nished with historical fact (Guatemala, the Bay of
Pigs, etc.) this is frequently transmuted in Latin
American affairs into a plausible anti-American
smear; and the state of Washington politics in
1973 was, of course, guaranteed to give such a
smear extra credence this time. The New States-
man offered a fine example. "The likelihood is
that the trail will lead back to the Pentagon", it
assured its readers, “if a proper investigation can
ever be mounted. But in default of this it does
seem possible to say that Nixonism and its allies
were already too heavily implicated in the

memorandum became public property. Was it,
perhaps, because its operations there were mustly
losing money and Allende did not want to share its
financial embarrassmeats? Or was it that he knew the
company had given him an effective political stick to
beat his opponents with and he did not want to throw
k away by kicking the company out? Either way.
IT's apparent immunity from reprisal did not
suggest that to took in chaticage very seriously.

' but even if he had, it might not have worked.

A day for many years. To support a similar régio
in Chile would probably have cost even murc.
There was never the slightest sign that Mr
Brezhnev, or anyone else in the Kremlin, was
ready to accept such a burden.
.
To sum up, then, it seems to me that the Idea
of an American conspiracy to overthrow Allende
is both unproven and unnecessary to explain his
downfall. I am not saying, of course, that
Washington was not mlieved to see him go;
although I think some American officials would
have preferred to see him stumble on for sometime
longer in the hope that growing disillusionment
would infect even his stoutest supporters and
accordingly diminish, the chances of his being

him. But in general the American attitude scems.

Thou shalt not kill, but need'st not striveĭ
Officiously to keep alive....
A realistic Chilean government embarked on its
"road to socialism" would surely have bargained
for that much, and (on a truly Marxist analysis ·
such as Allende professed) it should have expected:
much more--that America would move in for the
kill as soon as possible. Yet while adopting a
deliberately provocative stance, Allende took no
steps to protect himself against possible American
reprisals, declined to compromise for the sake
of other Western help, and failed to provide
grounds even for his supposed Marxist friends
to help him.
It was magnificent, perhaps, but it was not
politics. At the very least, Allende must to
convicted here of a lack of realism that would
probably have been fatal to any statesman any-
where.
2. The Ruling Class
Conspiracy Myth
•he Ficture of Allende being overthrown
Tbby
by what has been variously described as a
"revolt of the privileged," a series of "bosses"
strikes" or a "conspiracy of the traditional ruling
class" contains so many misconceptions that it is
hard to know where to begin to sort them out.
One idea, however, seerns basic to them all:
that Allende and his Popular Unity coalition
were somehow the uniquely legitimate repro-
sentatives of "the People's Will" That such an
odd belief should have gained any currency
whatever outside purely propagandist circles is a
mark of the confusion that surrounds the
Chilean experience in the minds of many non-
Chileans. To judge from published comments,
such as those referring to the "defeat of the
democratic will", some of Allende's sympathisers
abroad seem even to believe that he not merely
enjoyed a massive popular majority of the vote
but was also the first President of his country to
do so.
- Yet the facts are beyond dispute. Chile was
and had been for many years a functioning
democracy with a constitution which vested
executive power in the President and legislative
power in Congress. Both in theory and is practice,
no doubt, there were serious weaknesses—as
reveal:d, for instance, in the inability of previous
governments to press through social reforms as:
swiftly ba, many Chillers would have wished.
But by con mon convent the system was the best
and most stable in Latin Amerion and it had
enabled Allende himself to contest the Presidency
unsupully three times before he finally won
it at his footh attempt in 1970. There was no
doubt of the legitimacy of that victory. But,
unfortunately for those who saw it as a unique ;
expression of "the prople's will", it was gained
only through a narrow plurality in which Allendo |
obtained just over 36% of the poll. His nearest |
rival, only a couple of percentage points behind,
was the candidate of the conservative National
Party, whose members in Congress opposed
Allende from the start. Another 23% went to the
third candidate, a radical reformist from the
Christian Democrat party, many of whose
members in Congress at first gave Allende the
benefit of the Coubt, hoping he would modify
hit avowed Marxiun in practice to a kind of
reformiim compatible with their own ideas and
H
the existing constitution.
In the mid-term Congressional élections of
March 1973, the Popular Unity coalition raised
its share of the vote to 44% (although this time i
the "legitimacy" was suspect owing to opposition
allegations of substantial electoral fraud). But
the opposition parties retained a large majority :

facts it secure plain that, so far froin representing
"the People's Will", Allende never actually ro

Interest. Only if "the People” are identified as
being those who voted for Allende, while the rest
-the majority-are relegated to the status of
"non-people" can any other interpretation be
sustained. But that, of course, is just what
is implied by the myth of the "ruling class
conspiracy."
IP THERE WAS a “ruling class” in Chile it was that
of the politicians and the surrounding establish-
ment drawn roostly from the narrow upper end of
Chile's prosperous middle class. Allende himself
and many of his ministers and leading supportas
were as much part of that group as, were their
political opponents. But, ironically, it was a group
that often suffered less than others from Allende's
socialism because its manbers on both sides
generally possessed enough cash or property to
exploit the black market at home or slip into
Breeable exile if things got too rough--in any
case, to survive (like Allende himself until his
death) in very reasonable comfort. But the people
who did most to overthrow Allende were rarely
of this group at all. With the possible exception
of some naval officers, the armed forces were
very much apart from the establishment of any
political colour; and even after Allende brought
the service commanders into his government they
remained aloof from, and remarkably little
known by, those relatively small circles in Santiago
which were accustomed to set the country's.
political tone.
Indeed, as events since the coup d'état have
shown, Chile's military men-like their counter :
parts elsewhere--were probably as contemptuous
of the politicians (and as ignorant el poûtics) as
the politicians were of them. They had stayed
outside politics for nearly 40 years, and if Allends

himself had not dragged Giem into the whirlpool i
they might have been content to remain that way.
But their position was made intolerable by the
President's own decisions. On the one hand, Uvey
were encouraged to turn a blind eye to the steady
growth of illegal, para-military forces under the
-command of the President's friends or others who
were more extreme in their revolutionary com-
mitment. On the other hand they were required
to serve. in his cabinet to maintain "law and
order” and reassure the country of the President's
constitutional propriety. On top of that they i
were threatened by attempts from within the
President's own circle to subvert their authority
within their own forces, as in the naval cod-
spiracy uncovered in July 1973, and the public
call for a naval insurrection by Allende's friend |
and fellów-leader of the Socialist Party, Senator
Carlos Altamirano, made only three days before
the coup.
A surer way can hardly be imagined of pro-
voking mutiny among responsible others, and
It is only surprising in retrospect, that it did not

countries it surely would have done. Yo ascribe

either of military men in general or of Chile's mili-
tary in particular.
I
SIMILARLY, THE 90-CALLED “bosses" strikes" whi:b
proceded the military coup were, in fact, nothing
of the kind. The lorry-men who paralysed half,
or more, of Chile's transport by their month-long
strike in September-October 1972, and their even
longer strike in July-September 1973, were mostly
owner-drivers who would have fitted fairly readily
into the Teamsters' Union in the United States.
They displayed the fierce economie and social pro-
tectionism typical of what in Europe or North
America would be called the lower middle class,
and they saw themselves threatened by galloping
Inflation and by what they believed to be the
Government's intention to destroy their way of
life through state control or ownership of their
services. Along with the small shopkeepers who
supported them-not forgetting the queue-weary
housewives whose famous "Saucepan March" in
Santiago was the most dramatic early sign of
revolt-they might be classed as the Poujadistes
of Chile. But by no stretch of the imagination
could they be described as representatives of a
"boss" or "ruling" class, or even as being
especially "givileged" in a social or economic
sense. Moreover, they owed little, if any, allegiance
to the traditional political groupings of Chilean
politics, although they obviously welcomed any
support they could get from them. On the
contrary, they tended to cut across the traditional
spectrum and look to new leaders, whether of
right or left. Thus, their principal spokesman,
Senor Leon Vilarin, was actually a member of
Allende's Socialist Party while others of the
_ leadership came from the Nationalist Party ranks
'Although even that was not unthinkable towards
the end, such was the chaos the economy had fallen
into. The last time I left Chile, a week or so before the
coup, I drove over the Andes to Argentina and at the
Chilean customs post at the summit of the pass I
found oficials taking a large Amencan car to pieces
and laying upon the snow-covered ground around it
one ton of copper ingots that had been hidden in
various nooks and crannies of the chasis. It would
have been worth around U.S. $200 in cash in
Argentina-a fortune, by then, in Cafean terms, of
about four mullie escudos on the black market.
"
or from no party at al
The members of the various professional
associations, like doctors, dentists, lawyers and
airline pilots, which joined the second transport
strike, were likewise not "bosses" although they
were certainly, in Chilean terms, rather more
“privileged." Their protest was probably more
ideological than that of the lorry-men and the
shopkeepers-it was usually their wives, for
example, who objected most forcibly to the
· Government's politically-inspired changes in the
school curriculum-but it was also provoked by
sheer exasperation and fear at the growing
threat to their professional status posed by the
Government's combination of administrative
inefficiency and dubious social priorities. For
example, Chile's economic collapse and inflation
not only threatened many doctors financially
but seriously frustrated their work. Some early
reports from Santiago after the roup made the
point that hospitals were appealing urgently
for bandages and drugs to treat the wounded,
as if that indicated that the number of casualties
must be overwhelmingly high. But bandages,
drugs, and other medical supplies had been only
sporadically obtainable in Chile for many months
beforehand. The daily round of the pharmacies
in search of the simplest medicines had become a
regular feature of Santiago life; and foreign
embassies had been driven to stock-pile their own
supplies, imported through the diplomatic bag.
for the treatment of the most normal ailments
among their staffs. It was partly in the hope of
ending that situation that many otherwise
conscientious doctors finally joined the movement
to get Allende out.
NOR SHOULD IT BE FORGOTTEN that some of the
most damaging strikes of all were those of
Chile's most influential blue-collar workers-the
copper-miners. The last lorry-men's ´strike was
immediately preceded by a two months' strike for
higher wages by miners at El Teniente, the coun-
try's biggest mine. Because copper accounts for
three-quarters of Chile's foreign earnings, that
strike probably cost the country far more in real
terms than the transport strike, whose costs to a
great extenf could be absorbed internally. Indeed,
as one West European diplomat remarked to me
in Santiago, the money lost in those two months
at El Teniente would have more than repaid
Chile's entire debt to his government-a debt
which Allende at that moment was trying to ro-
schedule for the second consecutive year.
It is true that the copper-miners were the élite
of Chile's blue-collar class and, no doubt,
wanted to keep it that way. To that extent,
perhaps, they may be deemed "privileged"—
like, say, coal miners or motor car workers in
Britain; although I doubt if that is what members
of the British Labour Party, or the New Statesman,
can have had in mind in embracing the “privi-
leged" thesis. But a more important reason for the
miners' restiveness, I believe, is that although
they were the most vital of all Chile's manual
workers they suffered far more than most of
their erstwhile comrades from the country's
shattering economic decline under Allende. Un- i
like farm and factory workers, they could not
supplement their official wages by selling the
fruits of their labour on the black market. The
farm worker who could take home a sack

© potatoes, a few chickens, or even a side of beef,
could make a good living on the black market;
even if his official wages remained stationary
while inflation roared plead. The factory worker
who was entitled to buy a proportion of his
factory's output at official fixed, prices could
(and did) seil that at six or ten times what helad
paid as soon as he lift the factory gate. Flut
miners could hardly find ready buyers for a stolen
truck-load of copper ore.* 1!
Thus the copper-miners were thrust, in effect,
into the same position as the lorry-men, the shop-
keepers, and virtually all of Chile's salaried
professional men and women: they were left.
more or less defenceless against the most vicious
inflation the country had ever experienced.
SOME APOLOGISTS for Allende have maintaised
that the degree of inflation was exaggerated or,
at any rate, little worse than was customary in.
Chile and elsewhere in Latin America. The truth
is that it was far beyond anything normally
endured in that continent. As little as nine
months after Allende came to power, when I
first visited Chile, the escudo had already fallen
from 20 to 40 against the U.S. dollar on the free,
or black, market. Eighteen months later, on my
second visit, the Government's own figuici put
the rate of inflation at 130% in a year, the money
lue was going up by 10% a month and the
escudo had fallen to about 350 to the black U.S.
dollar. By August 1973, the official inflation rate
was 323% and rising fast, and the escudo was
worth only 2,000 to the dollar-an effective
devaluation in less than three years of 10,000%!
Nor is it enough to attribute these catastrophic
rates to such adventitious or inalicious factors
as-and again I refer to published arguments-
falling world copper prices, the normal difficulties
of maintaining industrial and farm output in a
time of radical political change, or deliberate
American intervention.
On the last of these three I have already said
enough, I hope, to show that it was far from
decisive and that it was,, anyway, largely self-
invited. As to falling copper prices, the fact is
that after a fall in the first year of Allende's
Government, prices recovered until by the time
of his overthrow they were 80% above the level
at the time of his election. Had they not risen
so steeply he would almost certainly have falleg
sooner and probably would not have secured his
selative, short-lived success in the mid-term
elections of March 1973. The difficulties of main-
taining output in a time of change, however, were
real-unfortunately, far more so than Allende
ever seemed to realise.
To take just two examples: copper and milk.
Expropriation of the copper mines from their
American owners would, no doubt, have led in
itself to the withdrawal of American technicians
as well as of American management with some
consequent risk of losing production temporarily,.
at least. But this might have been overcome by
the promotion of trained Chilean managers and
technicians, of whom there was no shortage.
Alas, for Chile's national income, Allende not
merely nationalised but deliberately politicised
the mines as well. Jobs for the party boys were
handed out in thousands while trained Chileans
emigrated so that, after three years of Popular
Unity Government, mining manpower and costa
had risen by more than a third while mining

SUCH POLLYS were repeated everywhere as the
mantic pestures of self-styled revolution were
preferred to facing the facts of life. While overall
production in both agriculture and industry fell
disastrously, Allende simultaneously attempted to
redistribute the national wealth by giving Chile's
poorer classes more money to spend. They were
his constituency and they were properly grateful,
for many of them certainly had never had much
before. But you can't redistribute what you have
already thrown away; and as output vanished, '
so domestic queries grew longer, foreign debts
piled up, and the budget deficit expanded the a

I asked one of Aliende's chief economic advisers
what they were going to do to control a situation :
that was already locking critical. He replied,
with commendable candour, that he really didn't
know. "I know," he said, "what we ought to co-
we should impose an austerity régime ummanroW,
freeze wages, and ration essential supplies. But
how can we? We would destroy our own political
base..."
Precisely. In the end, rather than do that they
plunged on down the primrose path of promises
and illusions and practically destroyed the
country. The "ruling class conspiracy" was
the gloss that they and their supporters put upon
the reality of their own miscalculations.

all the other arguments revolve. Was he a
genuine constitutionalist? Was he a true revolu-
tionary? Was he--could he ever have been--both?
Allende himself, of course, admitted no
doubts. Repeatedly, he insisted that he was a
revolutionary and a Marxist, and that he intended
to establish at least the preconditions for what
he told Régis Debray would be "total, scientific
Marxist socialism." Equally repeatedly, he pro-
claimed his faith that he could achieve this end
by constitutional nieans, through the ballot box
and all it implied. That was, after all, to te the
distinctive. "Chilean road to socializin" of which
so many poople outside Chile cherished such
high hopes.
But no hindsight is required to see that both
theory and practice were riddled with contra-
dictions. Revolutions are born of, or generate,
sectional conflict-a fact of political life that
Allende acknowledged every time he spoke of
"overthrowing" what he called the "bourgeois"
state. But a democratic constitution rests upon
consensus—a basic acceptance of the fact that
the State represents more than a merely sectional
interest. The second permits retorn, but the fust
denies it; and there is no way of reconciling the
two.
All Allende's practical difficulties followed
from this simple distinction. Tiken seriously, his
constitutionalism micant that his programane
could only succeed it a majority would actually
'vote for it. But, elected as he was with only just
over a third of the popular vote and with a large
majority of Congress against hin, Allende had
neither a democratic nur án administratively
effective mandate for hit revolution. Indeed, in a
parliamentary rather than a presidential demo-
cracy, he would probably never have been able to
begin.
If he was to succeed within his six-year term of
office even in opening the door to revolution, let
alone establishing it as accomplished fact, he
had to transform his ininority into a majority.
But how to do it? For, if words nieant anything.
Allende's had to mean that he intended to replace
the existing, reformable constitution of Chile
with another that would be, of its Marxist
nature, irreversible. In other words, a system that
was admittedly democratic was to be used to
build another that would be effectively dictatorial.
This was asking the majority to hang itself from
its own gallows; and, not surprisingly, it declined
ALLENDE'S ATTEMPTS to overcome this basic
illogicality in his position were precisely what
ensured his ultimate downfall. Refusing to
abandon either his revolutionary rhetoric or his
professed constitutionalism he was forced to rely
more and more upon political illusionism. His
sleight-of-hand was often remarkable, as he
sought to outwit the opposition majority in
1. Congress by exploiting the letter of the constitu-
tion, using every legal loophole to force upon them
measures they did not want. But in the process,
inevitably, he destroyed the constitution's spirit,
so that his opponents became as ruthless as he
.
* Indeed, as I discovered for myself on a visit to
southern Chile nine months after Allende's efections,
local police forces there were under specific instruc
tions not to attempt to restore the firms to their legal
owners. See also Robert Moss's report in Escountra,
"Aliende's Chile", August 1973, and Alistair Horne's

was. At the start he won considerable opposition
support in Congresa for needed changes like the
nationaleation of the copper mines, land reform,
and the state's takeover of banks and major |

sentus could and would work within the existing
constitution. But, at the end, not a single member

his "habitual illegalities" and ware even joined
by the Supreme Court in accusing him of dis- i
regarding the rule of law. He hand cut away the
middle ground of Chilean politics, wrecked the
democratie consensur, and begotten the reality
of counter-revolution through his own addiction
to revolutionary slogans. .
Equally inevitable was the economic break..
down, which came from Allende's attempts to
enlargo-his popular base outside the political
institutions. Here his plan was two-fold: to buy
political support among "the People" through
massive wage increases and other bemüts and at
Ue same tune to squeeze the riddle class into
submission, or even flight from the country,
through wholesale nationalisation of their inter-
ests and the appointment of his own men to all
significant civil-service jobs. The two simply
cancelled each other out; for while the first part
of the plan raised vast new expectations and
demands, the socond diminished the country's
capacity to meet them. The whirling spiral of
inflation followed as a necessary result of
Allende's political confusions.
THE BASIC CONTRADICTIONS were compounded
by the fragmented nature of Allende's support.
His Popular Unity coalition was far from united.
In majority element was Allende's own Socialist
Party-a body that bore little resemblance
beyond its name to most of the democratic
socialist parties of Europe which so enthusias
tically espoused its cause. It was, in fact, a
revolutionary Marxist party that began as a
splinter of the more bureaucratic and Stalinist
Chilean Communist party in the 1930s, and in
recent years had acquired a fiery “New Left"
wing as well. Several of its leaders, like Senator
Altamirano, and many of its rank and file, con-
stantly urged Allende to "speed up the revolution"
without much regard for constitutional niceties.
The smallest element of the coalition was the
Christián radicals of various persuasions, some
of whom hoped to offer a bridge to the centre
of Chilean politics by cooperating with the left
wing of the Christian Democrats, but none of
whan ever attained positions of real influence.
The coalition's sheet anchor was the Communist
Party which, as business and administration
slipped into chaos, became increasingly im
portant as a source of discipline and strategic
thinking.
I'
T WOULD HAve been hard enough to drive
this troika anyway without either overstepping
the constitutional limits of government or anta-
gonising one or other of its elements and thereby
jeopardising the only "democratic" base the
revolution had. But Allende had also to contend
with the still more militant left outside the coali-
tion, led by the Movement of the Revolutionary
Left (MIR), which insisted on revolution now,
and by violence if necessary-as, in MIR's view,
it was

revealed as, at best, aquivoon. His officially™
rejected MIt's violence, yet he never permitted
the Armry to root out their para-military groups.
When they stigmatised his land-reform pro-
gramme as "inadequate" and seized hundreds of
farins at gun-point he rebuked them in occasional
spooches but did nothing to reverse their actions.*
When they hijacked lorry-loads of valuable
manufactures, to raise funds by selling them on i
the black market, he rarely tried to redress the i
crime. The left said this was because the MIR
truly represented "the People" against whom :
Allende dared not act. But the truth, I fear, was
⠀ more squalid. For one thing, the MIR had close
friends in the Socialist Party and in Allende's
own entourage whom the President did not want
to offend. For another, as long as their activities
did not actually split the Popular Unity coalition,
it was often convenient to see them pushing along
the revolution by unconstitutional means while
Allende denounced them in his role as a
constitutionalist.
It was not as if Allende was unable to deal
_ with the MIR when he had to. For example,
when a Mirksta force blockaded the Philips
television factory in Santiago in 1973 after an
unsuccessful attempt to hi-jack a lorry-load of
TV sets, they were allowed by the Government
to remain unmolested for ten days, although a
: police post was just across the road. Yet when
diplomatic representations were made by the
Dutch chargé d'affaires with the hint that his
country's financial aid might have to be recon |
sidered if this harassment of a Dutch enterprize :
continued, the Mirisias were hustled away.
without a shot in 24 hours.
•
"
A SIMILAR EQUIVOCATION was evident in Allende's
adoption of a personal arned bodyguard-the
first in memory to accompany a Chilean President.
It is true that the extreme Right in Chile was
quick to threaten violence as a response to
Allende's proclaimed revolution, and Allende
himself always maintained that he needed pro-
tection. But right-wing para-military groups were
never as big or as highly organised as those on
the Left; and, in any case, the proper reaction of a
constitutionally-minded President would surely
have been to call upon his state security forces to
protect him.
Instead, Allende formed a personal unit,
known as "the Group of Friends of the Pro-
sident." Trained, armed, and party manned by
"Cubans, it was led by known revolutionaries,
sympathetic to the MIR, including Alleade's
son-in-law. The existence of such a group at the
very centre of the State was not merely a pro-
vocation to the established security forces and an
affront to Chilean tradition, it was also an implied
rejection of the principle of constitutional rule.
DOUBTS ABOUT the real depth of 'Allende's con-
stitutionalisza were raised also by his personal
history and his language, both of which suggested
1
a romantic attachment to violence. He was,
after all, a founder and first president of the
Latin American Solidarity Organisation, created:
in Havana in the 1960s and dedicated to the
encouragement of armed insurrection throughout
the continent. He promised to "paiet Santiago
with blood" in 1970 if Congress declined to
ratify his election as President, and he repeatedly
1 tried to intimidate the opposition, inside and
outside Congress, with the threat of civil war.
These were not the actions or the sentiments of a
man dedicated to constitutional change, except
as a matter of expediency.
On the other hand, it was hard to see Allende
as a genuine revolutionary. He never looked
anything but the complete bourgeois gentleman. ;
A bon viveur, Corid but well-groomed, a snappy
dresser, with a twinkling eye for the ladies and a
good deal of personal charm, his strongest
political card was his skill in tactical manoeuvre.
· But as a strategist, a thinker, a man with a real
message, he was unconvincing. Towards the end,
as he appeared with increasing frequency on the
presidential balcony in Santiago to address
chanting crowds of his supporters with revolu-
tionary platitudes, he seemed to me to lose all
contact with reality, to have become an actor in
love with his revolutionary part rather than a
serious leader who knew where he was going.

IN RETROSPECT, I am inclined to think this was
always the truth of the matter with Allende.
Basically, he was a political romantic, dealing in
sensations rather than sense. He enjoyed his hour
upon the stage but he never properly assessed
_ the forces he was dealing with, either for or :
against him. He raised expectations on his own
side without commanding the means to satisfy
them, and he encouraged opposition on the
other side by his use of a revolutionary rhetoric
whose threats he also could not fultil.
.
At best he was muddle-headed; and time may
show that he was deliberately deceitful. Certainly
he managed to deceive a lot of people, including
himself. But in the end reality taught its own, hard
lessons. That you can't be a democrat and a
revolutionary-at least, not in a society that is
already admittedly democratic. That you can't
be anti-American and expect the Americans to
help you. That you can't pose as the people's
leader and kick most people in the teeth. That
you can't conscript soldiers into politics and
expect them to remain apolitical. That you can't
have inflation roaring out of sight and maintain a
base for social welfare. That, in short, the real
world is not Cloud-cuckoo-land. Down here,
you just can't have your cake and eat it.
It is sad that such elementary lessons should
have to be taught yet again at such tragic cost in
'Chile. But it is alarmning that so many people
elsewhere should evidently fail to grasp that they
are the lessons.
