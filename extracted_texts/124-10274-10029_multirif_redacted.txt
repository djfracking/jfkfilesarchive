At the outset Ir. Crescioli was informed of his
rights; namely, that he did have a right to an attorney, that
the interview was entirely voluntary and that he could refuse
to answer any questions asked of him. The interview included
the following questions asked by Messrs. Dick and Wallach which
are deemed pertinent:
In order to assess the experience of Special Agent
Crescioli, his prior Eureau background was requested. Nr. Crescioli
responded that he entered on duty as a Special Agent in September,
1954, and served in five field offices handling both criminal
and security matters prior to his assignment to FBI Headquarters.
During the period 1962-73, Mr. Crescioli was assigned as an FBI
Headquarters Supervisor handling substantivo cases in the
internal security area. From 1973 to November, 1974, he was
assigned to the Foreign Liaison Unit of the Liaison Section,
and from November, 1974, to the presont, he has been assigned
to the Domestic Liaison Unit handling liaison specifically
with the military and U. S. Postal Service.

Messrs. Wallach and Dick wore most interested in
ascertaining the procedure followed by Hr. Crescioli to secure
authority to be present at this interview. He was specifically
queried as to the names of the individuals who authorized his
attendance and what comments or instructions, if any, those
Bureau officials gave him. Mr. Crescioli responded by stating
that upon receiving a telephone call from Mr. Dick requesting
his appearance, a memorandum setting forth this request was
prepared by Mr. Crescioli and "walked through" various Bureau
lovols for approval. The idontities of Lureau officials approving
the memorandum were made known to these Staff Nembors, however,
it was pointed out to them that no particular comment of
pertinence to instant matter was recalled by Mr. Crescioli ns
having been made by any of these officials.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re:
Senstudy
It was readily apparent that they were asking these
questions with the thought in mind of requesting access to
certain informant files, the identity of which they already
had but did not divulge. They did state specifically that
the informant files in which they would have an interest
amounted to approximately ten and were all on informants
that had publicly been exposed for one reason or another
and were no longer being operated as current informants.
The indication was that the request would be for access
only to such files for review in FBI space.

Mr. Mark Gitenstein of the Domestic Intelligence Task Force! (
U. S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities.
The interview was conducted on 8/4/75 in FBI space and
lasted from approximately 2:00 p.m. until 2:30 p.m.
The interview was extremely general in nature and
dealt exclusively with general information regarding the
handling of informant files both in the field and at FBIHQ.
The questions asked dealt with such matters as what type of
files were maintained in the field and at FBIHQ regarding
informants and generally the types of information contained
therein. They were particularly interested as to whether or
not an individual informant file either at FBIHQ or in the
field would contain information which would specifically
identify informants other than the informant on which the
file was maintained. They also inquired whether or not there.
was a sub A section of each informant file maintained at FBIHQ
as was the case in the field. Questions were also asked as to
whether or not the individual file maintained at FBIHQ on
informants would run into several volumes. This inquiry was
answered to the effect that the size of the file would depend
on the activity of the informant, how long he had been
operated, etc.

TO STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS
WITH RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES
To the question as to what problems have been
experienced by Mr. Crescioli with the Postal Service since
assuming his role of Liaison Officer, Mr. Crescioli responded
that cooperation with the Postal Servico has been excellent
and no real problems have been encountered. Mr. Crescioli
explained that he has visited the Postal Inspection Service
on the average of once every two weeks since November, 1974.
He added that on occasion ho will be telephoned by an official
of the Inspection Service with a question regarding a national
security mail cover requested by the FBI, a question regarding
training procedures or a question regarding handling of
Freedom of Information Act requests. In his liaison capacity,
Mr. Crescioli would initiate the necessary arrangements to
have these questions resolved and the answer returned to the
Postal Inspection Service. In this same area of conversation,
Mr. Wallach asked Mr. Crescioli if he ever visited the Postal
Inspection Service to meroly "chat" with the Postal Inspectors.
Mr. Crescioli responded that because of his heavy liaison
responsibilities with agencies other than the Postal Service
he did not have time to visit tho Postal Service for other
than official reasons.
When asked if the various FBI field offices have
liaison representatives with the various Regional Postal
Inspectors in Charge, Mr. Crescioli responded that with
regard to national security mail covers, the Special Agent
in Charge of the local FBI office is the designated Buroau
liaison contact with the Regional Postal Inspector in Chargo.
ir
The above Staff Members were interested in ascertaining
whether or not national security mail cover checks were routed
through Mr. Crescioli prior to delivery to the Chief Postal
Inspector. Mr. Crescioli responded that these mail cover
requests are not routed through him for review but rather are
routed through normal Dureau channels prior to delivery by
Courier Service to the Chief Postal Inspector.

On the afternoon of July 24, 1975, K. William O'Connor, Special
Counsel in the Department, met with Deputy Associate Director Adams
and me to present us with a copy of the proposed procedures and to discuss
any amendments the Bureau might request. I asked Mr. O'Connor who had
approved this latest draft of the proposed procedures and he said that they
had been tentatively approved by the Attorney General and the White House.
I specifically asked him who in the White House had approved them and
he said that they had been approved by Mr. Buchen (Counsel to the
President).
Mr. Adams and I discussed the procedures with Mr. O'Connor
and suggested to him as indicated by my inked notation on the bottom of
page 2A that the word "use" used in subparagraph (d) should be further
defined by a footnote that would specify the limitations on information to be
provided the Committee and its staff concerning the identities of persons
to whom the FBI has undertaken an obligation of confidentiality. Mr. O'Connor
agreed to the proposed change and in our presence telephonically communicated
with John Elliff and obtained his concurrence in the amendment to sub-
paragraph (d).
REC-102
62-116395-528
Mr. Adams told Mr. O'Connor that the FBI was not agreeing
to the procedures in substance but that we recognized the authority of the
Attorney General in these matters and would abide by his decision that the
proposed procedures would be implemented on agreement by the Committee.
Mr. O'Connor said he understood that and he advised John Elliff that the
Bureau had acquiesced in the proposed procedures with the one amendment
described above. Mr. O'Connor departed indicating that he was going to
proceed to meet with the Committee and obtain final agreement as to the text
of the proposed procedures. The draft of the procedures is attached for the
Director's information.

(8) The staff and the members of the Committee may examine the
original materials to which the staff has been given access as
extensively as necessary, in the Hoover Building at Room 4171,
during normal FBI business hours; upon reasonable notice, special
arrangements may be made for access at other times.
(9) These procedures are adopted subject to satisfactory experience
in implementation. If after a fair trial the procedures herein do
not operate suitably in the view of either the SSC or the Attorney
General, the procedures may be unilaterally set aside by either the
SSC or the Attorney General and other appropriate and suitable
methods of procedure undertaken.

INFORMATIVE NOTE

Date
In connection with our responses to
the Senate Select Committee (SSC), the
White House has instructed that the Intel-
ligence Community prepare a briefing for
Senators Church and Tower of the SSC
regarding warrantless electronic surveil-
lances and surreptitious entries. During
meetings of the Intelligence Community, it
was agreed that NSA, FBI and CIA would give
the briefings. No date has been scheduled
for the briefings, although it is antici-
pated representatives of the White House
will monitor a preview of the actual brief-
ing to be given Senators Church and Tower.
During meetings of the Intelligence
Community representatives, to discuss the
contents of such a briefing, it was agreed
among representatives of NSA, CIA and FBI
that efforts would be made to avoid identi-
fying specific foreign targets of surrepti-
tious entries or warrantless electronic
surveillances.
Attached is a memorandum from CIA
advising that CIA has already disseminated
to the SSC information concerning sensitive
technical operations against certain
Embassies and diplomatic establishments in

WHERE SHOWN OTHERÄLSE,
On July 31, 1975, Mr. Dan Dwyer, Research Assistant,
Senate Select Committee, advised SA Seymor F. Phillips that he
had some specific questions to ask concerning his review of the
Classifying Guide, File's and Communications Division. Thereafter,
Supervisor Paul F Shea and Classifying Unit Supervisor Odell
Wheeler answered the following questions raised by Mr. Dwyer:
(1) Explain the difference in applicant mail categories, i.e.
67, 77, 116, 151 and 161? The various applicant type categories
were discussed with him. (2) What is the difference between
main files, general files and setup files? These definitions were
given to him in accordance with the manual%; in addition, our pro-
cedures for handling "O" files, "00" files and subfiles were also
explained. (3) When is a 62 file interchangeable? It was explained
to him that the 62 classification is interchangeable with other
designated classifications, for example, that incoming 62 material
could be placed in an existing file on the subject rather than
what you by
standard sublist. It was explained that a subnumber is assigned
to each one of our field offices and to each foreign country%; that
subfiles are used when it is anticipated that the volume of mail
will be sufficient to place the file in separate subs for future
ready reference to a particular area or locality. (5) What is
the meaning of the character of a case? It was explained that we
have utilized 185 classification numbers to date and that each of
these classifications has a corresponding character. The example
given was the 26 classification and corresponding ITSMV character.
(6) What is meant by the [134] classification being interchangeable
with the subversive list? It was explained to him that from the
185 classifications approximately 60 of these are termed subversive
from an administrative standpoint. The [134] classification which
designates a security informant is interchangeable with certain
subversive classifications on the subversive list.

1. In our discussions preparatory to the briefing to
be given to Senators Church and Tower, we have agreed to try
to avoid identifying specific foreign targets of the various
types of operations which will be discussed, although it was
generally recognized that it would be impossible to avoid
discussing the Soviet target specifically. I have recently
learned that the SSC Staff is aware of the fact (from material
turned over to them by CIA) that CIA "participated in a series
of electronic surveillance operations in the U.S." The infor
mation is contained in a single paragraph, which goes on to
say:
"Included among them are operations against the
Czech Embassy, the UAR Embassy, the Chilean Embassy,
the Soviet Consulate in San Francisco, the present
Soviet Embassy, the planned Soviet Embassy, and the
quarters occupied by the Chinese Communists in New
York City."
to
2. This being so, it can be expected that the Staff will
have brought this information to the senators' attention, and
I will be prepared to respond factually to questions with re-
spect to these operations, which of course were carried out in
pursuit of NSA requirements, and with FBI coordination and/or -
support.

3. Notwithstanding this regrettable breach in the pAUG 15 1975
ciple we have agreed to try to maintain, I believe we should
resist pressures to expand on the number of identified targets.

On 8/6/75, Daniel M. (Mac) Armstrong, III, who was
on the personal staff of former Acting Director Gray, called to advise
that he had been contacted by John Elliff. He had known Elliff casually.
during the confirmation hearings regarding Mr. Gray. Elliff told him.
that he was personally interested in determining background on two matters
which were: (1) the decision to abolish the Crime Records Division; and
(2) the Legal Attache program.
Armstrong told him that he had no knowledge concerning the
Crime Records Division and had not even learned of its abolishment until
after the fact. Armstrong referred Elliff to Dave Kinley regarding that
topic. Armstrong said that Elliff did not want to talk to him concerning the
Legal Attache program over the phone and said he would contact him in the
near future for an appointment to see him personally.
the
Armstrong said he was passing this information along to us in
order to keep us advised of his contacts with the Senate Select Committee
concerning his Bureau information which came to him as a result of his
Bureau employment.

Reference is made to Legal Counsel memorandum to
J. B. Adams, dated 7/29/75, captioned "Senstudy 75, wherein
the request of Mr. Johnson is set forth as well as the approved
release of Messrs. Smith and Cotter from their employment
agreement as it relates to the "Huston Plan. On 8/4/75
Special Agent Thomas J. McNiff attempted to contact Mr. Smith
at his home phone 301-262-1921. An adult female answered and
advised that she was baby-sitting for Mr. and Mrs. Smith who
are currently in New Mexico and are not expected to return
for an additional two weeks. Special Agent McNiff left his
name and office phone number with the request that Mr. Smith
call him upon his return to his residence.
Mr. Richard Cotter on 8/4/75 was contacted at his
home residence phone 256-7227 and advised of the SSC desire
to interview him within the parameter outlined above. Mr. Cotter
was advised that he has been released from his employment
agreement with the above parameter and that should he so request
a Bureau Agent will be made available to him for consultation
at the time of the interview. It was pointed out to Mr. Cotter
that during the interview there are certain privileged areas
concerning which he would not be required to answer questions,
namely: information which might divulge the identities of FBI
sources; information relating to sensitive methods and techniques;
information which might adversely affect on-going FBI investigations
and information which originated with other agencies, including
foreign intelligence agencies. Mr. Cotter concluded by saying
that upon being contacted by the SSC he would advise this Bureau
of the date of the anticipated interview and his decision as to
whether or not he would request that a Bureau Agent be made
available for consultation.

SUBJECT: Proposed Procedures SSC

Director Sec'y
This draft of "Proposed Procedures" has not been discussed
with SSC staff. It is intended to reflect the substance of the
discussion had on 7/21, in your office; and incorporates (as
underscored) additional language for the purposes suggested by
that discussion. Also reflected are the slight editorial changes
requested by the SSC in the draft attached to Senator Church's
letter of July 18, 1975.
These procedures are designed to permit broad access for
SSC staff to FBI materials at the FBI, or delivery of such materials,
if appropriate, to the SSC. The present scope of the access is
defined by the requests as received; those extant are the subject
of superseding redraft under paragraph 1. The prospective scope of
requested information is not restricted, but is subject to negotiation
as indicated in the amendment to paragraph 1.
The proposed modification of paragraph 3 will be the focus of
most controversy. The SSC will probably object to the withholding
of sources under paragraph 3(d) (proposed) saying that access to
information at the FBI offices is all that is required; that no
note on such documents can be removed from the premises of the FBI
under procedure 6; and that if they wish to pursue any sources,
the appeal provision of existing paragraph 6 should cover it.
Since that was the purpose of paragraph 6, and since paragraph 6(a)
was designed to focus on any real problem which might arise, the
scope of the stated problem under paragraph 3(d) may be seen by the
SSC as an attempt to withhold information from the SSC staff, and
delay the inquiry (since the Bureau would have to do considerable pre

deletions). Accordingly, I would expect SSC to assert (a) DQJ
does not trust SSC probity or security, and (b) DOJ is following
a dilatory and unnecessary tactic.
In anticipation of these problems, I have re-written
paragraph 9 to permit unilateral abrogation if the procedures
do not work. If actual information withheld is capriciously
defined, or if any lapse of good judgment occurs, I would expect
prompt abrogation by SSC and a very severe criticism of the
Director, the Attorney General, and the Department.
I think that is a high risk, and assumption of it places
a very heavy burden upon the Bureau, initially, and upon the
Department, ultimately.
My recommendation is that the proposed procedures be
attempted as redrafted, subject to Attorney General and White
House approval; but a vigorous caveat is indicated as to the
need for real restraint in the exercise of initial FBI discretion
under paragraph 3(d).

followed after consideration by the SSC of the specific exemption,

RE: INTERVIEW OF FORMER FBI
INSPECTOR DONALD E. MOORE
BY SSC STAFF MEMBER
This memorandum and its enclosure contain
information concerning an interview on July 28, 1975, of
former FBI Inspector Donald E. Moore by Mr. Loch Johnson,
SSC Staff Member. Mr. Moore entered on duty with the FBI
on March 10, 1941, and served continuously in a variety of
assignments until his retirement on June 29, 1973.
On advance notice from Mr. Johnson, Mr. Moore was
advised that Mr. Johnson desired to interview him at Mr. Ibore's
convenience relative to his knowledge of the Huston Report.
Mr. Moore was advised that he was being released from any
applicable employment agreement for purposes of the SSC
interview concerning the Huston Report. It was explained
to him that he had the right to counsel; however, the FBI
would be unable to provide private counsel. lle was also advised
that there were certain privileged areas concerning which he
would not be required to answer questions. These areas
concerned information which might divulge the identities of
FBI sources; information relating to sensitive methods and
techniques; information which might adversely affect ongoing
FBI investigations; and information originating with other
agencies, including foreign intelligence agencies. Mr. Moore
Ext. Affairs was advised that if he desired an FBI representative to be
available for consultation at the time and place of the
interview, one would be supplied. Mr. Moore commented that

RE: INTERVIEW OF FORMER FBI SA BY Ssc
Statement of John M. Matter
STATEMENT OF JOHN M. MATTER
The following information is supplied as a result
of an interview of former SA John M. Matter by SSC Staff
Members Michael Epstein (asked about 95% of the questions)
and Ms. Mary DeOreo (asked about 5% of the questions).
The information is presented according to subject matter and
not in the chronological order in which it was asked because
Epstein kept going back and picking up points that had been
discussed previously.
The interview began at 11:35 a.m. on Friday
July 25, 1975, and lasted until 5:40 p.m. with an hour out
for lunch and three 10 minute breaks. It was held in a
small, acoustically-treated room (former projection booth)
up one flight of stairs above room G-308, Dirksen Senate
Office Building. Epstein advised that this was an interview
concerning the part I had in the Bureau investigation of
Martin Luther King, Jr. (hereinafter MIK). He did not advise
me of my rights until I called his attention to the lack of
this about 5:00 p.m., at which time he told me all information
I gave was to be supplied voluntarily, that anything I said
could be the subject of further investigation by his Staff
and that I could decline to answer any questions which I
did not feel were within the scope of the inquiry.
:
Epstein asked if I had discussed the MLK matter
with any Bureau personnel this morning (July 25, 1975) - he say
me come to G-308 with the FBI representative who was available
for consultation), and I stated I had discussed procedural
matters with SAs Paul Daly and Seymor Phillips, both of whom
had leaned ever backwards to limit my discussion to procedural
matters and nothing else.
Epstein asked for and I supplied background
information as to my present address, when I entered on duty
in the Bureau, the field offices (FOS) where I had worked,

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)
RB; INTERVIEW OF FORMEN FBI SA BY SSC
Statement of John M. Matter
when I was first assigned to the Radio Engineering Section
(hereinafter Re SNC), and how long I was in that Section.
He asked how I would describe my particular kind of work and
I told him "security work" in the Security Unit in which I
ultimately became Unit Chief. He inquired if I was assigned
to other than the Re SEC and I advised that when I first
reported on duty in the Laboratory in 1944, it was the
Electrical Section, but that about two or three years later
that Section was merged with the Re SEC. He asked and was
told that the Chief of the Re SEC at the time was I. W. Conrad,
who later became Assistant Director of the Laboratory.
After about 10 minutes, Epstein started to question
me as to what Units existed in the Re SEC, what type of work
was done in the Units and who was working with me in my Unit
explaining that he was trying to get an idea of how the Re SEC
vas set up and where an investigation of MLK-type would fit
into that Section. I asked for and was granted permission to
see the FBI consultation reprezentative who accompanied ma.
When advised by me of this line of questioning, the
representative told me to supply such information as to the
Me SEC's set-up and the name of any Agents in my Unit. On
returning to the interview, Epstein then produced an FBI
organizational chart from the position of Director on down
through the individual units in the sections under each
division (this chart appeared to be one issued after my
retirement in May, 1971). He called my attention to the
Be SEC and the Units listed thereunder, all of which dealt
with radio matters except one which was listed as "Evidence
Examinations." I advised him that my work fell into the latter
and that all other units listed had to do with some phase of
radio communications used throughout the Bureau. I furnished
him at his request the following names of persons who had
worked with me in "security matters" during 1960 to 1968,
which he named as the period in which he was interested:

MATTER BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS
Set out below is information concerning an
interview of former FBI SA John M. Matter by SSC Starr
Members. Matter served in the FBI from October 21, 1940,
until his retirement May 28, 1971. He is a current
resident of Ft. Myers, Florida.
On advance notice from Mr. Michael Epstein,
SSC Staff Member, Matter traveled to Washington, D. C.,
from his residence in Florida to be interviewed at
11:30 a.m. July 25, 1975, in the SSC offices.
Prior to appearing for the interview, Matter
was informed by the FBI that he was being released from
any applicable employment agreement for the purpose of
the SSC interview which Epstein had indicated would concern
the former FBI investigation of Martin Luther King, Jr.
It was explained to Matter by the FBI that he had the
right to counsel; however, the FBI was unable to provide
private counsel. Matter was also told that there were
certain privileged areas concerning which he would not
be required to answer questions. These areas concerned
sources; information relating to sensitive methods and
techniques; information which might adversely affect

"Lish Whitson." I replied that I did not know a Ryan, and
that Phillips, Fred (not Frank). Baumgardner and Lish Whitson
were possibilities but I could not specifically recall whether
it was any one of them. Epstein hammered on "who was the
case supervisor," but I could give him nothing more definite
than I had indicated.
.
It took me somewhere between one and two weeks to
complete my part of the assignment. There were inquiries
from both my Section Chief and the DID as to progress. There
were long hours put in by both Campbell and myself to do an
accurate and reliable job as well as possible. No one else

from the FO tapes, but most likely such was done since this
would eliminate the possibility of damaging the FO tapes during
transcription. At the same time I would have been able to
monitor the FO tapes to gain familiarity with the subject
matter and any sections which I might use for the composite
or were unintelligible. It is possible that Campbell may have
monitored the tapes with me at the same time with a second
set of earphones, but I could not specifically, recall such.
I made the composite by copying the pertinent sections from the
FO tapes onto a single reel. The first part of the composite
would contain all the excerpts from one FO; the second part of
the composite, the excerpts from another FO; and so on through
the third and fourth parts. There possibly were gaps within.

and William D. Campbell. I stated that there may have been
others whose names I could not recall or who did not fit
into the time period he mentioned. He asked and I advised
that during that period, Richard L. Millen was Section Chief
and Arthur J. Baker was his Number One Man.
Epstein and Dereo specifically named the following
persons and asked if they were connected in any way with the
MLK investigation: Pfafman, Mayo, Swartz, Bradley, Stevens,
and Berley. I advised that Robert F. Pfafman and George W.
Mayo had retired from the Re SEC about 1956 and 1958
respectively, Richard Swartz about 1968, Wayne Bradley about
1974, Wilbur G. Stevens was still in the Section, and
succeeded me as Unit Chief, that George Berley was in another
Section of the FBI Laboratory, and that to my personal
knowledge none of the above had been connected with the MEK
investigation. Epstein specifically asked whether "Don
Parsons" would have been involved and I told him I had no
knowledge of such. He asked if I knew Parsons and I said.
yes, he had been a former Assistant Director of the FBI
Laboratory.
Epstein and DeCreo questioned me at great length
as to how I got my assignment in the MLK investigation, who
authorized the investigation, how long my work took, how
"the tapes" came into my possession, how I used "the tapës"
during my work, what I did with "the tapes" after I was
finished with my assignment, and whether anyone else worked
with me on the assignment (specifically asking me if I knew
"a William Campbell"). They also inquired what case supervisor
I dealt with in the Domestic Intelligence Division (hereinafter
DID). Some of these points were gone over by the
interrogators two or three times. I advised largely as follows
and qualified many of my answers as being "to the best of my
memory," and in some instances I could not recall specific
details or names!

or a plain box. I estimate the total elapsed playing time of the
composite as being somewhere between 45 and 90 minutes, but
I could not recall the specific time nor the tape speed.
Epstein made quite a point of asking if the composite
had actually been put together as explained above, or whether
one or more
it was put together in the following manner:
excerpts from one FO tape immediately followed by one or more
excerpts from another FO tape, and followed again by one or
more excerpts from a third or fourth FO tape. It appeared that

manner and I categorically denied that any effort had been
made on my part to have the composite convey an idea other

was finished I made two or three copies of it which I identified
as "third generation tapes," while I considered the composite
"second generation tape." I delivered the composite, most
a
likely in the government routing envelope, to William C.
Sullivan in the JB, fifth floor office of then Assistant to
the Director Alan Belmont. I recalled that this was on a
Saturday and Belmont was in his office with Sullivan.
Delivery was made to Sullivan as a result of instructions I.
had most likely obtained from Millen or Conrad who also told
me to inquire of Sullivan if there was anything else he wanted
me to do. I so inquired and Sullivan replied that there was
nothing further and that he would take it from there. I
could not recall if I delivered two or three copies of the
composite to Sullivan at the same time or whether they were
sent to him or the DID case supervisor by special messenger

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)
RE: INTERVIEW OF FORMER FBI SA BY SSC
Statement of John M. Matter
My assignment came orally from Section Chief Millen
and quite possibly Assistant Director Conrad in a conference
of the three of us in which I was advised that a Top Secret
investigation of MLK had been authorized by the then
Attorney General (AG) Robert F. Kennedy to determine if any
attempt was being made by the Communist Party (CP) to
infiltrate UK's organization and use it to serve the Party's
purposes. This particularly related to at least one high
placed MIK staff member (whose name I do not recollect) who
had been associated with CF activities in the past.
I was
told that I was to render all technical assistance that was
required in keeping with any requests made by then PID
Assistant Director, William C. Sullivan, or DID case superviser
handling the investigation. Some tapes from the AU-authorized
MLK installations would be received by me, and I was to prepare
a composite tape of any. derogatory information in those tapes.
William Campbell of the Washington Field Office (WFO) was to
work with me and was to be primarily responsible for preparing
a transcript of the WFO tapes, while pinpointing for me any
information that might be of value for the composite.
Campbell came to the Re SEC with the WFO tapes and he
and I set up the necessary transcription and filtaring
equipment for him in the studio and control room parts of
Room 7318 in the Justice Building (JB). At some point
additional tapes were received from authorized MLK installations

recall whether any of the tapes were received directly
by the Re SEC, from the last three FOs, but was of the
opinion that they were most likely received from the DID case
supervisor whose name I could not specifically recall.
I was asked specifically if that case supervisor's name

gave a composite copy to Campbell so that he could make a
transcription of it. However, that was a possibility because
Campbell had the job of transcribing the WFO tapes and worked
at it up to 6 weeks or two months.
To the best of my recollection, Campbell retained the
WFO tapes and I have no way of knowing whether I used all
WFO tapes or only those Campbell selected as being pertinent.

I do not recall the specifics, but the tapes from
were returned to the

the investigation or after Campbell completed his work. About
two years after that, I got a telephone call from the DID case
supervisor inquiring as to whether the Re SEC still had the
tapes. I verified that he was the case supervisor and assured
him the
tapes had been
sent to the DID after the Laboratory's work had been completed.

I have no specific knowledge as to what was to be
done with the composite or the copies thereof. The preparation
in the sterile form of tape, reel and box was apparently done
as a result of a specific request made by William C. Sullivan.

RE: INTERVIEW OF FORMER FBI SA BY SSC
Statement of John M. Matter
I have no knowledge that a physical and/or photographic
surveillance of MLK was conducted by the Bureau.
I received no "letter of commendation" or
"meritorious raise" as a result of my work on the MLK ease.
Nor was the latter specifically or otherwise mentioned in my last
efficiency report. Epstein was very specific in asking about
the letter of commendation, the meritorious raise and the
efficiency report.
He asked if I was aware in any way that the tape had
been furnished newsmen. I told him that I had a recollection
of reading an article in a newspaper or weekly news magazine
a few months or a year or more after my assignment that MLK
tape information had been obtained by or furnished to newsmen.
I wondered at the time how they had been able to get the
information. I also pointed out that within the last year or
two there have been a number of references by several featured
news columnists that MLK tape information had been leaked to
selected columnists. I again denied that at the time
I delivered the composite to Sullivan that I had any specific
knowledge of the use to which it was to be put.
Epstein and DeOreo did not ask if I had any further
information to furnish to them which had not been brought out
by questioning. It was very apparent that they did not wish to
pursue the subject matter in a composite tape any further after
I stated that

Epstein gave me no explanation as to where he

obtained the names that he specifically mentioned to me. It
appeared to be his desire to conduct a thorough interview and
to clear up confusion In his mind, possibly caused by conflicting
reports about the tapes. He and DeOreo were courteous and
stayed well within the legitimate bounds of the MLK investigation
except as possibly indicated by his questions concerning the
makeup of the Re SEC and its Units. While he did not state it
specifically, as such, it appeared to me that he was trying to
determine how tape recordings resulting from microphone
surveillances were handled in a Section which dealt with radio
matters. He seemed satisfied when I told him that the work of
my Unit came under the "Evidence Examinations" Unit. He also
accepted my explanation of "security work" with the comment that
such sensitive work certainly was of a security nature.
made no effort whatsoever to inquire as to what further work
I may have done in the Section. He specifically asked whether
I had given any MLK information to Stevens, and I replied that
while I could not recall specifically, this was possible because
Stevens and I worked closely together and he would have had to
take over the case in my absence..
:
At a point near the end of the interview, Epstein
asked me if I am a personal friend of William Sullivan,
Seymor Phillips, Fred Baumgardner and Lish Whitson. I replied,
"No." Epstein indicated doubt, to which I added that my
relations with all were purely official. Epstein then asked if
I held any animosity toward Sullivan. I answered, "No." He then
inquired, "You don't have any?" Again I replied "No."

:
I supposed.
that Bureau officials had their own reason for requesting
such a composite, but I was never told.
Epstein kept pressing me with "didn't you think
this was strange?" and finally "what was your opinion?" To
the former I replied "not necessarily," and to the latter I
said a possible reason could have been that Bureau officials
wanted to give the composite to AG Robert F. Kennedy to show
him the type of information being obtained so that he could
decide whether the surveillances he had authorized were to be
continued. I never discussed the "MLK tapes" with anyone
in the Crime Records Division. I don't rule out the possibility
that some member of that Division may have asked whether I had
worked on the tapes, but I certainly had no discussion on the
subject matter. I did not discuss the tapes with "Deke". DeLoach
(specifically named by Epstein after he had asked me whether I
had discussed the tapes with anyone in the Crime Records
Division). Epstein asked if I had any knowledge of Ernie Belter
having anything to do with the MLK installation - WFO, and I
told him, "none.
He appeared to be trying to find some sort of record
within the Bureau so that he could get names, dates and
assignments. In answer to his inquiry, I stated that it was
quite likely I had received an "assignment slip" to account for
my time in the case. I seriously doubted that such a slip
would bear the name of MLK but would most likely have identified
it as a "special case" or the "MLK case." I had no knowledge
of how Campbell's assignment was handled. A register is kept in
the Re SEC for personnel signing in and out, but this would only
show dates and times worked by me and other personnel, and
would not indicate what I was doing during a particular day
or 'period of time period." Campbell, being assigned to WFO, would
have signed in and out on the WFO register, even though he was
working for a longer period of time in the Re SEC space.

As indicated in the enclosure to the Committee's
July 9, 1975 letter to the Attorney General, we are still
awaiting several requested items which relate to the relation-
ship between the FBI and the CIA.
Although an FBI file search is presumably under-
way to locate all items which would be responsive to that
section of the Committee's request; we would appreciate
receiving as soon as possible, as a partial response, all
of the items bearing on this subject which were specifically
identified in the attachment to the Committee's May 14, 1975
request, as well as the exchange of correspondence between
'the FBI and the CIA which occurred on March 11 and 20, 1970,
and which related to domestic intelligence collection. ✗
1111
Finally, we would appreciate your advice concern-
ing the nature of DC_CHECKCOCKAPPER" and Operation ORKID which are
identified in the above-referenced March 20, 1970 letter
from Director Helms to Director Hoover.

Interview of Donald E. Moore by
Mr. Loch Johnson, Senate Select Committee
July 28, 1975
°
Mr. Johnson stated at the outset that this was an informal
interview and he did not place me under oath. He asked about my
background which was provided him and included the fact that I
served in the FBI from March 10, 1941, until my retirement at
the end of June 1973.
The interview concerned the so-called Huston Committee
and he asked if I knew Tom Charles Huston before the Committee
was established. I said I recalled meeting Huston once, in Bill
Sullivan's office, but I didn't recall when this was, but it was before
the Committee was formed. In response to questions, Mr. Johnson
was informed as follows:
I was aware of the meeting at the White House attended by
Director Hoover, Mr. Helms, Admiral Gayler and Gen. Bennett.
I was probably aware the meeting was to take place before the
meeting date but I can't recall this. (He said the meeting was
held June 5, 1970.) I was not at a meeting held in Mr. Hoover's
office June 8 but I recall hearing about the meeting, probably
from Bill Sullivan. I don't recall a meeting held in the Domestic
Intelligence Division after this at which Sullivan, Bill Cregar,
George Moore, Fred Cassidy and I were present. I did attend the
initial meeting of the Working Group headed by Sullivan and was
present because Sullivan asked me to be there. I remember Sullivan
and Cregar were at the meeting and I thought one or more other FBI
representatives were present. He mentioned George Moore and
Fred Cassidy were at the meeting.
I recall Mr. Helms and Mr. Angleton from.CIA were present
but did not recall the names of others including the representatives
from NSA, DIA and the military services. I recall Sullivan chaired
the meeting and that Huston sat at the opposite end of the table.
Either Helms or Sullivan announced that Helms probably couldn't
stay for the entire meeting but I don't recall Helms leaving, although
he did not sit directly at the conference table.

in the DAG's office 7/21/15 D.L.A.
Ja
Thank you for your letter replying to our letter concerning
access by certain members of the Select Committee to files and
documents concerning them held by the Department, including the
FBI.
The Committee has resolved to adopt a slightly different
procedure than that proposed in your letter. As you know, the
purpose of this particular request is to enable the members,
through analysis of materials relating to them, to obtain general
insights into how the Department of Justice, including the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, collects, maintains and retrieves
for itself material on Americans generally. Accordingly, we
suggest that at a mutually convenient time, the designated members
come to the Department or the Bureau and physically go through
the retrieval process with the persons who would be responsible
for performing that function in a real life situation. The
Committee members do not wish to have their individual files
either removed from the filing system or "sanitized" prior to
their reviewing them.

This proposed method of on site review may help, moreover,
to alleviate the possible problems of disclosure to the particular
members which your letter adverted to. We are sure that you
could discuss any remaining actual problems with the members
themselves at your premises, including whatever retrieval problems
may exist with respect to the letters from the members themselves
which you referred to.
In the first instance, what the members seek is insight

I can't recall the conversation at the meeting but think that
Sullivan outlined the request of the President to study means of
getting better intelligence information on new left activities and
violent protest movements in the US, especially with regard to
possible foreign support. I think Sullivan probably outlined areas
of concern and asked representatives present to document where they
felt intelligence was lacking, how it could be obtained, who should
obtain it and what was needed to obtain it. I said I couldn't at this
date recall specific observations or proposals and rather believed
the purpose of the meeting was to outline the general problem and
ask the representatives to document these and come in with specific
recommendations at a subsequent meeting. I am certain Mr. Huston
spoke about the purpose of the meeting but I can't recall his comments.
This was the only meeting of the Working Group I attended.
I told Mr. Sullivan that if agreeable with him I would not attend
subsequent meetings and I thought the FBI had several representatives
present and that the thrust was on new left and related activities. As
I recall he said "suit yourself." Johnson pressed me on this and I
told him this was what I expressed to Sullivan but I also was somewhat
uneasy after the first meeting as I did not believe Mr. Hoover was
aware of collection efforts that were likely to be recommended. I
could not state what FBI members attended subsequent meetings but
I believe Charles Brennan and Bill Cregar, and of course, Bill
· Sullivan, attended as well as some other representatives.
I can't say who drafted the report but was sure it was under
Sullivan's direction. During the period of the meetings Deke DeLoach
had retired and Sullivan had been appointed Assistant to the Director
and moved from the 9th & D Building to the Justice Building. I
don't recall when Mr. Hoover's objections to certain of the
recommendations were added.. I can't say whether I saw the report
prior to the objections being in it but may have; I do recall seeing
the report after the objections were in it. I don't know whether
Mr. Hoover told Sullivan to put the objections in it but presume
Sullivan knew Mr. Hoover's views and put the objections in on this
basis. I could not answer the question as to whether Mr. Tolson
was the person responsible for having the objections made but felt
he would have objected to the initial recommendations.

„HEREIN IS PICT
DASE 10/10 100 -SP-2 ALM 1776
The legal authority of the FBI to use confidential
informants as an investigative technique rests upon three factors:
1) Legislative authority embodied in the approval
of the annual appropriation.
2) Case law that the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth
Amendments do not protect a wrongdoer from
the use of informants.
3) Case law reflecting that courts recognize the
necessity and utility of informants in providing
probable cause for making arrests without a
warrant, and for obtaining warrants, provided
that certain conditions are met.
Regarding the first of the above-cited factors,
reference is made to the "Hearings Before a Subcommittee of the
Committee on Appropriations, House of Representatives, Departments
of State, Justice and Commerce, the Judiciary and Related Agencies
Appropriations for 1974."
Part I, page 783 of those hearings, sets forth the-
justification language for the 1974 budget estimate for FBI salaries
and expenses. It is noted that this language is the same as used in
previous years except for underlined and bracketed changes which
do not affect this subject. There is specific provision under the

heading of "Salaries and Expenses" for "expenses necessary for the
detection and prosecution of crimes against the United States" and
more specifically for the "payment of rewards.
18
At page 879 of these hearings, there is set forth
as part of the testimony on "Investigative Accomplishments," a
paragraph detailing the statistics achieved by the use of confidential
informants. Since Congress has approved FBI appropriations without
objection to the use of money for "payment of rewards" or for the
informant achievements listed in the testimony, the approval of the
appropriations serves as one form of legislative approval for the
use of informants.
-
The use of informants does not violate the defendant's
rights under the Fourth Amendment. Hoffa v. United States, 385
U.S. 293 (1966).
7
"Neither this Court, nor any member of it has
ever expressed the view that the Fourth Amend-
ment protects a wrongdoer's misplaced belief
that a person to whom he voluntarily confides
his wrongdoing will not reveal it. Indeed, the
Court unanimously rejected that very contention
---in Lopez v. United States, 373 U.S. 427---"
Id. at 302
The Court also held that the use of an informer did
not violate Hoffa's rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments,
citing United States v. Dennis, 183 F.2d 201, 224, (1950), which
said,
1
NW 88326 Docld:32989627 Page 187
"Courts have countenanced the use of informers
from time immemorial; in cases of conspiracy,
or in other cases when the crime consists of
preparing for another crime it is usually necessary
to rely upon them or upon accomplices because
the criminals will almost certainly proceed
covertly."

Documents Pertaining To The

Re:
Re:
Further Documents Pertaining To
The FBI and Department of Justice
Also enclosed is a copy of SAC memorandum 23-75
dated May 27, 1975, which is believed responsive to 5.e. This
particular SAC memorandum is being provided herewith, since,
in view of its recent date, it was not included in the index
of SAC Letters and Memoranda previously made available to
the SSC Staff.
With regard to that portion of 5.e., above, concerning
"possible entrapment, provocation, interference with lawyer
client relationship or other problems," as it relates to
informant operation, there are no Bureau memoranda or other
material addressing these areas, as the same policy and
procedures applicable to Special Agent conduct regarding these
problems similarly apply to informants. In response to your
general request under 4.b., above, FBI policy and procedures
concerning such matters are set forth in the Manual of
Instructions (MOI) and the Manual of Rules and Regulations (MRR),
which have already been made available to SSC Staff Members
pursuant to an earlier request and to the SAC Letters and
Memoranda which are being made available to SSC Staff personnel
for review pursuant to another request.
With respect to your request under Item 4.a., above,
no memoranda or other materials were located relating to the
original decision to utilize informants in our investigations.
It is noted your requests under Item 5., Appendix A,
of referenced communication were directed by you to both the
FBI and the U. S. Department of Justice (DOJ). Our response
in this matter with respect to legal authority should therefore
be viewed in conjunction with any material you may have received
or will receive from the U. S. DOJ.

Memorandum.Donahue to Mr. Mintz
Re: LEGAL AUTHORITY OF THE FBI TO USE CONFIDENTIAL
INFORMANTS AS AN INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUE
•
Besides the explicit recognition reflected above of
the right of investigative bodies to avail themselves of informants,
there are other Supreme Court cases which implicitly recognize
this right by regulating the conditions under which an informant's
identity need be revealed at trial. (Roviaro v. United States,
353 U.S. 53 (1957)), or the conditions to be met in using an
informant's information as the basis of probable cause for an
arrest without a warrant. (Draper v. United States, 358 U.S. 307
(1959); McCray v. Illinois. 386 U.S. 300 (1967)). Similarly,
the Supreme Court has recognized that informant information may
form the basis for a warrant application, provided the affidavit
shows the underlying circumstances which would give reason to
believe the informant is credible, and circumstances showing
the basis for conclusions reached by the informant. (Aguilar v.
1 Texas, 378 U.S. 108 (1964)).
P
The above-cited cases show that while courts havo
circumscribed in several ways the uses to be made of informant
information, there has always been a recognition of the fact that
the informant is a basic and necessary weapon in law enforcement's
defense of society against crime.
RECOMMENDATION:
None; for information.

I did see the letter from the White House saying the report
had been approved. I believe it was signed by Huston and stated
the President had approved the recommendations. I was aware
Mr. Hoover had either written or seen Attorney General Mitchell
expressing his reluctance and was aware the White House letter was
withdrawn. I din't know why it was withdrawn other than this
occurred after Mr. Hoover went to the Attorney General.
Mr. Johnson asked certain specific questions during or
after the above discussion. He asked what covert mail coverage
was involved since CIA in 1970 was engaged in covert mail inter-
ception. After checking with Mr. Leon F. Schwartz of the FBI,
Mr. Johnson was advised that while I had been released from my
pledge of confidentiality by the FBI in general with regard to the
Huston Committee this matter was under review by the Department
of Justice and I had not been released from my pledge on this
aspect. A similar answer was given to the question about what
was meant by the removal of restrictions on the use of surreptitious
entry of embassies to obiain cryptographic materials.
Mr. Johnson asked if I thought the Huston Committee had
been instigated by Bill Sullivan to more or less force Mr. Hoover
to take a more aggressive stance in intelligence collection. I
answered that I would not like to speculate on this and I could not
make a definite statement yes or no.
He asked why the Working Group met at CIA as opposed to
the FBI and whether this had special meaning. I answered that I
did not think so, that the US Intelligence Board was headed by the
Director of CIA, was concerned with intelligence collection and
met at CIA and also meeting arrangements could probably be better
arranged at CIA in view of parking, conference rooms, etc.
He said Admiral Gayler had stated that he and his predecessor,
Gen. Carter, had tried to get Mr. Hoover to provide more support to
NSA with regard to Communications Intelligence and asked if I was
aware of any such efforts, and if they were in person or in writing.
I said I was aware that Gen. Carter and Adm. Gayler had asked for
support and I believe they might have seen Mr. Hoover personally
and perhaps had written him.

MEMORANDUM TO ALL SPECIAL AGENTS IN CHARGE:
(A) INFORMANT MATTERS - DEFENSE PLANS AND STRATEGY --
Recently there have been several instances where attorneys in connection
with law suits have publicly and erroneously alleged that the FBI utilized
informants to uncover defense plans and strategy. Also, recently a former
informant falsely alleged that informant's services were utilized by the
Bureau to infiltrate a defense camp. These accusations reemphasize the
need for the careful and professional handling of informants at all times.
As you are aware under current policy, informants are advised
to avoid becoming involved in defense plans or strategy in subversive-type
cases or with anyone under criminal indictment. It is the responsibility
of all Special Agents handling informants to insure that their informants
are continually alert so that they will avoid becoming involved in defense
matters and in the event an informant is requested to assist or partake in
such matters, that the contacting Agent is immediately advised so that the
matter will be recorded. If the informant cannot avoid being involved,
informant is not to report any information pertaining to defense plans or
strategy and such incident must be promptly reported to the Bureau under
the substantive case caption.
In view of the above, the statement of cooperation normally
signed by security and extremist informants is being amended to incorporate
current policy regarding defense plans and strategy. Where it is not required
as in criminal informant cases or it has not been practical to obtain a state- ·
ment of cooperation, each handling Agent must orally advise the informant
of the above, reduce it to writing, and record it in the informant's file. Insure
that all pending informant files reflect the above as a matter of record.

NOTE:
"DRD
It is noted that the original request from the
Committee, specifically to furnish all memoranda pertaining to
the "conduct" of the FBI investigation in the Dominican Republic
in 1965 is rather ambiguous and nonspecific and efforts to
clarify this request have not met with much success to date.
It is believed the memorandum prepared is responsive to their
request; however, if they desire additional information at
some future date same will be considered.

Président Lyndon B. Johnson called and asked if I would check
as they want him to be the Chief of the Army
in the Dominican Republic, which would, in effect, control the city. The
President stated he did not know his first name.. I asked if he was in the.
Dominican Republic at the present time. The President stated he was; that
they were getting pretty close to a settlement with

had checked him out, but anyway I had the whole list and he wants to be sure
they are checked and that there are none who are known communists because,
that is one thing both the right and left wings would attack him one, so the on!
way to protect him, the President, is to be sure they are not communists.
The President stated another thing is how are they going to get rid of the
communists when we do get a government. I stated that is going to acpend
on the strength of the one in power.
I told the President that in connection with
going down to Puerto Rico with

government in the alternatives are: Let them fight it out and kill thousands
and probably the communists would end up in charge; we can go in there and
try to get them to agree and go on the constitution and let them vote on it in
60 or 90 days, expervise the election and have a cabinet we mutually agreed
upon which I can check upon; then once we got it, help the President with
some intelligence people to point up who are communists. He said they ought
to be Latins or ones who speak the language and he wanted me to take charge
of that and to start right now saying if I were President, what I would do down
there to get rid of the communists. The President stated it can't be done in
one day, but that is what he wants for the Dominican Republic.
I told the President I had quite a number of Agents, a hundred or so,
who are expert in the Spanish language so we have the facilities that we can do
that. The President asked that I look at the best ones and see who it is; that
it has to be a fellow who can get along with the new President whom he can
trust, to figure out what I need, how I would set it up, and what I would do
to get set up to go to work on the communists. I stated I thought it can be
covered as we do in the South American countries as we have in some foreign
countries a Legal Attache attached to the Embassy and if we have a man
from the Bureau attached to the Embassy as Legal Attache, he can be the
medium through which to advise the President and select the individuals
who ought to be listed, deported, or put under control. The President asked
I get the results of the check to him as soon as possible on
2:56 PM
While talking to the Attorney General on another matter, I advised
him the President had just called and wanted a name checked, but also wanted
me to pick a squad of FBI Agents to go to the Dominican Republic when the
now government is formed to advise the President on the removal of communists
and getting them out of government offices. I briefed the Attorney General on
my conversation with the President. I told him I was not enthusiastic about it,
but since he wants it done, I was starting to look into it and trying to line up
fifteen or twenty men able to do it. I told the Attorney General I had wanted
him to know in the event the President speaks to him about it.

SUBJECT:
LEGAL ATTACHE'S OFFICE,
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC.
#m DR16
ALL INFORMATION
HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED
DATE 11-15-00 DYSP-2 ALM 12963
The Director advised that the President will want the FBI to
set up a group in the Dominican Republic to advise the President of
the Dominican Republic concerning Communists, how to deal with them,
and how to get rid of them. It is contemplated that we will set up
a Legal Attache's Office, with a group of 20 to 25 men, for the purpose
of taking charge of cleaning out communists in the Dominican Govern-
ment and advising the government of those who may try to infiltrate
into the government. This activity would take place first in the
city of Santo Domingo, and then extend throughout the country until
all communists have been spotted and the Dominican Government has been
advised.
All of the agents to be sent down should be fluent in Spanish
and we should select any who have Dominican or Spanish blood, which
will assist them in working inconspicuously with the populace.
Relative to the Legal Attache, he should be a top man, fully
experienced, as he will be dealing with the President of the Dominican
Republic and with our Ambassador there.
ACTION:
In anticipation of the above, the Director desires that we
draw up suggestions for a Legal Attache and for a group of twenty to
twenty-five men who can proceed, when so ordered, to the Dominican
Republic for this purpose.

A copy of this memorandum is being designated for the

Any leads for purpose of checking background of potential sources
for Santo Domingo must receive priority attention and results submitted by
teletype.
In addition to the Dominican requirements placed upon the Bureau,
your attention is directed to over-all need for additional informants and
sources in the Latin-American field. The reputation the Bureau has gained
during recent Dominican crisis is due in large part to the results achieved
in developing Dominican sources through a concentrated informant develop-
ment program over the past several years.
In view of critical state of unrest in Latin America today, each
office should survey its informant coverage in this field. If substantial
numbers of nationals of any Latin-American country reside within the
territory covered by your office, Bureau expects that you will have coverage
sufficient to alert you to exile organizational activities of political nature,
plots to overthrow existing governments, and general intelligence data
concerning the countries of interest. Informant development in this field
is considered most important and any weaknesses which now exist must be
overcome promptly by instituting an aggressive informant development
program.
Very truly yours,
John Edgar Hoover

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION
June 2, 1965
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20535
(A) DOMINICAN SITUATION (NATIONALITY GROUP COVERAGE - LATIN
AMERICA)-- For your information, Bureau has established a Legal Attache
in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, who has already begun to make a
valuable contribution to the over-all efforts of the United States in making
certain that the Dominican Republic does not become another Cuba. If the
United States succeeds in its efforts to keep communists out of the new
Dominican coalition government which is in the process of being formed,
current United States policy in the Dominican Republic could very well
become the established course of action for all other countries in Latin
America threatened with communism.
The responsibilities which have been placed upon the Bureau
in developing intelligence data in the Dominican Republic, as well as in
other Latin-American countries, are not only tremendous but may be the
heaviest and most far-reaching burden the FBI has ever been asked to
assume in the intelligence field. To guarantee our complete success,
teamwork is a must.
Accordingly, first we must do everything possible to assist
Legal Attache, Santo Domingo, in his immediate task of developing
quality sources of sufficient quantity to effect maximum coverage in the
Dominican Republic.
In this regard, each office and Legal Attache must furnish
to the Bureau within five days of the receipt of this letter under the caption
of "DOMSIT" (code word for "Dominican Situation") the following:
(1) Identities of any established sources (former or current)
who are now in the Dominican Republic.
(2) Persons in Dominican Republic known to personnel of
your office who appear to have good source potential.
(3) Identities of any current security sources (regardless of
nationality) who may be available for assignment (temporary or permanent)
in the Dominican Republic if such is considered feasible by Legal Attache,
Santo Domingo.
This document is prepared in response to your request and is not for dissemi-
nation outside your Committee. Its use is limited to official proceedings by
your Committee and the content may not be disclosed to unauthorized person-
nel without the express approval of the FBI .

August 24, 1905
I stated that I think we are going to have trouble down there
but I think CIA can handle it with their force. He replied that they will
be delighted to have us stay but they certainly appreciate the fact we
may need our people elsewhere. I said we need them in this country
where the riots are occurring; that this is not really our field; that it
is CIA's field; and that the sooner we get back to our own field, the
better.
I again stated it is very likely the President may speak to
Admiral Raborn about this and he thanked me for calling. ·

I called Admiral William F. Raborn, Director of CIA, and
told him I wanted to pass on to him a development he may be asked about.
I stated, about ten days ago, the President asked my view of the removal:
of my men from the Dominican Republic and whether the work we have
been doing down there could be carried on by CLA as effectively as both
agencies have handled it in the past.
I stated I checked with who is in charge of the FBI's
office in the Dominican Republic, and he felt very strongly the FBI men
could be withdrawn and the CIA personnel carry on. I advised Admiral
Reborn that I sent this message to the White House and got word from
Marvin Watson that the President indicated no move snouid be made at
this time and that our men are still down there.
I advised Admiral Raborn that I expect to see the President
this week and I am going to bring this up to see whether he will make a
decision; that we could use those men back here; and that I think the
situation is well in hand by CIA personnel. I said I thought the President.

Memorandum for Messrs. Tolson, Belmont, DeLoach, Sullivan
The President stated that while he thinks Admiral kaborn is a
wonderful man, this is playing for koeps and we can't have a Communist
Government and we have to have somebody alert enough to stand up and say
"this is suspicious," ct cetera. The Fresident stated they tell him they have
an Attorney General who is quite suspicious. I stated he is very dangerous
to have in the Attorney General position. I stated in the discussion we had the
other day in Mir. Bundy's office, one matter was how the investigative set-up
would be under the new government and they were going to have a rising squadron
of men working airectly for the President of the Dominican Repustic and then
an intelligence unit which would gather information and a Dominican national
police. I stated I expressed my opinion that I thought it was wrong for the
President to have a ilying squadron which would be nothing more or less than
a secret police like Trujillo bad who would make just reports the President
would want against certain individuals who might not be as bad as the President
felt they were. I stated I felt there should be an intelligence unit and that the
national police should be increased. I stated we, of course, would assist in
any training program they might want to set up either down there or up here..
I stated at the present time in the national police is one man who was trained
in our National Academy and was very valuable in fui misning us with information
that we could not have gotten from other sources.
The President asked if we were having any trouble working together
and I told him no trouble at all. The President stated he had asked me to pe
on the job to keep the communists from taking over this hemisphere and to
serve him and he thought we ought to wait and not pull out of the Dominican
Republic until the government has been selected and we get along further in
this; for me to tell my man down there to root out everything he can and to pe.
hard and tough as he can and be sure we get rid of every spy; that he did not know
what the diplomatic people are doing to see that President Godoy takes our
reports and respects them. I stated I understand the Attorney General was

OPERATIONS
Re:
LEGAL ATTACHE, SANTO DOMINGO OFFICE
In the case of
f.
this informant was originally
developed by the New York Office. Legal Attache suggested
the New York Office might have use of informant's services.
: This information furnished to New York Office which replied
that in the absense of organized activity informant would be
of no use unless he came to New York with instructions from
Dominican communist groups to reorganize activity. This,
of course, is not a desirable situation.
OBSERVATIONS:
➤
We believe Legal Attache, Santo Domingo's recommendation
to turn
over to CIA is sound, even though
both of these sources are in a position to furnish valuable
intelligence information to us. By making these informants
available to the Agency we will avoid any possible duplication
or conflict. This matter should be discussed with appropriate
officials by our Liaison Agent in order to insure the Agency
is fully aware of our current status in the Dominican Republic.
ACTION:
If you approve:
(1) Liaison Agent will advise appropriate CIA
officials as follows:
•
In accordance with the desire of the President that
the FBI remain in the Dominican Republic, we are setting up a
regular Legal Attache Office in Santo Domingo.consisting of
three men. This will not be an operational office but rather
will serve as a strategic listening post for intelligence data
and as liaison with agencies of the Dominican Republic, as
well as other agencies of foreign governments in that country.
In connection with this reorganization, we have instructed our
representative in Santo Domingo to make informants avail-
able to the Agency in the event it may wish to operate them.
(2) The attached teletype, with instructions to
make
available to CIA, will be sent to the
Legal Attache, Santo Domingo.

President Lyndon B. Johnson called. He stated he was worried about
the situation in the Dominican Republic and asked me how I felt about it. I
told him it was my feeling that it is in an awful mess; that there have been several
people who have been selected to be in the Cabinet who are far from being free
of communist association or domination and why they were selected, I did not know,
but I thought the situation down there is very critical. I stated I met with
McGeorgo Bundy and Admiral William Kaborn of the Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA) the other day as to whether the FBI could withdraw from the Dominican
Republic and my view was that we could as CLA is thoroughly qualified and has
a good man down there to carry on the responsibilities and there is no need for
the FBI to remain. I stated it was the view of Admiral Raborn and myself that
it was going to be a mess and that we would have trouble for some time to come
because various people are going back to the Dominican ft. public now, such as
and his followers, and the former Presidents who were deposed and

there are going to be violent outbursts which are characteristic of the Latins.

opposition.
The President stated he was not too happy with CIA and the reports
he gets from them and he would hate to see the Bureau people pull out until a
government is formed. I stated we wouldn't until he, the President, says so;
that as I said the other day, we would not leave until the decision has been made
by the President.

This is to recommend that the Central Intelligence

desire that the FBI remain in the Dominican Republic and that
Legal Attache, Santo Domingo, be authorized to turn ☑

Dom
The Director advised that the President will want the FBI to
set up a group in the Dominican Republic to advise the President of
the Dominican Republic concerning Communists, how to deal with them,
and how to get rid of them. It is contemplated that we will set up
a Legal Attache's Office, with a group of 20 to 25 men, for the purpose
of taking charge of cleaning out communists in the Dominican Govern-
ment and advising the government of those who may try to infiltrate
into the government. This activity would take place first in the
city of Santo Domingo, and then extend throughout the country until
all communists have been spotted and the Dominican Government has been
advised.
All of the agents to be sent down should be fluent in Spanish
and we should select any who have Dominican or Spanish blood, which
will assist them in working inconspicuously with the populace.
Relative to the Legal Attache, he should be a top man, fully
experienced, as he will be dealing with the President of the Dominican
Republic and with our Ambassador there.
ACTION:
In anticipation of the above, the Director desires that we
draw up suggestions for a Legal Attache and for a group of twenty to
twenty-five men who can proceed, when so ordered, to the Dominican
Republic for this purpose.
A copy of this memorandum is being designated for the
Administrative Division so that the Domestic Intelligence Division ·
and the Administrative Division can work together on this. Time
is of the essence.

government in the alternatives are: Let them fight it out and kill thousands
and probably the communists would end up in enarge; we can go in there and
try to get them to agree and go on the constitution and ict the vote on it in
00 or 20 ways, supervise the election and have a cabinet we mutually agreed
upon which I can check upon; then once we got it, holp the President with
conic intelligence people to point up who are communists. He said they ought
to be Latins or ones who speak the language and he wanted me to tako charge
oi that and to start right now saying if i were President, what I would do down
there to get rid of the communists. The President stated it can't be done in
one day, but that is what he wants for the Dominican Republic.
I told the President I had quite a number of Agents, a hundred or so,
who are expert in the Spanish language so we have the facilities that we can do
that. The President asked that I look at the best ones and see who it ia; that
it has to be a fellow who can get along with the new President whom he can
trust, to figure out what I need, how I would set it up, and what I would do
to get set up to go to work on the communists. I stated I thought it can be
covered as we do in the South American countries as we have in some foreign
countries & Legal Attache attached to the Lmbassy and if we have 2 man
from the buivau attached to the Dribassy of Legal Attraho, he can be the
medium through which to advice the President and select the individuals
who ought to be listed, deported, or put under control. The President asked
I get the results of the check to him as soon as possible on Colonel-fora

him the President had just calied und wanted a name checked, but also wanted
me to pick a squad of FDI Agents to go to the Dominican Republic when the
new government te formed to advise the President on the removal of communists
and getting them out of government offices. I uricfed the Attorney General on
ly convertation with the President. I told him I was not enthusiastic about it,
but since he wants it done, I was starting to look into it and trying to line up
fifteen or twenty mien able to do it. I told the Attorney General I had wanted
his to know in the event the President speaks to him about it.

Any leads for purpose of checking background of potential sources
for Santo Domingo must receive priority attention and results submitted by
teletype.
In addition to the Dominican requirements placed upon the Bureau,
your attention is directed to over-all need for additional informants and
sources in the Latin-American field. The reputation the Bureau has gained
during recent Dominican crisis is due in large part to the results achieved
in developing Dominican sources through a concentrated informant develop-
ment program over the past several years.
In view of critical state of unrest in Latin America today, each
office should survey its informant coverage in this field. If substantial
numbers of nationals of any Latin-American country reside within the
territory covered by your office, Bureau expects that you will have coverage
sufficient to alert you to exile organizational activities of political nature,
plots to overthrow existing governments, and general intelligence data
concerning the countries of interest. Informant development in this field
is considered most important and any weaknesses which now exist must be
overcome promptly by instituting an aggressive informant development
program.

(A) DOMINICAN SITUATION (NATIONALITY GROUP COVERAGE LATIN
AMERICA)-- For your information, Bureau has established a Legal Attache
in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, who has already begun to make a
valuable contribution to the over-all efforts of the United States in making
certain that the Dominican Republic does not become another Cuba. If the
United States succeeds in its efforts to keep communists out of the new
Dominican coalition government which is in the process of being formed,
current United States policy in the Dominican Republic could very well
become the established course of action for all other countries in Latin
America threatened with communism.
The responsibilities which have been placed upon the Bureau
in developing intelligence data in the Dominican Republic, as well as in
other Latin-American countries, are not only tremendous but may be the
heaviest and most far-reaching burden the FBI has ever been asked to
assume in the intelligence field. To querentes our complete success,
teamwork is a must.
Accordingly, first we must do everything possible to assist
Legal Attache, Santo Domingo, in his immediate task of developing
quality sources of sufficient quantity to effect maximum coverage in the
Dominican Republic.
In this regard, each office and Legal Attache must furnish
to the Bureau within five days of the receipt of this letter under the caption
of "DOMSIT" (code word for "Dominican Situation") the following:
(1) Identities of any established sources (former or current)
who are now in the Dominican Republic.
(2) Persons in Dominican Republic known to personnel of
your office who appear to have good source potential.¨*:
(3) Identities of any current security sources (regardless of
nationality) who may be available for assignment (temporary or permanent)
in the Dominican Republic if such is considered feasible by Legal Attache,
Santo Domingo...

August 24, 1905
I stated that I think we are going to have trouble down there
but I think CIA can handle it with their force. He replied that they will
be delighted to have us stay but they certainly appreciate the fact we
may need our people elsewhere. I said we need them in this country
where the riots are occurring; that this is not really our field; that it
is CIA's field; and that the sooner we get back to our own field, the
better.
I again stated it is very likely the President may speak to
Admiral Rabora about this and he thanked me for calling.

I called Admiral William F. Raborn, Director of CIA, and
told him I wanted to pass on to him a development he may be asked about.
I stated, about ten days ago, the President asked my view of the removal
of my men from the Dominican Republic and whether the work we have
been doing down there could be carried on by CIA as effectively as both
agencies have handled it in the past.
-
I stated I checked with Anderson who is in charge of the FBI's
office in the Dominican Republic, and he felt very strongly the FBI men
could be withdrawn and the CIA personnel carry on. I advised Admiral
Raborn that I sent this message to the White House and got word from
Marvin Watson that the President indicated no move should be made at
this time and that our men are still down there.
I advised Admiral Raborn that I expect to see the President
this week and I am going to bring this up to see whether he will make a
decision; that we could use those men back here; and that I think the
Bituation is well in hand by CIA personnel. I said I thought the President
might make some inquiry of Admiral Raborn.
Admiral Raborn said he certainly appreciated my calling and
he is delighted with the fine way our folks have gotten along; that there is
a lot of mutual respect. I stated that I instructed Anderson to let me
know what his views were and did not tell him mine; that he was very high...
in praise of the man in charge of the CIA office, as well as the staff of
this office. Admiral Raborn stated they welcome cooperation with the
FBI any and every place.

The Prezent stated we have to have an Ambassador who is a
practical fellow and one who understand his job. I stated he needed a good,
tough individual who will be able to stand up and dominate the President.
The President acted, "Who is ho?" nad told me to think about that and also
about what we are doing and not doing that should be done, as we can't lose
and he would be talking with me not week. I told him I would.

The President stated that while he thinks Admiral Kaborn is a
vonderful man, thus is playing for koeps and we can't have a Communist
Government and we have to have somebody alert enough to stand up and say
"this la suspicious," ct cetera. The Fresident stated they tell him they have
an Attorney General who is quite suspicious. I stated he is very dangerous
to have in the Attorney General position. I stated in the discussion we had the
other day in Mir. Bundy's office, one matter was how the investigative set-up
would be under the new government and they were going to have a flying squadron
of men working directly for the President of the Dominican Republic and then
an intelligence wut which would gather information and a Dominican national
police. I stated I expressed my coition that I thought it was wrong for the
President to have a flying squadron which would be nothing more or less than
& secret police like Trujillo bad who would make just reports the President
would want against certain individuals who might not be as bad as the President
felt they were. I stated I felt there should be an intelligence unit and that the
national police should be increased. I stated we, of course, would assist in
any training program they might want to set up either down there or up here..
I stated at the present time in the national police is one man who was trained
in our National Academy and was very valuable in furnishing us with information
that we could not have gotton from other sources.
**
The President asked if we were having any trouble working together
and I told him no trouble at all. The President stated he had asked me to be
on the job to keep the communists from taking over this hemisphere and to
serve him and he thought we ought to wait and not pull out of the Dominic
Republic until the government has been selected and we get along further in
this; for me to tell my man down there to root out everything he can and to bo...

Froid Lyndon B. Johnson called. He stated he was worried about

to him it was my fooling that it is in an awful mess; that there have been several

of communist association or domination and why they were selected, I did not know,
but ought the auction down there is very critical. I stated I met with

Republic and my view was that we could as CIA is thoroughly qualified and has
a good man d there to carry on the responsibilities and there is no need for
the UI to rain. I stated it was the view of Admiral Raborn and myself that
i was going to be a mess and that we would have trouble for some time to come
because various people are going back to the Dominican Republic now, such as
Otan Bosch and his followers, and the former Presidents who were deposed and

Memorandum W. R. Wannall to W. C. Sullivan
OPERATIONS
Re:
LEGAL ATTACHE, SANTO DOMINGO OFFICE
In the case of DOM-12, this informant was originally
developed by the New York Office. Legal Attache suggested
the New York Office might have use of informant's services.
This information furnished to New York Office which replied
that in the absense of organized activity informant would be
of no use unless he came to New York with instructions from
Dominican communist groups to reorganize activity. This,
of course, is not a desirable situation.
1.
OBSERVATIONS:
We believe Legal Attache, Santo Domingo's recommendation
to turn-DOM-10 and DOM-12 over to CIA is sound, even though
both of these sources are in a position to furnish valuable
intelligence information to us. By making these informants
available to the Agency we will avoid any possible duplication
or conflict. This matter should be discussed with appropriate
officials by our Liaison Agent in order to insure the Agency
is fully aware of our current status in the Dominican Republic.
ACTION:
If you approve:

In accordance with the desire of the President that

will serve as a strategic listening post for intelligence data
and as liaison with agencies of the Dominican Republic, as
well as other agencies of foreign governments in that country.
In connection with this reorganization, we have instructed our
representative in Santo Domingo to make two informants avail-

This is to recommend that the Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) be advised that we have set up a regular Legal
Attache Office in Santo Domingo in view of the President's
desire that the FBI remain in the Dominican Republic and that
Legal Attache, Santo Domingo, be authorized to turn two-
informants over to the Agency.
J
Va
In accordance with the desire of the President and
recommendation of the Honorable Marvin Watson, Special
Assistant to the President, that the FBI remain in the Dominican
Republic, the Director, on 8/2/66, advised the White House
that our staff in Santo Domingo would be reduced to three men
and that henceforth this office will be manned in a manner
similar to that of our other Legal Attache Offices. It will not
be an operational office but rather will serve as a strategic
listening post for intelligence data and as liaison with
agencies of the Dominican Republic, as well as other agencies
of foreign governments in that country.
In light of this redirection of effort, we instructed
Legal Attache, Santo Domingo, to review his informant coverage
to determine if any of our informants should be made availabi
to the Agency for operation. Legal Attache has recommended
that two informants, COM-10 and DOM-12 be turned over to CIA.
DOM-10 has been used principally to develop subversive data
on individuals in Santiago, Dominican Republic. DOM-12 is
a penetrative-type informant who has gained membership in
Dominican subversive groups: Both of these sources are
operational and are not the type we would contact in a normal
Maison capacity. Continuation of their services under our
current criteria would be a questionable procedure.

Dear Mr. Rimestad:
•
You have previously been advised of reductions
in FBI personnel overseas which were made in response to
the wishes of the President. In a further effort to
comply with the desire of the President, I have decided
to reduce our staff in Santo Domingo by one Special Agent
and one clerk. This will eliminate one position in GS-14
and one position in GS-8.
You may be sure that I will continue to give
this matter close scrutiny with a view to effecting further
economies whenever such action can be taken without impairing
the discharge of our responsibilities.

KENNEDY AIRPORT IN A ROOM AT THE POSTAL AIR MAIL FACILITY.
CERTAIN CONSTANT CITIES WERE EXAMINED AND OTHER CITIES WERE
SELECTED ON A VARIABLE BASIS. WHEN LETTERS WERE OBSERVED THAT
WERE BELIEVED TO MEET THE CRITERIA THEY WERE BROUGHT BACK TO THE
NEW YORK OFFICE (NYO) WHERE THEY WERE OPENED AND PHOTOGRAPHED
BY THE AGENT CONDUCTING THE Z COVERAGE. THE VOLUME WAS VERY
SMALL, PROBABLY CONSISTING OF ABOUT TEN LETTERS IN A SIX MONTH
PERIOD. A DESCRIPTION OF THE MACHINE UTILIZED IN THE OPENING WAS
PROVIDED AND IT WAS EXPLAINED THAT WHEN A LETTER, BELIEVED
TO HAVE BEEN SENT BY A SOVIET AGENT WAS OBSERVED, PHOTO COPIES
WERE PROVIDED TO HEAD QUARTERS IN WASHINGTON, AS WELL AS,
AN
INVESTIGATIVE FILE BEING OPENED IN NEW YORK CITY (NYC). THE SIZE
OF THE SQUAD HANDLING THIS TOTAL OPERATION WAS ESTIMATED TO BE
ABOUT TWENTY MEN. IT WAS INDICATED THAT THE POSTAL EMPLOYEES
WHOSE NAMES WERE NOT RECALLED MERELY PROVIDED THE MAIL POUCHES
AND WERE NOT PRESENT IN THE ROOM DURING THE SCREENING PROCESS.
IT WAS ALSO STATED THAT ANY MAIL REMOVED AND BROUGHT TO THE NYO
WAS RETURNED TO THE AIRPORT FOR DISPATCH ON THE NEXT OUTGOING
FLIGHT, TO THE CITY OF DESTINATION.

Memorandum for Mr. McDermott
Re: REQUEST BY U. S. SENATOR WALTER F.
MONDALE, SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE
MEMBER, TO REVIEW HIS FBI FILES
The Senator raised a question concerning a folder on the
Consumers Advisory Council, of which he was a member (62-108230-1)
and inquired how we came into possession of this particular report. I
determined that this report had been sent to Mr. Hoover in September,
1962, by Richard Berlin, President of the Hearst Corporation, as he
felt Mr. Hoover would be interested in reading the report. I advised
Mr. Aaron that the report had been sent to Mr. Hoover by a friend of
his in the newspaper field.

Berglund dated March 10, 1966, at Minneapolis captioned
"MILES WELTON LORD; United States Attorney District of
Minnesota, Administrative Inquiry - Bribery," Mr. Adams
mentioned to Senator Mondale there were privacy considera-
tions concerning this report and Senator Mondale limited
his review of this document to information pertaining
to himself set forth on pages 35b and 36.

Subsequent to the meeting, David Aaron advised that the
Senator requested to be advised as to why certain serials of sensitive
coverage (technical coverage on foreign embassies) seemed to end in
1970 and I advised him that in recent years our indexing procedures in
such matters have not called for indexing the name of a Congressman or
C
it has not been indexed for - 4-

Prior to departing for the USSR, BATOREWICZ
was advanced $1,000 for travel and living expenses. Upon her
return she was asked to repay this money. She was unable to
do so since she had spent the money during her travel in Europe.
Upon being advised that the funds must be repaid, she became
quite upset and pointed out that she has been put to considerable
inconvenience. (5-1) (5) (0)
On 7/21/65, Mr. EMOND learned that BATOREWICZ. had
contacted Congressman JOSEPH-KARTH and Senator WALTER MONDALE,
both of Minnesota and related the full facts of her employment
with USIA and subsequent abrupt recall from the Soviet Union
along with comments her being expected to repay the $1,000
advance in funds. (5-1) (5) (U)
As related by Mr. EMOND, Congressman KARTH and Senator
MONDALE have both contacted USIA and requested all details. He
said it looks as if there will be a "considerable stink" about
the matter. (S-1) (8) (0)

Reference is made to your memorandum July 16, 1975,
captioned as above, requesting information relating to the
collection, analysis, use, and dissemination of organized
crime intelligence and a second request related to what extent
have communications between the White House and the FBI or
other agencies under the jurisdiction of the Attorney General
bypassed the Attorney General and to what extent should such
communications be channeled through the Attorney General.
In response to the first matter, on June 25, 1974,
I testified before the FBI Oversight Subcommittee of the
Senate Judiciary Committee that the Bureau has "no statutory
authority to collect intelligence per se" but that it operates
under the general umbrella of 28 U.S.C. 533 (3), which
authorizes the Attorney General to appoint officials "to
conduct...investigations regarding official matters...as may
be directed by the Attorney General." A listing of any
directives issued by the Department or the Attorney General
with respect to organized crime should be available in the
office of the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division,
Department of Justice.
EX-103 REC-162-116315-510
With respect to the FBI, all our investigations in
the organized crime field are aimed at one ultimate objective:
1 AUG 13 1975
prosecution.
t
During the course of our investigation of indivianal
Dep. AD Adm. hoodlums and the various criminal syndicates operating through-
Dep. AD Inv. -out the United States, we naturally acquire considerable data
regarding the structure of the organized underworld, the
Comp. Syst. identities of its principal leaders, the extent of its in-
Files & Com. Iluence, its primary sources of income, its payoffs to corrupt
officials, and the operations of its vast communications networks.

The Attorney General
With the exceptions as noted above, the FBI has
adhered to a policy that when information is given to the
White House the Attorney General is given the same information
contemporaneously. Most of this information relates to current
matters pertaining to the national security. This dissemination
to the White House is sometimes based on requests from the
White House but more frequently on the initiative of the FBI.
With regard to any correspondence directed to this
Bureau from the White House, short of a file by file review,
there is no means of determining whether or not such communica-
tions bypassed the Attorney General.
The established rule of furnishing the Attorney
General copies of correspondence to the White House should be
followed strictly so that the Attorney General is kept fully
informed on matters of interest to him.

The Attorney General
Most of this information is obtained from paid
informants, from other law enforcement officers, from alert
citizons, and from court-approved electronic surveillances
installed under the provisions of Title III of the Omnibus Crime
Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968.
None of it, however, is intelligence for intelligence's
sako. The experionco of the FBI over the years has shown that
criminal syndicates exist for the sole purpose of conducting
illegal operations and that anyone belonging to them may
reasonably be presumed to be engaged in one or more of these
activities. Therefore, our investigations of the organized
underworld are not aimed at developing general nonspecific
data but at establishing which criminal violations its members
are engaged in and then proving these violations in a court
of law.
Obviously, not every case opened, overy lead followed,
or every bit of information received is going to wind up in
Federal court. On the contrary, much of this material relates
to offenses outside the investigative jurisdiction of the
FBI. When such is the case, we immediately discominato tho
information to the appropriate Federal, state, or local agency.
As a result, information uncovered by the FBI during the past
five years alone has enabled the recipient agencies to make
more than 17,000 organized crime arrests; confiscate over
0151,000,000 worth of illicit drugs and narcotics, 09,000,000
worth of cash, property, weapons, and wagering paraphernalia,
and 6,000,000 worth of counterfeit bills; and assess tax
liens against 19,000,000 worth of property arising out of
Federal gambling cases.
In addition, a considerable portion of the organized
crime intelligence information doveloped by the FBI is for-
warded to the various Fedcral Strike Forces coordinating
racket investigations throughout the country and to the
Criminal Division of the Department, which has entered this
information in its computerized data bank called "Racketeer
Profile."

On 7-18-75 Michael Epstein, staff member of the
Senate Select Committee, advised that he desires to interview the
following Agents: Donald P. Burgess, Robert W. Thomson, O. Richard
Hamilton, Charles T. Haynes and Alden F. Miller, all of the Atlanta Office.
Additionally, he requested that SA W. John Benton of the Knoxville Office
be made available in Atlanta. All interviews will be conducted on Tuesday,
7-22-75. The scope of the interviews will be the Bureau investigation of
Martin Luther King. K. William O'Connor, Special Counsel for Intelligence
Coordination in the Department, advised Assistant Director John A. Mintz
on 7-18-75 that staff interviews would no longer be considered a demand
and thus no longer necessitate a waiver of the Code of Federal Regulations
provisions concerning interviews.
After securing the approval of Robert H. Cahill of the
Administrative Division for the travel of Benton to Atlanta, SAC Harold C.
Swanson, Knoxville Office, was telephonically advised on 7-18-75 to
arrange that Benton be available in Atlanta, 7-22-75.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
(1) That existing employment agreements of the aforementioned
Special Agents be waived for purposes of this interview.

By memorandum dated 4/23/75, you were advised that
former Intelligence Division Supervisor Lish Whitson reported
to the writer that he had been interviewed by Mike Epstein of
the Senate Select Committee Staff regarding the Martin Luther
King case. Whitson had participated in activity at the
direction of former Assistant to the Director, William C.
Sullivan, relating to the mailing of a package from Florida
to King's office. The package had been delivered to Whitson
at National Airport on a Saturday by someone unknown to
Whitson.
At 5:30 p.m., today, Whitson telephoned the writer
to state that he had been contacted by phone just a few
minutes before by Mike Epstein. He said that the latter
asked him, Whitson, if the person who had met him at
National Airport and turned the package over to him was

The Attorney General
In response to the second request in your letter,
my answer is restricted to communications between the White
House and the FBI as it would not be appropriate for me to
attempt to respond for other agencies under your jurisdiction.
There are two major areas in which the Attorney
General does not see communications between the White House
and the FBI. They are the results of name checks and the
results of full field investigations we do for the White House.
The White House requests approximately 13,000 name checks per
year concerning persons who visit the White House complex who
could pose a physical threat or possible embarrassment to the
President directly or indirectly. Approximately 1,000 full
field background investigations on Presidential appointoos,
members of the White House staff, and other persons having
regular access to the White House are requested annually.
I direct your attention to Section 0.15 (b) (7).
Title 28, Code of Federal Regulations, which states that the
Deputy Attorney General shall "Coordinate Departmental liaison
with the White House staff and the Executive Office of the
President." When this order was promulgated there were
discussions between the Department and Bureau officials as
to its implementation and its impact on oxisting direct
liaison between the FBI and the White House. My letter to
the Attorney Gonoral, May 2, 1974, captioned "Revision of the
Department of Justice Organization Regulations (28 CFR Part 0),"
sot forth the FBI's need for a Special Agent-Liaison officer
to handle day to day operational liaison with the White House.
His activities were outlined and it was requested that he
continue to handle operational problems on a daily basis
with specific individuals because of the sensitivity of the
matters involved, both of a personal security and intelligence
nature.
By memorandum dated May 16, 1974, captioned "Direct
Operational Liaison with the White House," the Attorney General
authorized the continuance of FBI direct operational liaison
with the White House.

Attached is a copy of a Departmental memorandum which
interprets "demand" under 28 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 16.21
et seq. for the purpose of dealing with the Senate Select Committee. The
provisions of 16 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 16.21 et seq. requires
Departmental approval in those instances where a current or former
employee in response to a demand of a court or authority is required
to furnish material contained in Departmental files or disclose information
contained therein.
The Department decision as set forth in the attachment
characterizes all requests by Senate Select Committee staff members
as a demand which requires a waiver from the Department prior to the
employee's submission to the Committee request.
-
-
REC-1 62-116345-506
According to the Departmental position concerning demand,
the Director or "the FBI General Counsel" in coordination with the Special
Counsel for Intelligence Coordination of the Department may waive the
provision of 28 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 16.21 et seq. This
is in accordance with the provision of Title 28, Code of Federal Regulations,
Section 16.23.

14 AUG 11 1975
Upon receipt of the attached documents, SA Paul V. Daly
and Inspector John B. Hotis of this Division sought clarification concerning
the Departmental interpretation of "demand" as set forth in attachment,
including whether this interpretation applied to the General Accounting
Office (GAO) inquiry into the Bureau. K. William O'Connor, Special
Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, stated he believed this might also
apply to GAO, however, he had not really thought out this point. He was
also asked what was meant by the phrase, "in coordination with this office."
Mr. O'Connor indicated that he wanted to be notified of requests for interviews
and that was what he meant by the phrase, "in coordination with this office."

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams Memo
RE: SENSTUDY 75
He was advised by SA Daly that we had previously received requests
for the interview of a number of employees in Atlanta, Georgia, by the
Committee and that upon receipt of the attached communication, after
consultation with Deputy Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination
Michael Shaheen, SA Daly had telephonically informed John Elliff, head
of the domestic intelligence task force for the Committee, of the
Department's interpretation as set forth in the attached document and
the fact that Mr. Elliff should contact Mr. O'Connor concerning these
proposed interviews. Mr. O'Connor said that he had been contacted by
Mr. Elliff and had, in fact, told Mr. Elliff there would be no interviews.
In this regard, O'Connor stated the Department had prepared a proposed
draft letter to the Committee expressing concern for the Fifth Amendment
rights for Bureau employees and raising other legal issues. Mr. O'Connor
indicated that the finalized form of this letter should be sent to the
Committee in the near future.
The results of the conversation with John Elliff by O'Connor
have caused the Office of Legal Analysis to receive complaints concerning
this decision from various Committee staff members, including Mark
Gitenstein and Michael Epstein. We can anticipate, unless this particular
problem is resolved, receiving protests from their superiors on the
Committee.
RECOMMENDATION:
You will be kept advised of developments concerning this
matter. Legal Analysis Office will continue efforts to determine what
effect this will have on the GAO inquiry.

SUBJECT: Interpretation of "Demand",
28 C.F.R., § 16.21, et seq.
-
"To Bill O'e.
Action Memorandum
if
The meaning of "demand" is not indicated, beyond subpoena, in
the C.F.R. sections indicated. This omission creates a need for an
interpretation, for purposes of uniform Department of Justice reaction.
Outlines for inquiry proceedings were agreed upon between the
White House and the Senate Select Committee on June 13, 1975, and a
copy of those procedures was furnished to the Department on June 16,
1975. Under those guidelines, there is a general undertaking by the
Committee to identify witnesses to the Agency a reasonable time before
the interviews occur. This general rule includes current and former
employees; certain exceptions (not clearly defined) are indicated in
the guidelines. The Committee is required to provide the witness with
a copy of the procedures, and "relevant waivers of secrecy oaths or
agreements for the purpose of this inquiry". The Committee is required
to give prior notice of an interview, generally, specifying: (a) sub-
ject area;3B (b) periods of employment%3B (c) the date set for the interview.
Since these structured procedures, taken with the rules of the
Subcommittee, may create a requirement of testimony upon witnesses, it
seems to me clear that the paragraphs of 28 C.F.R., § 16.21, et seq.,
which refer to "demand" should be interpreted to include any request
by any Committee staff member to interview any employee, former employee
or other person connected with the Department of Justice.
This interpretation requires certain action: (1) that the wit-
ness be authorized to speak under § 16.23 by an appropriate Department
Official; and, (2) that an appropriate Department Official be designated.
I would think that the appropriate Department Official for the FBI should
be the Director of the FBI or the FBI General Counsel, in coordination
with this office.

As a matter of current practice, the FBI and other components
of the Department are presently coordinating with me on agreements
for disclosure under § 16.23, as a system for ensuring that they are
receiving treatment consistent with the outlines of inquiry procedure
and the agreements between the Committee and the Department.
If you approve, I will advise the involved components of the
Department of Justice that the word "demand" will be interpreted as
indicated for each witness.

Pate you
On July 23, 1975, Mike Gitenstein, staff
member Senate Select Committee, requested that he
be given a briefing concerning "Official and Con-
fidential" files. By way of background, we furnished
a summary of the inspection inquiry to the Committee
by letterhead memorandum dated 7-16-75, and also
made available for review in Bureau space a list of
people contacted during the course of this inquiry.
With regard to Gitenstein's request it would
appear beneficial for us to brief the Senate Select
Committee representative concerning the scope and
details of this inquiry. In this regard it appears
Gitenstein is interested in those individuals who
were contacted by the Inspection Division during their
inspection into the "Official and Confidential"
files.
If approved the briefing will be tentatively
scheduled for Friday, July 25, 1975.
RECOMMENDATION:
That a briefing be arranged for Gitenstein
concerning the "Official and Confidential" files
inspection inquiry by Inspection Division.

The file contained the results of a criminal investigation
conducted by the Bureau. The Intelligence, General
Investigative and Special Investigative Divisions were
requested to furnish their views concerning this matter
and the Legal Counsel Division was to prepare a letter
to the Department setting forth the Bureau's position
with regard to this matter.

We have since had discussions with the Attorney

Senate Select Committee access to Bureau files and
submitted correspondence to the Department concerning
this matter. It would appear additional communications
to the Department are unnecessary. The Department is
well aware of our position in this matter.

We do not prepare a communication to the
Department concerning this matter.

I advised Mr. Callahan that the position of the FBI and the
Department is that we could not provide counsel directly to the individuals
because of the potential conflict of interest between the rights of the
individual and the duties of our officers. However, I told him that to my
knowledge the question concerning whether the Government could pay for
private counsel selected by the employee has not been researched.
Mr. Callahan therefore requested that the research be conducted.
RECOMMENDATION:
That the Administrative Division and Legal Counsel confer
and prepare an appropriate response to Mr. Callahan's request.

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE
ACTIVITIES (SSC); INTERVIEW OF ASSISTANT
DIRECTOR IN CHARGE ROBERT E. GEBHARDT BY
SSC STAFF MEMBER
REVOLUTION
AMERICAN
On August 7, 1975, Assistant Director Robert E.
Gebhardt, Los Angeles Division, was interviewed in the Los
Angeles FBI Office by Mr. Lester Seidel, Staff Member of
the Senate Select Committee, United States Senate.
Gebhardt's rights were not explained to him by
Seidel although Seidel did explain the purpose of the
interview, that is the Cointel Program of the FBI as it
related to the FBI's investigation of the Black Panther Party
when Gebhardt was the Special Agent in Charge of the San
Francisco Division from 1970 to 1972.
The interview lasted from 9:05 AM until 10:30 AM,
and it was not necessary for Gebhardt to consult with any
Bureau representative.
Gebhardt had previously been advised by a Bureau
representative of his right to counsel, the privileged areas
of information, consultation privileges, and the parameters
of interview.
Seidel inquired at the outset as to whether Gebhardt
was aware of the Cointel Program relative to the Black Panther
Party investigation on a day-to-day basis being specifically
advised details of the investigation as it relates to the
, Cointel Program. It was explained to Seidel that as Special
Agent in Charge of the San Francisco FBI Office wherein
over 500 employees were located at the time, Gebhardt had
many responsibilities in the operation of that division and
BICENTENNIAL

therefore, relied upon the experience, expertise, and judgment
of the various supervisors assigned to the office for the
day-to-day direction of the various matters under investigation,
including the investigation of the Black Panther Party.
It was further explained that if a problem was
encountered or a particularly unusual situation developed,
Gebhardt was, of course, consulted and was available for
such consultation to resolve any particular problem areas.
Gebhardt was next asked if he recalled being SAC
when the electronic coverage of the Black Panther Party and
the various officials at BBP was instituted and eventually
terminated. Seidel was advised that the electronic coverage
was already in effect upon Gebhardt's arrival, however, he
does recall receiving a phone call after the "Keith Decision"
was handed down instructing that all electronic coverage of
the BPP and the various members of the BPP be discontinued.
The call was received from Bureau Headquarters and the
discontinuance was effected immediately.
Seidel inquired as to whether Gebhardt felt the
intelligence type investigations should be completely removed
from the criminal investigations which investigations would be
looking toward eventual prosecution.
In
Seidel was informed by Gebhardt that even in criminal
investigations looking toward prosecutions, much intelligence
information is obtained from time to time which really has no
value from a prosecutive standpoint, but does have possible
value with respect to the direction of the investigation.
some criminal investigations a great deal of intelligence
information may be obtained and in other types, very little.
Insofar as the FBI is concerned, however, every effort is
made to make certain there is some Federal law which would be
a basis for an investigation which procedures would include
matters commonly referred to as security investigations.
In some instances, in such security investigations.
a great deal of intelligence information would be obtained
therefore, it was Gebhardt's opinion that so-called intelli-
gence type investigations should not be removed from or
differentiated from criminal type investigations looking
toward prosecutions since intelligence information is an
outgrowth of the basic investigation.

standardize their oversight responsibilities and make regular
inquiries of the Director and other officials of the FBI as
to our activities. He was informed that there should be
either a joint oversight committee between the House and
Senate or if the Congress decided on two oversight Committees
in both the House and Senate, these committees should be the
entities through which all information relative to the
activities of the FBI should flow.
It was emphasized however, that there should be
regular consultation between these representatives and the
FBI.
Inquiry was made as to Gebhardt's opinion relative
to the relationship between the Department of Justice and
the FBI and Seidel was informed the relationship, in Gebhardt's
opinion, is excellent, should continue, and there should be
a free flow of information between the FBI and the Department
of Justice.
At the conclusion of the interview, Gebhardt summed
up his comments by stating that Congress should definitely
set up a structured oversight procedure of the activities
of the FBI with due regard to the confidentiality of many
of the FBI operations and investigations and must assure
itself that the members of the Committee and its staff will
maintain the confidentiality where necessary.
Secondly, in the areas of investigative matters
usually referred to as national defense, national security
or intelligence operations, all of the FBI investigations
must be based on the application of the facts toward a
particular Federal statute and if the facts are so oblique
that they cannot be clearly applied to a particular Federal
statute, consultation with the Department of Justice should
be had in all instances.

Gebhardt was asked if he felt the Cointelpro was a
separate entity distinguished from the basic investigation
and it was explained that the Cointelpro was a phase of the
overall investigation in any particular organization or
individual.
Gebhardt was asked if he felt Congress should enact
legislation which would set forth specific investigative
techniques that could or could not be utilized by the FBI or
other Federal investigative agencies. He was advised in
Gebhardt's opinion, such legislation should not be enacted,
and in reply to the question as to why such legislation should
not be enacted, it was pointed out that as an investigative
agency, there must of necessity be allowed a certain flexi-
bility because no two investigations are exactly alike and the
circumstances of such investigations could possibly not be
related to such Federal law.
In answer to the question as to how Congress should
assure the American public that questionable activity such
as the Cointelpro, was not being engaged in by an investigative
agency such as the FBI, Seidel was informed that the Congress
and the American people must rely upon the integrity and
honesty of the Director of the FBI and the Attorney General.
It was pointed out that both the Director of the
FBI and the Attorney General are nominated by the President,
hearings are held before the various Congressional Committees
and finally approved by the Senate. It was further pointed
out that Director Kelley has recently stated in connection with
the publicity relative to Cointelpro, that he has no intention
of permitting this program to be reinstituted in the FBI and
if circumstances ever arose which circumstances he could not
contemplated at this time, wherein it was thought such
activities should be embarked upon, he would obtain the personal
approval of the Attorney General prior to such instituting.
Seidel was informed that Gebhardt was in total agreement with
this statement of Mr. Kelley.
Gebhardt was asked as to what his feelings were
relative to what the relationship should be between the FBI
and Congress. He was informed that a Senate Oversight
Committee was recently established and it was felt that this
was a good start and that this Committee should formalize and

At 10 a.m., on 6-18-75, Mr. William Miller,
Staff Director Senate Select Committee on Intelligence
Activities called Inspector John B. Hotis to advise that
he heard a report on the radio earlier that morning
concerning the alleged penetration of Congressional
and Senatorial offices by the KGB or agents of Soviet
bloc Nations. Miller said he did not have any further
details and stated he was uncertain whether the report
alleged actual penetration of the offices or simply
increased contacts by the Soviets with Members of Congress.
Miller said he believed the source of the report was a
television interview of Senator Goldwater (R-Arizona)
on Sunday, 6-15-75.
Mr. Miller said the members of the Senate
Committee were concerned about these allegations and
asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation to inquire
into the matter. Assistant Director Wannall has been
advised of this request.

RECOMMENDATION:
In view of the sensitivity of this matter, it
is recommended that the Intelligence Division prepare

Regal Counsel memorandum to you dated 7-8-75
captioned "Senate Select Committee on Intelligence
Activities, recommended that the Administrative Division
and Legal Counsel Division confer and prepare an appropriate
response to Mr. Callahan's request that research be con-
ducted to determine whether the FBI or the Department of
Justice would be authorized to pay for private counsel for
employees who are called to testify before the Senate
Select Committee and who desire private counsel. We have
also undertaken to present the statutory considerations
governing the provision of such representation in a legal
proceeding as distinguished from a legislative hearing.
Title 5, United States Code, Section 3106, states:
"Except as otherwise authorized
by law, the head of an Executive
department or military department
may not employ an attorney or
31-539
counsel for 100 con 30
tion in which the United States,
-an agency, or an employee thereof AUG 1 1975
is a party, or is interested, or
for the securing of evidence there -
for, but shall refer the matter to
the Department of Justice.
"
This statutory prohibition makes it clear that
only the Attorney General has the authority to make a
contract for special employment of an attorney. This
Bureau, as an agency of the Department of Justice, ob-
viously does not have authority to do that which is
denied to Executive departments which are otherwise of
coequal stature to the Department of Justice.

Memorandum to Mr. J. B. Adams
Re:
Authority of FBI and Department of Justice
to Retain Private Counsel to Represent Employees
An examination of our budgetary language by
representatives of the Administrative Division and this
Division does not disclose any explicit or implicit
authority which would qualify as "otherwise authorized by
law, .
". under the above statute. The statutory
authority for provision of private counsel is contained in
Title28, United States Code, Section 515, which gives the
Attorney General the authority to appoint and pay special
attorneys. However, this authority is circumscribed by the
statement that these attorneys "may, when specifically
directed by the Attorney General, conduct any kind of legal
proceeding, civil or criminal, including grand jury pro-
ceedings and proceedings before committing magistrates,
which United States Attorneys are authorized by law to
conduct. .
It is evident then that this authority
pertains only to proceedings held within the judicial
system, not to hearings held before a legislative body.
Such a hearing is not a "legal proceeding" and is not
one "which United States Attorneys are authorized by
law to conduct.
In the event that employees need representation
in a legal proceeding and the Department believes that a
potential conflict of interest would prevent it from
providing counsel, outside counsel could be appointed and
paid under the statute up to the monetary limits fixed.
Whether the Department would allow the individual employee
to designate or select the outside counsel would be a
matter of Departmental policy but we see no reason why
such an individual selection would not ordinarily be
approved.
We are aware that the Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) has recently engaged the law firm of Arnold
and Porter and that Mr. Mitchell Rogovin of that firm
has been designated as the individual attorney to represent
that agency. Inquiry with CIA has determined that the
authority relied on for this action is Title 50, United
States Code, Section 403j, which states:

Memorandum to Mr. J. B. Adams
Re:
Authority of FBI and Department of Justice
to Retain Private Counsel to Represent Employees
" (a) Notwithstanding any other
other provisions of law, sums
made available to the Agency
by appropriation or otherwise
may be expended for purposes
necessary to carry out its
functions, including
--
"(1) personal services, including
personal services without regard
to limitations on types of
persons to be employed.
apparen We would emphasize, however, that the counsel
hired represents the CIA, not individual employees, and
that private counsel has the same problems as does their
"in-house" counsel. Therefore, no firm or individual
hired by that agency can provide counsel to the individual
employee in any situation which presents a potential
conflict between the interests of the individual and the
interests of the agency.
CONCLUSION:
We conclude that there is no authority for either
the FBI or the Department to pay for private counsel
selected by employees called to testify before the Senate
Select Committee or any other legislative body. If an
employee called to testify in such a forum desires private
counsel, or where a potential conflict of interest makes
representation by "in-house" counsel or the Department
impossible, the employee must decide if the possible
consequences warrant the personal expense of such counsel
and, if so, responsibility for payment rests with him.
Furthermore, private counsel retained by an
agency having authority to do so would be under the
same disabilities as "in-house" or Departmental counsel
in situations presenting a potential conflict of interest.

DETAILS:
To advise of receipt of uncorroborated information!
from Philadelphia Office to the effect that a Staff Member:
of the Church Committee reportedly, without authorization, Xeroxed
a CIA document in possession of the Committee for subsequent
transmittal to Congressman Morris Udall.
Senstudy is acronym for Senate Select Committee on
Intelligence Activities (SSC), also known as Church Committee,
which Committee is looking into operations of members of the
intelligence community.
By teletype 7/30/75, our Philadelphia Office advised
that one Robert Thweat, a retired United States Navy Commander,
had made available information he received from an unnamed
relative. This relative told him that one Daniel O'Flaherty,
who is employed with the Church Committee, had on an unknown
date removed from his work area, by hiding underneath his shirt,
a CIA memorandum containing derogatory information on Senator
Henry Jackson, ('Flaherty then Xeroxed the memorandum and
provided the Xeroxed copy to an unknown person for subsequent
transmittal to Congressman Morris Udall. According to The
O'Flaherty had personally related the above information to his
relative and reportedly had also related the incident to a
Mr. Katz, a former associate who is currently a professor at
the University of Vanderbilt, Nashville, Tennessee. Katz

Reference is made to Item V of the August 5, 1975,
request by the SSC for access to screen FBI materials.
Materials considered responsive to the SSC request
have been assembled and are available for review by SSC
Staff Members in Room 4171, JEH Building, regarding the
following parts of Item V:
Part A. Materials pertaining to Mrs. Claire (Anna)
Chennault and Spiro T. Agnew. Regarding Item V., A., 6.,
information pertaining to actions taken by the White House
as a result of information contained in the summary letters
described in Item V., A., 4., is not contained in FBI files.
Regarding Item V., A., 7., the FBI has no record of any former
or current Special Agent (SA) named William Jackson who could
have performed the tasks enumerated in the SSC request.
However, at the time that SA Phil Claridge was assigned to
the Albuquerque Field Office, there was also assigned there
a Special Agent named Cordon Jackson, now retired. The last
knom residence for SA Claridge, who retired June 29, 1973,
is 619 16th Street .W., Albuquerque, New Mexico. The last
knom residence for SA Jackson is 1537 Wellesley Drive .E.,
Albuquerque, New Mexico.

reportedly voiced his displeasure to O'Flaherty stating he
did not approve of the latter's action. The memorandum in
question dealt with CIA's possible use of derogatory information
to determine the direction Senator Jackson would take in future
actions he might encounter which might involve CIA activity
Thweat advised he would recontact his relative to determine if
this individual would come forward, reveal his identity and
be cooperative in any investigation.
· A memorandum from CIA dated 7/29/75 indicates that
James Daniel O'Flaherty, born 11/4/42, is a member of the Staff
of SSC and has been granted a security clearance up to "Top Secret."
On the morning of 7/31/75, Philadelphia Office was
telephonically contacted and instructed to expedite a contact
with Thweat to determine the availability of his relative. At
approximately 2:30 p.m., 7/31/75, Philadelphia Office advised
that Thweat, upon recontact, had stated that it would be impossible
to contact his relative before this coming weekend. In conver-
sation, he identified his relative as a niece who is currently
attending school in Washington, D. C.. He further advised that
O'Flaherty reportedly is no longer residing with his wife and
is engaged in an emotional relationship with his niece. Thweat
added he believed his niece would be cooperative as she has
expressed her disapproval of O'Flaherty's action. He concluded
by saying that upon determination of his niece's decision in
this regard he would immediately advise the Philadelphia Office.
OBSERVATIONS:
The above information, if accurate, represents a
serious violation of the agreement regarding confidentiality
existing between the SSC and members of the intelligence commu-
nity as it relates to material being turned over or made

The Intelligence Division advised Philadelphia Office
telephonically informed FBIHQ on 8/5/75 that Thweat had returned to
Philadelphia from seeing his niece and indicated she would talk to the
FBI on the condition that she would go to Philadelphia about 8/22/75
to talk to the Agent who is a personal friend of Thweat and to whom
he initially confided the information regarding this matter. Philadelphia
was advised in view of the time lag a more preferable alternative
would be for WFO Agents to contact the niece or as another alternative the
Philadelphia Agent would travel to Washington, D. C., to conduct
the interview. Philadelphia was requested to expeditiously recontact
Thweat concerning the above possibilities.

upon this Bureau to make the above information available at
the earliest logical time and in the most complete form
possible to the Department, CIA, and Senators Frank Church
and John G. Tower of the SSC. Accordingly, an interview by
Bureau Agents of Thweat's niece, if she agrees to cooperate,
would appear desirable before initiating any action on the
basis of information received to date.
Additionally, it is not known at this time whether
or not the document reportedly Xeroxed by O'Flaherty is
classified. In our continuing inquiry into this matter,
attempts will be made to identify document, determine whether
it contains classified information and ascertain whether or
not a violation of Federal statutes exists.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. That contact.be maintained with the Philadelphia
Office to insure that the desired information concerning
Thweat's niece be expeditiously obtained. If she agrees to
cooperate, she will be immediately interviewed and pertinent
information obtained . furnished, via established liaison
channels, to the Department, CIA, and Senators Church and Tower.
Appropriate field offices will be instructed to conduct
necessary investigation to corroborate the information and
to determine if a possible violation of Federal statutes has
been committed.

This is to recommend that the Administrative Division
provide a copy of the Foreign Operations Policy Manual, to be
reviewed by the Intelligence Division before presentation to
the SSC for its review.
The 7/28/75 communication from the SSC contains on

prior to being made available to the SSC and if necessary,
deletions from the Manual will be made and the SSC will be
advised of the general nature of the deletions.
RECOMMENDATION:
That the Administrative Division make available to
the Intelligence Division one copy of the Foreign Operations
Policy Manual for review prior to its being made available to
the SSC.

i
On basis of foregoing request, Phillips
telephonically contacted Assistant Director (AD) Mintz
who granted clearance for (1) and (2) above and suggested
withholding clearance on (3) pending further request from
Epstein after interview on items (1) and (2). Mintz asked
that Phillips touch base with AD Wannall for his concurrence.
In the absence of Wannall who was out of the building,
Deputy AD T. Leavitt concurred with Mintz. At about 5:30 p.m.,
7/22/75, Epstein was telephonically advised by Phillips as
indicated above--clearance for (1) and (2)%;B not for (3) at
this time. Arrangements were then made for interview of
Shea morning of 7/23/75.
Subsequent interview of Shea (being reported
separately) apparently satisfied Epstein and it does not
appear there will be any further request as to item (3).
ACTION:
None. For information.

This memorandum records Bureau waiver from secrecy
agreement for interview of Atlanta Field Office (FO) SA Edward A.
Shea by Senate Select Committee (SSC) Staff Members at Atlanta,
7/22-23/75.
:)
Supervisor S. F. Phillips of the Senstudy 75 Project
was in Atlanta 7/22/75 in connection with the interviews there
of six SAs (five from Atlanta FO3B one who traveled to Atlanta
from Knoxville FO) by SSC Staff Members Michael Epstein and
Mary DeOreo. Interviews concerned the former FBI investigation
of Martin Luther King, Jr. At approximately 5:00 p.m.,
7/22/75, Epstein telephonically contacted Phillips and advised
that one of the interviews developed information resulting in
his desire to interview a seventh SA, Edward A. Shea of the
Atlanta FO. In order to avoid another trip to Atlanta,
Epstein asked if Phillips could obtain FBI clearance for the
interview which would concern: (1) any possible COINTELPRO
operations in Atlanta with respect to King or the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC); (2) Shea's assignment
to a "file review or file retrieval" project during past year
concerning COINTELPRO; and (3) concerning COINTELPRO "generally."
(It should be noted that earlier this year, Shea handled a
project relating to classifying documents in Atlanta files
regarding COINTELPRO. Shea advised. Phillips of this and also
said that he does not recall seeing any documents regarding
COINTELPRO/SCLC - KING.) Epstein desired to interview Shea
the morning of 7/23/75. REC 17 62-116375-538

This memorandum records that no effort is being
made to respond to a request of the Senate Select Committee
(SSC) dated 6/27/75, pursuant to instructions of the
Deputy Attorney General, until such time as the Department
can obtain clarification from the SSC regarding the meaning
of paragraph 2 in the SSC's letter of 6/27/75.
Memorandum Wannall to Adams, dated 6/30/75, reviewed
a draft copy of the SSC's letter to the Department. This
draft copy is dated 6/25/75. It is identical in content with
the final version dated 6/27/75.
Memorandum Cregar to Wannall, dated 7/2/75, reported
the results of a meeting in the office of the Deputy Attorney
General on the morning of 7/2/75. In this memorandum it was
pointed out that the Deputy Attorney General found considerable
difficulty in understanding paragraph 2 of the SSC's draft of
a letter dated 6/25/75. He noted that in view of the
ambiguities found in the letter, as well as the lack of any
specific agreement entered into with the SSC by the Department.
and/or the FBI, the Department should prepare a letter over
the Attorney General's signature asking for clarification.
In the meantime, the Deputy Attorney General advised that we
should take no action responsive to the requests levied on
the FBI in this letter. To date, we have received no infor-
mation from the Department that a letter asking for clarification
of the SSC has been sent.

Within the Committee mandate, contained in
S. Res. 21, there are four broad subjects relating to the
intelligence community which we are required to investi-
gate and study in order to determine the facts and ulti-
mately to decide whether to make recommendations for
legislative or other changes. They are:
2.
The structure, performance, and utility of
government operations with respect to intel-
ligence activities.
Whether certain policies or practices are
or are not illegal, unethical, or otherwise
improper.
3. Whether there has or has not been excessive
duplication or inadequate coordination be-
tween and among intelligence agencies and,
more generally, the efficiency of intelli-
gence activities.
4°
Whether there has or has not been adequate
internal and external control and oversight
over the policies and practices of intelli-
gence agencies.
In attempting to find the answers to these funda-
mental questions, the Committee is proceeding in two ways.
First, we are examining intelligence functions broadly as
instruments of government policy, giving attention to the
authority for particular functions, the problems which
intelligence activities are designed to solve, the proce-
dures by which intelligence activities are and have been
proposed, approved, executed, evaluated, and terminated,
the range and scope of the activities utilized to achieve
intelligence objectives, and the propriety and utility of
the activities undertaken. Second, we will examine in
depth certain subjects within the broad topics of inves-
tigation. (We would, of course, welcome your suggestion
of other cases that would give added insight into intelli-
gence matters under your jurisdiction.) These specific
subjects for investigation are not intended to limit the
scope contained in the more general questions.

The annexed notifications spell these matters
out in greater detail. In addition, they ask certain
specific questions, set forth certain previously requested
documents not yet received, request additional documents,*
and, in some cases, ask for the names and present addresses
of persons who have held certain positions. Where appro-
priate, the subject's description indicates that, pursuant
to the agreed Outline for Inquiry Procedures, the matter
primarily concerns allegations of abuse or other contro-
versial specific matters where there is reason to believe
improprieties may have occurred. Finally, the notifications
indicate the name(s) of the staff member(s) who, in addition
to the Committee's senior staff, will be responsible for the
particular matters.
i The Committee, in the course of the next few
months, will undertake other subjects for investigation
as its work proceeds and will notify you as appropriate.
We look forward to your cooperation in these
matters.

As a means of examining the above issues in the
context of actual FBI intelligence operations,
the Committee intends to study certain specific
topics, some of which are general in nature, and
others of which involve specific cases, programs
or techniques. Part II, below, contains descriptions
of the general areas into which the Committee: intends
to inquire. Part III contains descriptions of the
specific cases mentioned above. The descriptions
specifically indicate whether the investigation may
concentrate on specific allegations of possible
abuses or other controversial matters where there
is reason to believe improprieties may have occurred.
In addition to the topics described below, additional
areas of inquiry may develop during the course of the
Committee's work.

The Committee's inquiry focuses on the following
specific areas:
1. FBI Internal Security Intelligence Operations
-
2.
The Committee seeks to determine the nature
and purpose of FBI intelligence operations
directed at foreign intelligence activities
and subversive or extremist activities within
the United States. It has been alleged that
the scope of FBI intelligence investigations
is too broad and has extended to legitimate
political activities. Consequently, the Com-
mittee must examine how the FBI's responsibili-
ties have been defined.
Responsible staff: Senior staff
Task Force leader
Mark Gitenstein
The FBI and the U. S. Intelligence Community
The Committee seeks to determine what have
been the policies and procedures for coordina-
tion between the FBI and other agencies in the
--U. S. intelligence community. There have been
occasions in the past where friction between
the FBI and other agencies has produced serious
dissatisfaction within the U. S. intelligence
community. The purpose of this inquiry is to
evaluate the adequacy of past and present co-
ordinating mechanisms.

5. FBI Intelligence Activities and State or Local
Law Enforcement Agencies
The Committee seeks to determine the nature of
the relationships between FBI intelligence
. activities and state and local law enforcement
agencies. This subject involves the delicate
balance between the necessary contralization
of certain law enforcement activities and the
Constitutionally-mandated decentralization of
general law enforcement responsibility. It is
necessary for the Committee to evaluate the
centralizing influence of the FBI, as well as
the FBI's role as a check on local law enforce-
ment abuses.

Areas of General Inquiry
%
A. Legal Authority. for FBI Intelligence and Counter-
intelligence Activities
B.
The Committee is examining the legal basis for FBI
intelligence and counterintelligence activities.
There may be serious question as to the adequacy
of the present legislative framework for the FBI'S
functions in these fields. Current statutes
• authorize the FBI to perform investigative and law
enforcement functions, but they do not specifically
authorize intelligence or counterintelligence
‘activities. Therefore; the Committee seeks to
determine whether the FBI's authority should be
clarified, revised, or incorporated in a compre-
hensive statutory charter.

Organization and Operation of the FBI Intelli-
gence Division
The Committee is investigating the structure and
operating practices of the FBI Intelligence Divi-
sion. Proposals have been made that the national
security intelligence and counterintelligence
functions of the FBI should be lodged in a separate
agency or otherwise separated from the FBI's
criminal investigative activities. Further recom-
mendations have been advanced for improved coordina-
tion between the FBI and other intelligence agencies,
for strengthened supervision of FBI intelligence and
counterintelligence activities by the Attorney
General or an independent board, and for clearer
standards and procedures for FBI activities in this
area. Therefore, the Committee desires complete
information on the operating practices and proce-
dures of the FBI Intelligence Division and of the
field office activities supervised by the Intelli-
gence Division.

FBI Foreign Counterintelligence Operations
The Committée seeks to determine the nature of
FBI counterintelligence operations directed at
foreign intelligence activities within the
United States or at any other hostile foreign-
related activities within the United States.
Since FBI operations to "counter" these activi-
ties go beyond intelligence collection, the
Committee must consider whether such practices
require statutory authorization. The impact
of counterintelligence operations on United
States foreign relations will also be considered..

tion with FBI intelligence activities.

Electronic Surveillance
The Committee is examining all forms of electronic
interception of communications including wiretap-
ping, electronic eavesdropping, consensual elec-
tronic surveillance interception of video and data
communications, local monitoring devices, and all
other forms of electronic or technical monitoring.
The Committee's general questions apply to each of
the techniques listed above, as well as to the
matters
set forth in the following specific cases.
*1. Warrantless Electronic Surveillance
The Committee seeks to determine whether the
Attorney General should have the authority
to authorize electronic surveillance for cer-
tain purposes without a prior judicial warrant.
This power has been exercised by succeeding
Attorneys General since 1940, upon the explicit
directive of the President. The Supreme Court
has ruled that this power does not extend to
purely domestic matters, but the remaining scope
of the Attorney General's authority remains un-
defined by the Supreme Court.
Questions
The Committee requests that the FBI and the
Justice Department address the following specific
questions:
a.
b.
c.
What is the scope and basis of the claim
of Executive authority to conduct warrant-
less electronic surveillance?
What have been the procedures for considera-
tion and approval of requests for warrantless
electronic surveillance authorized by the
Attorney General?
What are the specific disadvantages of the
judicial warrant requirement for those
electronic surveillances which have been
authorized by the Attorney General?

F. Clandestine Informant Activities
The Committee is examining all aspects of the
FBI's use of informants, sources, and undercover
personnel and the techniques employed by such per-
sons. Although informants are the single most
productive source of intelligence information, the
difficulties of controlling their activities may
increase the possibility of improper conduct. The
use of informants to infiltrate organizations also
may pose dangers to the right of associational pri-
vacy. Consequently, proposals have been made for
the imposition of a judicial warrant requirement
or other safeguards for the use of informants.
The Committee seeks to evaluate such proposals as
well as the contributions of informants to the
accomplishment of legitimate objectives.
In addition, the Committee is examining informant
activities with respect to several particular situa-
tions and cases. This investigation may involve
specific allegations of abuse or controversial
matters where there is reason to believe improprie-
ties may have occurred. The Committee's inquiry
covers the general circumstances surrounding the
following incidents or cases:
a.
b.
Wounded Knee;
Kent State%3B
c. New York v. Stroble (Attica)%;B
d.
United States v. Buckalew (Gainesville)%;B
e. United States v. Briggs (Camden);B
f.
New York v. Dillon (Hobart College);B
g. United States v. Marshall (Seattle).
Additional cases may also be examined.
In addition to the above cases, the Committee is
examining the role of FBI informants in providing
information to the FBI concerning members of the
following organizations:

potential informants who became paid infor-
mants in connection with security, intelli-
gence, and counterintelligence matters, cases,
and programs from 1960 until the present?
Documents

The "Huston Plan"

The Committee is examining the FBI's role in the
disposition of the report of the Interagency Com-
mittee on Intelligence (Ad Hoc) in 1970. This
report as submitted to the President included cer-
tain options which were specifically identified as
"illegal". It purported to represent the joint
recommendations of all members of the U. S. intel-
ligence community, but FBI Director J. Edgar
Hoover disagreed in a series of footnotes.
The serious consideration given to such al-.
legedly illegal proposals gives this case
. the utmost significance for the Committee's under-.
standing of the risks of uncontrolled intelligence
activity. This case may involve specific allega-
tions of abuse and controversial matters where
there is reason to believe improprieties may have
occurred.

In accord with our telephone conversation of August 12th,
I am forwarding to you a letter from the Senate Select
Committee requesting answers to questions relating to
electronic surveillance conducted by the Federal govern-
ment in the interests of national security. The Committee
has been told that we would try to respond to their
request by August 20th. That date is fast approaching
and may not be a reasonable period of time in which to
compile the information requested and respond to their
questions. That date is a useful target, however, since.
any issues to be presented to the Attorney General with
iespect to complying to this request must be considered
prior to August 19th, the date the Attorney General is
scheduled to leave Washington.
Would your office please prepare responses to the following
questions that involve areas with which, I believe, you
are familiar: questions 2-10, 11 (b)-(d), 12, 14, 15, 17,
21 and 24.
Thank you.

I believe that the answers to these questions“
are e sential to a complete understanding of the policies
and ] :ocedures followed by the Justice Department in elec-
tron c surveillance cases. Full information on these mat-
ters is necessary for the Committee to fulfill its mandate
"to recommend the enactment of any new legislation .

nec sary or desirable to strengthen or clarify the national
security, intelligence, or surveillance activities of the
United States and to protect the rights of United States

that the Committee, will be able to discharge this respon-
sibility in the critical area of national security electronic
surveillance.

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

#mpe 16
19/10/00 SP2 ALM/JTE
Thank you for your letters of June 24 and June
25, 1975, Kelating to electronic surveillance conducted by
the federal government in the interests of national secu-
rity and foreign intelligence. The Select Committee also
appreciates your providing the information of a sensitive
nature in your separate letter of June 24, 1975.
Your letters, and the recent testimony of Kevin
T. Maroney and Clarence M. Kelley before the House Sub-
committee on Courts, Civil Liberties, and the Administration
of Justice, have raised several additional questions which
the Committee wishes to pursue. Further questions are
raised by the July 1, 1975, White House news briefing by
the Press Secretary relating to the effect of the recent
Zweibon decision. Some of these questions relate to general
policy considerations in the electronic surveillance area;
others address our need for a more complete factual base
from which we can draw our conclusions. A list of these
questions is attached to this letter. These questions, of
course, do not supersede prior requests for material
relating to electronic surveillance, which are itemized in
the document requests of May 14, June 16, and June 27.
Rather, they should be considered as supplementary to
the prior requests.
