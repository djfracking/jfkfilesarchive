"Former contacte bac Station
In my xind te
able personal courage, good security and common sense,
is the ideal type of Latin American agent. It will be a real loss to
the Agency if we lose sight or contact with adolfo. I have net few men
more dedicated and more loyal.

5. Ramon WSATEQUILezana AMFAN-3. Recruited by A-PAN-2 and so
close to each other that we referred to them as the "Gold Dust Twins."
Ramon was in the shipping business in Havana and eventually had to
leave. Hm lost his hore, cars, furnishings, etc. His im is now
planning to send him to Nicaragua, and I have recommended him to the
Nicaragua desk (rental) .03He has all the qualities ascribed to
Adolfo SAN FELATO (see above) except that he has never been an American
citizen. He speaks excellent English. E is dedicated, courageous and
most anxious to maintain contact with the Agency. It will be our loss
if this is not done.

6. Bernard L. Barker. AMCLATTER-1.
AMCLATTER-1. Wife: Clara. Barker is a
Cuban-American. Ex-Captain in the U.S.A.F.
Ex-Captain in the U.S.A.F. See PKQ and 20% for full
bio data. I recruited Barker in 1959, and he served faithfully until
we had to exfiltrate hir sometime in 1960. He recruited a number of
valuable agents for the Station (including AMCLATTER-5, which see) and
bed an amazing encyclopedic knowledge of Cuban persons, events and con-
tacts in all walks of life. He was a boxing manager and knew intimately
all Cubar personalities engaged in the sporting industry. He had a cuppy-
dog loyalty to his case officers and to the Agency. His biggest weakness
ms his lack of discretion. He was such a loyal American (actually if
not technically) that he would fight at the drop of a hat if anyone cast
expersions on the United States or its leaders. In the atmosphere of
Castro's Cube I might say that that was quite often. me are in the
process of helping him recover his lost American citizenship. When the
Station reopens I would certainly recommend that we continue to maintain
contact with Parker. If nothing else he would make a wonderful leg-man
for the Chief of Station. His wife is an attractive Cuian gal ɖɔ is bl-
lingual end as belligerently "American" as he is. barker, by locks and
by language, could pass either as an American or a Cubea a genuine
asset if he could be taught to submerge his americanism.

I ret Manolo through Inro ALONSOL
(now a prisoner in Cuba as a result of the 17th of April invasion).
Manolo is vorsing for us now in Miami, and I presume we have full bio
data on him. Panolo's family owned, along with Republic Steel, the big
steel plant is van which was nationalized by the Cestro_regine (Cia.
Antillana de Asoro, 3.A.). Manolo has a brother, benignos väg would
also be worth cultivating. Through his business and farily corrections
Manolo know a great many people of operational interest. One of his
friends var Devid SALVADOR, although Manolo did not share SALVADOR' #
political thinking (extras left and anti-imericks). table
