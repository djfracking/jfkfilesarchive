In addition to minerals exploitation in which Mr. William
PAWLEY has substantial investments, negotiations are being concluded
for the purchase by PAWLEY of the Hotel Hamaca in Boca Chica, a resort
town near the almost-completed new international airport, about 30 km
east of Ciudad Trujillo.
2. Another activity which is kept very much under wraps is the
concession granted PAWLEY for procurement and world-wide sale of all
new issues of Dominican postage stamps. This activity is managed by:
Edward F. PAWLEY, brother of William, whose office is in the Dominican
post office building.
