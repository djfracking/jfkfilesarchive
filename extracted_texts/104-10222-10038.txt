MEMORANDUM FOR:
SUBJECT:
Mr. Robert W. Sheay
Secretary
Clandestine Services
Career Service Board
Mr. Tennent H. Bagley
Promotion to GS-17
3 October 1966
1. Mr. Bagley was promoted to GS-16 on 6 June 1965.
At that time he was Chief, CI Group, SR Division. On
1 September 1965 he was appointed Deputy Division Chief,
SR Division. As his fitness reports attest, his perform-
ance in that position was outstanding and when in May 1966
the Soviet Bloc Division was created he was named Deputy
Division Chief of the new Division.
2. There is little that need be added to previous
fitness reports in my evaluation of Mr. Bagley's current
performance. It continues to be that of a dedicated and
gifted officer whose energies and extensive substantive
knowledge make a vital contribution to one of the top
priority programs of the Clandestine Services. Much more
important, in considering Mr. Bagley for promotion to the
next level of the supergrades, is his potential for addi-
tional growth and responsibility. He would be capable now
of taking charge of a field station, particularly one with
special opportunities for work against the Soviet Bloc and
the Chinese targets. With time (he is forty-one) he will
be capable of assuming the senior position in any division
or staff in the CS. He is clearly one of the outstanding
officers in our service.

OVER-ALL RATING

$
•
=
1. As Mr. Bagley completes approximately 42 months as
Chief of Station, Brussels, progress in Brussels
progress in Brussels remains uneven
An aggressive attack against the Soviet target has been under-
taken by a portion of the Station. Liaison has been exploited
to a degree unparalleled in other European Stations. However,
there has been a rather frustrating lack of major progress on
the part of the NOC component of the Station. While a number of
factors have contributed to these results, Mr. Bagley's style
of leadership has undoubtedly been a major one..
2.
Mr. Bagley has few peers in his ability to investigate
and define a Soviet target, and to design mechanisms capable
of assaulting this target. The research of this target under
his close supervision has been impressive, and the mechanisms
designed to support contemplated operations and to keep the
target under constant review have been functionally designed.
Some impressive achievements have resulted from these efforts
but, at the same time, overall progress has been disappointing:
A. The non-official cover component of Brussels
Station, consisting of 10 operations officers,
2 support officers and 4 other personnel, is only
now taking a 'form which would permit its effective
deployment, but its gains, in organizational
readiness are threatened by the possible loss of
leadership which, in turn, stems at least in part
from failure of Mr. Bagley clearly to delegate both
responsibility and authority to the key individuals
involved in this unit.

B. The physical divisions within the official
component of the Station have separated personnel
and files in a manner which makes close teamwork
against the target difficult. These divisions could
and should have been corrected.
C.

Mr. Bagley has not always seen eye-to-eye with
Headquarters on matters of method and emphasis, a
phenomenon which has impaired operational progress.
We accept that each Station Chief has the right --
Indeed, the duty -- to hold independent views and to
express them with integrity (as Mr. Bagley has done),
but believe that differing views could have been
resolved more easily had Station reporting to Head-
quarters been less parsimonious.

3. To sum up, Mr. Bagley's abilities to conceptualize and
to build viable models is truly outstanding, as is the exhaustively
thorough manner of his staff work; his capability to translate
his concepts into productive human ondeavor has been less
Impressive. In spite of his considerable social and diplomatic
skills, Mr. Bagley is essentially a reserved person who finds
some difficulty in communicating with his subordinates.
-
4. In spite of the problems noted, problems which we
perhaps overstress as a result of our high expectations,
Brussels Station has made good progress during this period and
Mr. Bagley's performance has been STRONG.

COMMENTS on Fitness Report on Tennent H. Bagley
1 April 1970 - 31 March 1971
:
+1
I agree with the fitness report's own suggestion that
the "problems" it noted were overstressed: its negative
content outweighs the positive by nearly three to one and is
emphasized by its format and sentence structure. Because its
overall effect belies the "Strong" rating, I believe that it
creates a misleading picture, and therefore think it necessary
to comment. Moreover, the report loaves the impression of a
general failing in two specific areas which I am sure it did
not intend to, since these are two areas which, during the
two years since the preceding fitness report, have been
repeatedly praised by Division management: 1) the level of
operational activity at this Station ("his capability to
translate his concepts into productive human endeavor has
been loss impressive") and 2) the development of a NOC
facility ("frustrating lack of major progress on the part of
the NOC component").
The report could usefully have made more precise its
implication that I have not created a satisfactory amount of
productive human endeavor by my concepts and plans. When I
took over this Station I inherited about 10 valid unilateral
assots. We have since added at least 80 new ones, of whom
about 10 romain particularly productive and promising and
at least 25 more continue to be useful, sometimes necessary,
informants or action types. Most if not all of these new
assets were spotted and recruited in direct response to my
planning and concepts. I have thus more than quintupled the
Station's assets and its capability to respond to the varied
directivos and requests it receives. The high rate of
acquisition of new assets has remained generally constant
throughout the period since the preceding fitness report.
Perhaps the current fitness report questions the "productivity"
of these assets; this is of course debatable, but can be
properly judged only in terms of our designated objectives.
We were directed to establish contact with Soviets and assess
them, with a view to their eventual recruitment. When I took
over, this Station had access of one sort or another to.
perhaps four Soviet officials; we have built to the point
where we now have contact and are providing assessments
through unilateral assets alone on nearly 40 Soviets currently
here (more, I would suspect, than any other station in the
world) not to mention some 20 other Soviets covered by liaison

OVERALL RATING
Outstanding
1. For this reporting period Mr. Bagley must be rated as
Outstanding for the achievements of his Station, achievements
in věry considerable measure due to his personal vision of how
to mount a broad attack against the Soviet target. This vision
is an unconventional one, not duplicated anywhere else in
Europe, but it is undeniably producing results in terms of an
understanding in depth of the activities of the Soviet repre-
sentation in Belgium and of the character of a number of its
individual members.
1
2. - Mr. Bagley has developed a relationship with the chief
of the principal liaison service in Belgium of such nature that
this service is for practical purposes an arm of Brussels
Station. Through this relationship, the Station is able to
exercise a large measure of control over that service's require-
ments, selection of targets and mode of operation. Needless to
say, this has been of very great help in pursuing. Agency's goals
in Belgium.
3. Although Mr. Bagley has not yet been completely success-
ful in the organization of his complement of non-official cover
personnel, his innovative approach has resulted in enormous
progress over the past year, and I have good reason to believe
that, with the implementation of certain measures which he and i
recently discussed, he will be getting much more out of his NOC
people than any other station chief in Europe.
4. I was also impressed on my most recent visit, during
the last part of April 1970,3B with what seemed to be an improved

like the shortcomings referred to in the report, are due
largely to my "style") has repeatedly been called an
innovative ground-breaking experiment. During the past year
the Division has sent COS's and officers from other stations
to Brussels to study and, presumably, to emulate applicable
parts of it. This structure was created since the preceding
fitness report, but the present one mentions only a lack of
progress" (which is moreover not defined and is not clear
even to me: What is "progress on the part of a NOC component”?)
If progress or lack of it is represented by the number of
cases turned over to NOC handling, then it is worth noting
that this Station works on the principle, not accepted every-
where, that all cases will be handled by NOC officers unless
there are overriding reasons to the contrary. So far we have
turned over some 35, another 15 turnovers are imminent, and
others are delayed only because turnover to NOC now would be
premature and potentially damaging. Since we have had to spot
BONOC
and recruit every source which could be turned over to NOC
handling, it might be forgiven that we have not yet provided
full case loads to ten active NOC officers, most of whom
arrived at about the same time a year and a half ago. We
are trying hard to produce now sources, while at the same time
reducing the excessive number of NOC officers. If "lack of
progress" monns that our experimentation with different modes
of communication, command, and administration of NOC units.
has not yot developed a final form or doctrine, the comment
is valid, but our very active experimentation continues to
identify false avenues as well as to reveal promising
perspectivos; in this we have been encouraged by the Division.
We have, also, managed to keep our NCC officers' morale quite
high (more so than elsewhere, I am told by LPGLOBE people),
have kopt them busy and productive, and have integrated them
into the Station, without loss of security, to a degree I
think unmatched elsewhere. Among the ways we have done this
are by grouping them together and delegating authority to a
NOC unit chief (although the report says that I have failed
to dolegato authority properly), and by assigning them their
own areas of operational responsibility and having them do
the Station's operational planning in those areas. This has
been productive: it has identified promising areas of
possible action which have led to recruitments, and has
eliminated less promising areas, thereby avoiding waste
motion on the part of the Station as a whole.¨
.
7
The last six lines of paragraph 2A of the fitness report
are unclear to me. If the "possible loss of leadership" of
the NOC component refers to the impending retirement of its
chief, this is manifestly not due to any failure to delegate

operations at least partly stimulated by us, and not counting
the many who have left PCS during this period. Going beyond
assessment, we have taken concrete steps toward recruitment
of a number of Soviet and Bloc officials (offers, hints,
pressures, etc., directed through our assets), we have
recruited several employees of Soviet installations in
Brussols and Antwerp, and we have made at least one significant
Bloc recruitment.
The assessments provided by our numerous assets on
large proportion of the local Soviets have permitted us to
find and to focus more realistically (i.e., with some degree
of hope) on the few promising targets We have so focussed
although, as the report says, in this there have been
differences with Headquarters on method and emphasis. But
these differences were largely a matter of semantics, and
they have not impaired operational progress: I cannot think
nor have I been told at any time, of a single specific thing
left undone against any target Soviet because of the Station'
method and emphasis.
4
In addition to our steady progress in the Soviet field,
we have so built up our local capabilities that we can and
do respond (to what I am told is an unusual degree) to
requests of other components of the CS, and in doing so we
are using largely agents recruited during my tenure and
according to my plans. We provide and backstop cover for
FE operations in the Far East; we recruit participants
for LCPIPIT organizations; we provide live addresses for other
divisions' operations; we actively support, by action and
propaganda, worldwide psych programs; we send agents, some-
times in response to book-cable requests, to fulfill
organization missions in (for example) Biafra, Saigon, the
South Sudan, Paris and Tokyo; we recruit support agents for
the use of other stations in their areas; we handle agents
in other areas on behalf of other stations; we use our assets
to spot and introduce people useful for other stations. We
do this without diminishing the rate of acquisition of new
assets directed at our primary objectives. This human
endeavor does not seem unproductive.

to him responsibility and authority; he never in his long
career had nearly as much of either as he did during my
tenure here; he retired because he reached the age of 50,
beset by family problems and facing a change in his cover job;
and this in the face of repeated and recent failures to be
promoted despite having spent more than 10 years in grade.
The report states 1), that physical divisions within the
official Station made close teamwork difficult; 2), that I
could and should have corrected them. This is erroneous on
both counts. The Station, under my direction and that of
fifteen years of my predecessors, had to occupy this allotted
space, divided because there were two different cover
organizations and not enough space in thembassy, I am not aware
that this division has significantly affected the performance
of any Station officers or programs as long as I have been
here. As to what space assignments would best promote
teamwork (i.e., who should sit where); I have given thought
to this since my first week at this Station, and am convinced
(despite musings about this or that alternative) that we have
had no choice better than the present arrangement. Most
recently, however, I have approved our part of a general
shifting of Embassy space allocations which will finally
reunify the Station after its long separation.

and has served as COS in Brussels since August 1967. His
previous assignment was as Deputy Chief, SB Division
2. The reasons for this promotion are amply covered in mỹ
fitness report of this same date. I have just returned from an
extensive trip through the European area, during which I had a
chance to see and talk with a very large number of officers
under both official and non-official cover. Pete Bagley is one.
of two whom I am recommending for promotion as a result. He is
one of our very finest station chiefs, possessed of imagination,
intellect and ability personally to handle operations which very
few of his colleagues can match. He is one of those on whom
the future of the Organization is going to depend, and I believe
that the promotion is more than justified,

NARRATIVE COMMENTS
(Attach additional sheets, if necessary for this action or for reviewing officer's comments.)
This officer is one of the few who was already here upon my arrival
at this post. From careful observation over nearly two and one
half years, with contacts several times a week, I am confirmed in
my opinion of his extremely high professional competence. Quite
naturally, I avoid delving into the details of his day-to-day operations:
However, In the area with which I am most concerned--that of his
political discretion--I have absolute confidence.]
This officer is presentable, tactful, and enthusiastic. He fits
in harmoniously with the other members of the mission, therefore
constituting an outstanding asset thereto.

NARRATIVE COMMENTS
(Atinch˜ádditional sheets, if necessary for this section or for reviewing officer's comments.)
I cannot of course comment on the professional aspects of the.
Chief CAS's performance because of the highly specialized nature of his
responsibilities.
However as a member of the Country Team I give him the highest
marks for his cooperative spirit, courtesy and willingness to contribute to
the success of our common efforts and undertakings.
Likewise I am satisfied that he maintains exceptionally close and.
effective relations with the appropriate Belgian officials.
Endowed with an unusually frank and attractive personality, the Chief
CAS is a respected and well liked member of our official American group
in Belgium, both in American and local circles, where his fluent and
excellent French is much appreciated.
His wife is a refined, quiet and attractive lady of Austrian birth.
Both have gone through an agonizingly long and grave health problem
with a young son of theirs and deserve extraordinary credit for the
courage and dignity which they constantly displayed during their ordeal:
Chief.

Since the Chief CAS reported to post in September of this year,
sufficient time has not elapsed to make a definite evaluation of his
performance. A performance evaluation covering his full period at
post will be made at the time of the next annual assessment period on
November 1, 1968. Having said this, I might add that his approach to
his job and performance to date in addition to his obvious ability and
experience have confirmed my earlier, most favorable impressions of
him.

OVERALL RATING
12
Strong
1: Mr. Bagley assumed his duties as Chief of Station on
13 September 1967. It is too early to assess the results of
his stewardship; he established in advance a timetable for
building up a structure of unilateral agent assets, and it is
not yet clear to what extent these assets are going to be
productive against major targets. However, there is no doubt
that Bagley has tackled his job with originality, energy, and
enthusiasm. A good indication of these qualities is that,
alone among our European Chiefs of Station, Bagley has himself
recruited at least half a dozen new agent assets in less than
two years.
2.
Bagley's accomplishments must be measured in light
of the fact that he has had a weak Deputy Chief of Station,
and that several of the officers in his small Station have
been of quite modest calibre. The restaffing of the Station
which is taking placo this summer should result in a con-
siderable leap forward.
3. On the personal side, Bagley has all the qualities
which we could ask for in a Chief of Station. He is totally
dedicated, incisive and articulate, a pleasant companion and
a gracious host. I rate his overall performance as Strong.

COURSE OBJECTIVES, CONTENT AND METHODS
The COS Seminar is aimed to prepare prospective Chiefs and Deputy Chiefs
of Station and Chiefs of Base for field assignments. Emphasis was upon the
difficulties confronting Chiefs of small or medium-sized installations, since
they must handle a peculiarly wide range of problems. Included were case
studios serving to remind outgoing chiefs of various operational approaches and
techniques, but more time was devoted to policy, coordination, management,
reporting, and administrative responsibilities of the Chief of Station, both within
CIA and in the government at large, at home and abroad. Special attention was
given to counterinsurgency.
The bulk of the course is given in lectures and question periodo conducted
by officials responsible for the missions, functions, programs, and services
discussed. A few key items of suggested reading are included, and bibliographies
of suggested reading tailored to the individual's assignment are offered for those
who want them.
ACHIEVEMENT RÉCORD
This is a certificate of attendance. No further assessment of individual
capacity or performance is made in this course.

Deputy Chief, SB Division, DDP
DOB 11-11-25, GS-16, SD:D
Employee Serial Number - 056043
Mr. Bagley's performance over the period continued
to be outstanding. This was his first full year as
general deputy during which he still retained responsi-
bility for a major, sensitive counterintelligence complex.
Nevertheless, during my frequent absences, Mr. Bagley
was called upon to act for me and he did so most ef-
fectively. Those aspects of his work involving decisions
on expenditures of both funds and manpower show him to be
sufficiently cost conscious yet this is tempered by a
better than average awareness of the operational value
to the Agency (or lack thereof) of such expenditures.
Mr. Bagley has been selected to become COS of a large
European station with excellent potential for Soviet Bloc
operations. In my view, this appointment is additional
testimony of the high regard in which he is held by his
professional colleagues. In recognition of his outstanding
work in SB Division, Mr. Bagley has been recommended for
promotion to GS-17.

Mr. Bagley still occupies the position described
in his last fitness report of 30 April 1964. The quality
of his performance continues to be outstanding in all
respects including cost consciousness. He has been
recommended for promotion to GS-16. This recommendation
should receive early consideration. There are certainly

very few officers in the GS-15 level who are more deserving
in terms of their executive potential and their contribu-
tions to the mission of the Clandestine Services.

From the beginning of the reporting period until
9 September 1965, Mr. Bagley continued as Chief,
Counterintelligence Group, SR Division. Mr. Bagley
was then appointed Deputy Chief, SR Division and has
remained in that position. He has served as Acting
Division Chief on several occasions including a period
of two months in 1965, when I made an extensive visit to
FE Division stations.
.
In Mr. Bagley's previous position as Chief, Counter-
intelligence Group, he completed the establishment of
this group as an effective mechanism for providing support
and direction to CS operations against the Soviet Intelli-
gence Services. His imprint can be seen in the functional
organization of the various branches of the group which
now enables us to concentrate on those aspects of KGB and
GRU operations which are essential to the comprehensive
and aggressive program we have underway to penetrate these
key Soviet targets. I have been particularly impressed
by Mr. Bagley's ability to relate the goals of these opera-
tional programs to the capabilities of his subordinates.
In fact, his appreciation of their strengths and weaknesses
enabled him to place the very best of his officers in key
positions in the CI Group where for the most part they re-
main today. Their performance is still characterized by
the high sense of discipline and professionalism imbued in
them by Mr. Bagley during his service as their chief. I
have also been struck by the spirit of loyalty permeating
this group even though Mr. Bagley's associates were often
driven at a pace which would have severely tested the
supervisor/subordinate relationship in most other units.
At the same time, he afforded the senior officers of the
CI Group every opportunity for the exercise of initiative
and imaginative leadership at their own levels. On the

BAGLEY, Tennent Hi
SECTION C (Continued)
This substantive background lends a quality of toughness and realism
to his work as a planner and supervisor which is matched by very few
others in the Clandestine Services.
As a supervisor, Mr. Bagley distinguishes himself by the ability
he has to be immensely interested in the details of his subordinates'
operations while at the same time leaving to them sufficient freedom
of decision and action to carry out their programs without undue
interference. He retains control over a large element (there are
four branches and 53 employees in the group) and several first class
senior subordinates by virtue of their respect for his competence
and substance. More important, he infuses them with the same sense
of dedication and deep enthusiasm for his work he himself possesses.
In his position Mr. Bagley also handles certain sensitive opera-
tions directly. All of the qualities of imagination, penetrating
insight, energy and protessional knowledge which can be seen in his
work as a supervisor are present in his case work. He has also
demonstrated that he is a superb agent handler with a fresh, common
sense approach to tradecraft problems. I have also seen him display
a constant readiness to sacrifice his own comfort, leisure and private
affairs to the demands of the operational situation. He is not long
discouraged in the most difficult circumstances and his natural
optimism, alert mind and special kind of clan work constantly to
discover new avenues of approach to whatever operational problems
he faces.
I would describe his cost consciousness by noting that it is
simply foreign to his nature in both a personal and professional sense
to use funds thoughtlessly. He has demonstrated that he considers
the expenditure of operational funds must, be related to a commensurate
gain in terms of our operational objectives.

other hand, he has little patience with the "time server"
who is not prepared to exert himself either to acquire
by self study the background he shouldhave to do his job
properly or if he has the background to use it effectively
in his work...
Moving into the responsibilities of deputy division
chief, Mr. Bagley has demonstrated to my satisfaction that
he was the best possible choice for this position. He
has easily mastered those substantive areas of the divi-
sion's work with which he had no previous association or
encountered only occasionally as Chief, CI Group. This
is especially true of the reports and requirements area
and of certain collection activities.
Mr. Bagley's performance in the position of deputy
chief has indeed been outstanding. I would accord him
particularly high marks for the energy and enthusiasm he
has displayed in shaping and expanding the training and
orientation programs conducted by the division as one
means of conveying to CS officers outside the division
some understanding of the Soviet target and our methods
of operating against it. Mr. Bagley continues to be sen-
sitive to costs whether one is speaking of funds. or man-
hours. lle does not lightly undertake the expenditure of
either. My very positive evaluation of Mr. Bagley's po-
tential for senior leadership in the Clandestine Service
has not changed. He is a magnificent intelligence officer
whose keen intellect and rapidly growing appreciation of the
"art of the possible" mark him as one of the best officers
in our service. It is my intention to recommend him for
promotion at an early opportunity.

over the past ten years, this is the first time he has served directly
under me.
This experience has confirmed my belief that he is without
question one of the most gifted counterintelligence officers in the
Clandestine Services. The past several months have seen many changes
in the organization of the SR Division and in its operational responsi
bilitics. It should be noted that Mr. Bagley perhaps more than any
other officer in the division contributed heavily to the broad con-
cepts and ideas which took final form in the new organization and
the operating instructions which were accepted in the Clandestine
Services as a basis for an expanded effort against the overall Soviet
target. At the same time he produced a number of specific plans and
directives portaining to the conduct of our operations against the
Soviet intelligence services. These directives are representative
of the depth of his experience in this field for they cover problems
ranging from the often neglected but absolutely essential problem of
collecting and recording data on Soviet intelligence officers to a
highly imaginative program for increasing our level of contacts with
such officers. In whatever he has undertaken in this regard, the
quality of imagination is probably the most outstanding but his work
would not be as effective as it is were it not for his amazing fund
of knowledge concerning the Soviet intelligence services, their per-
sonnel, organization and operations, and just as important, awareness
of the level and nature of the western counter intelligence effort.

Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses.demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective their relationship to
overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment
on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain ratings given in Section 8 to provide best

applicable.
Mr. Bagley is an exceptionally skilled officer in the CE field. His knowledge
of the Soviet intelligence services is almost unique in the Agency. After accomplish-
ing the assigned task of reorganizing his Branch into a streamlined and operationally
active unit, Mr. Bagley is now in the process of actively directing the planning and
implementation of an aggressive effort on a world-wide basis against the Soviet
intelligence services. Although in his present position only four months he has
shown considerable imagination and initiative. He carries out his managerial duties
in a proficient manner. He does however tend to avoid necessary but perhaps
unpromising tasks. Inclined to be intolerant of those who do not meet the high
standards he sets for himself, Mr. Bagley can be uncompromising in professional
matters to the detriment of his relationships with others.

This employee is a dedicated and hard-driving operational specialist
whose performance in the field on his last tour is well known and re-
spected in the highest Clandestine Services levels. His services were
sought after by this Division as Chief of its CI Branch. He was in-
structed to reorganize and redirect the Division's CI effort and to re-
organize the Branch into an aggressive operational unit. He has tackled
this with his characteristic aggressiveness and competence and has done
extremely well in this undertaking. He has perhaps not paid as much at-
tention to "channels and chains of command" as he should but I believe
he understands the importance of a little more tolerance along these

Chief of Station, Bern

Teniment Bailey
will be leaving Bern Station permanently, with
reassignment to Headquarters on 5 September 1982. During his four and a
half years here his performance has been highly professional and
consistently outstanding. His absence will be teruly felt by the Station,
2. Endowed with a high degree of intelligence, judgment, imagination
and operational skill, and with fluent French, German and useful Russian,
he has worked in every aspect of Station, endeavor, ranging from the proper
organization of Station records and the planning of operations to the
assessing and successful, recruiting and running of agents
3.
In his primary responsibility as Station C3 and Sovsat referent,
has made unique contributions to KUBARK's approach to and knowledge of
the field of Soviet and Polish CB, including the detection and monitoring of
RIS illegal networks, and he has played a significant role in almost every
major operation conducted by the Station over the last four years. His work
has been repeatedly commended by Headquarters,

Though

natural bent is in the field of CB, in which he
excels, he has acquitted himself equally well in other areas of Station
activity. He is particularly adroit at the analysis, planning and management
of operations and, from time to time, has_supervised all Station operational
activity with superior executive ability. His contribution to the development
of Station liaison, through inquiries, follow-ups and special studies prepared
tɔ stimulate the local service to action in URAX's behalf, has been
indispensable and unquestionably an important factor in the growth of Swiss-
KUMARK Liaison.

Subject is a thoroughly professional intelligence officer endowed with a high

degree of intelligence and ability to concentrate. He is imaginative and skilled. A
rapid,. accurate and purposeful worker, he is a good write mandang articulate speaker.
Though his natural bent is in the CE field, in which he excels, he has also demon-
strated ability and accomplishments in other areas of Station activity. He is par-
ticularly adroit at the analysis, planning and management of his operations. His
contribution to the Station liaison take (through inquiries, follow-up and special studies
he has prepared to stimulate liaison to action in KUBARK's behalf) has been out--
standing and has been a vital factor in stepping up the pace of Swiss-KUBARK Haison.
Subject tends at times to avoid necessary but unpromising Station chores and at times
is intolerant of those who do not meet the very high standards he sets for himself.
These are minor flaws in an otherwise superior officer with outstanding potential.

1. Subject is an exceptionally strong Case Officer in terms of initiative,
imagination and skill. His greatest assets are a thorough understanding
of intelligence techniques, native intelligence and the ability to apply
both to operational situations. He is a rapid, accurate and purposeful
worker with unusual powers of concentration, a good writer and articulate
speaker. Although reasonably versatile, he has become a specialist in
the CE field, for which he seems particularly well suited by natural
talent and personality. Most of his work in his current position has
required analysis, coordination and "desk" management of operations
rather than actual agent handling and his performance in dealing with
some fairly complex operational situations has been superior in every
respect. He has used his
cover intelligently.
State Dept
2. By virtue of his intellectual capacity and intense interest in his work,
Subject's potential for further development must be rated high. However,
he should attempt to bring more flexibility and understanding into his
relations with others. His views tend to be very positive and sometimes
are argued with more vigor than tact. These are minor weaknesses in
an otherwise exceptionally promising officer.

3. NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF MANNER OF JOB PERFORMANCE
DIRECTIONS. Stress strengths and weaknesses, particularly those which affect development on present job.
The high ratings given Mr. Bagley are given in full consciousness of their uniqueness
in this Division. Mr. Bagley's all-around competence, his professional integrity,
devotion to duty, his thorough grasp of clandestine operations and particularly his
comprehension of CS matters and Soviet and Satellite intelligence services are of the
highest order and, in my opinion, therefore deserve this type of recognition.
Mr. Bagley can be impatient with the less gifted, intolerant of bureaucratic necessi-
ties, or uncompromising in professional matters. These traits are listed here not to
detract from his professional competence or personal qualities, but to inlicate that
his supervisory talents are not yet fully developed. Mr. Bagley speaks fluent French
and German.

Mr. Bagley's potential agua Clandestine Services operation officer is limited only
by his relative youth and symptoms such as occasional impatience and doggedness.
His intellectual gifts and professional competen & beyond question and qualify
him for any operational job within DD/P in due course.
SECTION N.
FUTURE PLANS

reporter with outstanding memory and 'analytic facilities. A perceptive and alert
case officer. Works hard, writes well and easily. Keeps on top of his work and
-reporting to an unusual degree. Adapts casily to overseas life and has considerable
cham and social presence. Speaks very useful German and fluent French.
B. WHAT ARE HIS OUTSTANDING WEAKNESSEST
Lack of team spirit.
Impatience with the less gifted. Difficulty delegating responsi
bility. These wealnesses add up to a certain intellectual and social snobbery which
could, if continued, unnecessarily restrict Subj's horizons in the broadest aspects of
possible future assignments. They will have little effect on his operational brilliand
but will not enhance his ability to pass on his experience to others, or to supervice
and guide them. Experience over the last couple of years indicates that he will need
assistance in, this and his failings, miner tho they may be, should regularly be brought

2. Subject's weaknesses, which because of his outstanding ability and
promise are rather magnified in this assessment, lie mainly in his occasionally
faulty human relations. Subject rejects much of the social life which is
customarily associated (although not necessarily for the best) with Kubark
field posts. His interests, aside from his work, are primarily intellectual
and artistic. These interests, coupled with his at best pro forma fulfilling
of the customary Kubark social protocols, definitely weaken his relationship
with the rest of the staff™
3. Subject comes from à service environment and was himself a Marine
officer when very young. This early environment and training has, probably without
Subject's being aware of it, caused him to expect of others a devotion to duty:
and self discipline which is rarely to be found. These high standards have
caused Subject to discount to some degree the abilities of the clerical staff
and, to a lesser degree, other junior personnel.
4. A second weakness probably results from Subject's consistently success-
ful career. He has, without any effort on his own part, frequently if not
invariably found himself closely associated with management" and regarded by
the "management" as being unusually talented. This has caused him to expect
his work to receive special attention which is not always warranted. When this
does not happen, he tends to pout.
5. There is no question in the writer's mind but what Subject would be
an outstanding addition to any office in the Agency. He has, as far as can be
seen now, an unlimited growth potential. His minor faults will correct them-
selves with maturity and increasing experience.

A chment to EAVA-4351
KAPOK
:
23 September 1953
1. Subject has completed a two-year tour at VOB and after home leave
has returned here for another two years. Initially assigned to VOB under
Embassy cover, Subject has now transferred to D/A civilian cover. Since
his arrival in Vienna, Subject has come through a rather long apprenticeship
wherein he was exposed to a variety of intelligence problems, including the
organization of counter-intelligence files, the handling of two American deep
cover agents, the training and mounting of an Hungarian border crosser, and
the direction of an Austrian double agent. At this time, Subject is head of
the Mission CE section. He has organized that section efficiently and has
arranged the expeditious handling of routine CI problems. He is now prepared
to undertake more creative CE work.
2. Subject has a notably orderly mind, unusual intelligence, and a re-
markable interest in his work. He is able to handle a variety of tasks at
one time. Although Subject has had a variety of agent-handling experience,
unfortunately, he has not had the opportunity to handle many agents. We intend
to correct this in the next few months by having him handle a series of opera-
tions during the developmental stages. We believe this will give him the
experience and depth necessary to support his already good theoretical knowledge.
Subject is extremely well disciplined personally. Unfortunately and unrealis-
tically, he sometimes expects other persons to have similar self-discipline.
He also tends in other ways to disregard the human elements ever présent in
intelligence operations. However, there is no question in my mind but that
additional experience will cure both of these very minor faults.
3. I have every reason to believe that Subject will be ready for important
operational assignments either in Washington or in the field after another two
years of field experience.

MEMORANDUM FOR:
SUBJECT:
Mr. Robert W. Sheay
Secretary
Clandestine Services
Career Service Board
Tennent H. Bagley.
Promotion to GS-16
;
1. Mr. Bagley is without question among the best?
qualified of the senior officers in SR Division and is
also one of the most competent counterespionage officers in
the Clandestine Services as a whole. Few have had his prep-
aration or his experience in the Soviet Bloc aspects of
this field. After entering on duty in 1950 he was assigned
to the Vienna Station where for five years he worked directly
on operations against the Soviet intelligence elements con-
centrated there. When he returned to Headquarters, he
supervised the CE Section of the Polish Branch, EE Division
when a combination of defectors and penetrations of the
Polish services made this job one of the most demanding
of any in the Clandestine Services. In his next overseas
assignment in Switzerland, he evolved techniques of opera-
tional analysis of Soviet intelligence residencies which
form the backbone of the system we are using today. While
in this post he participated in an operation involving a
major penetration of the Polish intelligence service which
also had enormous significance for our efforts against the
Soviets. Just prior to his departure from Switzerland, he
handled one of the most complex and challenging Soviet CE
operations ever encountered by our service.
2. In 1962 he was appointed Chief of SR Division's
CE element. Under his direction the CE effort of the
Division took on entirely new dimensions. Because of Mr.
Bagley's marvelous, combination of CS experience, substantive
knowledge and enthusiasm, the SR/CI Group has become one
of the most effective and highly motivated units in the
Division. The Group has developed a high level of sub-
stantive specialization which it applies to CS coverage
of the Soviet intelligence services throughout the world.
At the same time, a large percentage of the Group's best
officers have been committed full time to a special opera-
tion of great value and significance. The ability of

SR/CI to absorb this workload stems not only from Mr.
Bagley's capacity for professional guidance but his ef-
fectiveness in leading and inspiring those under him.
3. Mr. Bagley's record to date reveals a high degree
of specialization in counterespionage yet it would be mis-
leading indeed to conclude that his professional interests
and potential are confined to this field. His contribu-
tions to the broader problems of Soviet operations have
been invaluable particularly in the way in which he has
suggested new techniques for attacking the Soviet target
abroad.
4.
'
I consider Mr. Bagley an outstanding officer to
whom the Clandestine Services will turn for the exercise of
still greater responsibilities in the future. He is fully
qualified for promotion to GS-16. I urge that he be promoted
now in recognition of the work he has done so far and the
potential he possesses for a productive cárcer at the top
level of Clandestine Services officers.

Chief, CI Branch, SR Division
DODS-Sponsored Orientation Program
for Contact Division Field Officers
I wish to express my appreciation for your partici–
pation in our training program at Warrenton from 23-27
September 1963. On balance, this program, which was
designed to familiarize 00/CD personnel with the general
mission of the Clandestine Services and the particular
problems of DODS, went very well.
-
Your presentation stood out as one of the highlights
of the program and received unanimous commendation from
the 00/CD officer-trainees. Your able exposition on a most
important subject contributed heavily to the success of
the program and is indeed much appreciated.

Subject joined KUBARK in July 1950. He was given the Staff Orientation
and the Basic and Advanced Operations courses prior to his arrival at VOB in June
1951. After a period of agent handling and technical work in the operations, support
feld, Subject was made Chief of the Counter Espionage Section for the Mission in
November 1952, a position which he has held until his very recent roassignment to
the Soviet Section. Following Home Leave, ho began his second tour here in September
1953. Subject joined the Mission as a 5-9, was promoted to 05-11 on 26 April 1953.
"
2. Subject was given a rather long apprenticeship in Vienna before he was
called upon to set up the CE Section. During this orientation period he was exposed
to a variety of intelligence problems, including technical surveillance, photography,
secret writing, and documentation, the handling of the American deep cover agents,
the training and mounting of an Hungarian border cresser, and the direction of an
Austrian double agent. As Chief of the Counter Espionage Section, Subject's res-
ponsibilities included the supervision and training of its personnel, the direction
and coordination of its activities, and the setting up of procedures for namechecking,
carding, file research, and the raintenance of CE and central personality files.

and his ability to obtain results have been outstanding attributes in his per-
formance here, and have resulted in his becoming theremely familiar with the Ca
problem in Austria. He has done exceptionally well on a variety of operations,
giving each of his cases a maximum amount of planning, and demonstrating an unusual
grasp for details. He has read widely in case files, and now possesses a better

of German, which he has learned from scratch here, and be has built up a recáriable
knowledge of this area. He was quick to learn the techniques of basic tradecraf
which had enabled him to teach junior case officers and to instruct in the trades
craft seminars held at VOB. His staff guidance in certain double agent cases” has
increased considerably their value to this Hission. written reports turned in by
Subject have been excellent, displaying forcefulness, fluency, and lucidity, as.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Retirement.
-
Tennent H. Bagley
30 June 1972
1. The retirement of Subject, effected as a result of a
memorandum from the Head of his Career Service stating that
he is surplus to the needs of the Service and that his retirement
will be recommended to the Director under the provisions of the
. CIA Retirement and Disability System pertaining to involuntary
retirement, in no way implies an adverse action. Subject signed
an application for retirement of his own volition in order to
qualify for an immediate retirement annuity. The liberalized
criteria for such separations was established by the Agency to
parallel similar actions under the Civil Service Retirement
System in accordance with FPM Letter No. 831-23, dated
10 December 1969.
2. Any inquiry received concerning the nature of the
separation of Subject from the Agency should be confirmed simply
as a retirement.

-MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
The request of Tennent Harrington Bagley for permission to remain
employed by this Agency after marriage is approved subject to the followings
1. Subject's immediate supervisor will be notified by cable
counsel with subject regarding the serious effect the marriage
will have in impairing what otherwise appears to be an outstanding
career with this Agency. Subject, although young has demonstrated
exceptional ability and great promise and has been promoted well
ahead of others of his age bracket. Based upon his actions to
date, it would appear subject might ultimately expect to attain
a position of considerable importance and responsibility in this.
Agency, if no inherent limitations develop. The proposed marriage
places such a limitation on the use of subject, not only in
particular parts of Europe, but in Headquarters as well. Certain
clearances required of high level employees of the Agency will
be difficult to obtain if this marriage to contracted, and
the limitations on the type of assignments which will be available
to him will not enhance his career development.
=
2. After receiving this counsel and giving it consideration,
if subject continues in his desire to marry and contracts the
marriage, he will be removed from Austria as soon as he can
conveniently arrange for his spouse's viss. Following the
marriage, he shall be withdrawn from the wore sensitive elements
of the Station's business.

KAPOK
Subject Joined KULARK in July 1950. He was given the Staff Orientation,
and the Basic and Advanced Operations courses prior to his arrival at VOB in June
1951. After a period of agent handling and technical work in the operations suppor
field, Subject was made Chief of the Counter Fspionage Section for the Mission in
November 1952, a position which he has held until his very recent reassignment to:
the Boviet Section. Following Home Leave, he began his second tour here in September
1953. Subject joined the Mission as a 8-9, wao promoted to -11 on 26 April 1953.
M
2. Subject was given a rather long apprenticeship in Vienna before he was
called upon to set up the CE Section. During this orientation period he was exposed
to a variety of intelligence problems, including technical surveillance, photography,
secret writing, and documentation, the handling of two American deep cover agents,
the training and mounting of an Hungarian border crosser, and the direction of an
Austrian double agent. As Chief of the Counter Espionago Section, Subject's res-
ponsibilities included the supervision and training of its personnel, the direction
and coordination of its activities, and the setting up of procedures for namechecking,
carding, file research, and the maintenance of CE and central personality files.
Subject was personally responsible for CE analysis as directed by the Chief of
Operations. Subject's activity has been restricted to the Soviet CF picture, which
we consider a major operational effort of this Mission.
"
3. Subject's interest and enthusiasm in his work, his attention to duty,
and his ability to obtain resulta have been cutstanding attributes in his per-
formance here, and have resulted in his becoming thoroughly familiar with the CE
praw in Austria. He has done exceptionally well on a variety of operations,
mnt of planning, and demonstrating an unusual
grasp for details. He has read widely in case files, and now possesses a botter
than average counter-intelligence background. Subject has a good working knowledge
of German, which he has learned from scratch here, and he has built up a remarkable
knowledge of this area. He was quick to learn the techniques of basic tradecraft,
which had enabled him to teach junior caño officers and to instruct in the trade-
craft seminars hold at VOB. His staff guidance in certè double agent cases has
increased considerably their value to this Mission. Written roports turned in by
Subject have been excellent, displaying forcefulness, fluency, and lucidity, as
well as the rasential brevity. He has a forceful personality and la usually
successful in agent handling.

SUBJECT
1.
Secretary, CSCS Board
Recommendation for Promotion to GS-17 -
Mr. Tennant H. Bagley
It is recommended that Mr. Tennent H. Bagley be pro-
moted to GS-17. He has been in grade as GS-16 since June 1965
and has served as COS in Brussels since August 1967. His
previous assignment was as Deputy Chief, SB Division.
2. The reasons for this promotion are amply covered in my
fitness report of this same date. I have just returned from an
extensive trip through the European area, during which I had a
chance to see and talk with a very large number of officers
under both official and non-official cover.
non-official cover. Pete Bagley is one
of two whom I am recommending for promotion as a result. Ee is
one of our very finest station chiefs, possessed of imagination,
intellect and ability personally to handle operations which very
few of his colleagues can match. He is one of those on whom
the future of the Organization is going to depend, and I believe
that the promotion is more than justified.

:
the key officers responsible for the direction and control of
some of the most sensitive operations then boing conducted by
the Clandestine Services. lle carried out his responsibilities
with skill and discretion, and the ability to stand up under
repeated periods of heavy pressure.
In recognition of his excellent service as Doputy Chief
SR, Mr. Bagley in March 1967 was assigned as Chief of Station,
Brussels, a major target area of Soviet espionage due to the
presence of NATO and European Community lloadquarters.
In the past five years as Chief of Station, Brussels,
Mr. Bagley has been an effective Station, Chief who has been
particularly successful in the field of liaison. He
established a unique relationship with the Chief of the
Belgian Internal Security Service which has greatly facilli
tated the over-all operational activities of the Brussels
Station. This relationship successfully underwent its
strongest test at the time of the defection of a GRU officer
in Brussels in October 1971 and the subsequent worldwide
propaganda exploitation of his disclosures.
Under Mr. Bagley's direction Brussels Station has
concentrated heavily on the Soviet target and has been a
major tost area for the non-official cover concept for
operations.
Mr. Bagley's entire career has been characterized by
the consistent excellence of his performance in each assign=
ment of increasing responsibilities that he has undertaken.
He is recognized as one of the top Soviet operations
specialists in the Clandestine Service and has spent the
bulk of his twenty-two year career working in the most.
sensitive and complex areas of intelligence work. We regret
his decision to retire for personal reasons and the loss of
his experience and expertise to the Clandestine Service. It
is strongly recommended that in recognition of his outstanding
service to the Clandestine Service in positions of critical
and demanding responsibility Mr. Tonnont H. Bagley be awarded.
the Intelligence Medal of Merit.
