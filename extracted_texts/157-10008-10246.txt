INTERVIEW AND MEETING SUMMARY
TOP SECRET
Prepared a daily briefing for the White
House on Cuban intelligence.
Preparing review of books such as "The
Invisible Government" and damage reports
(i.e., reports setting forth what sensitive
information exposed by book).
P.D. stressed that he was "out of touch with the
day-to-day operations of Task Force W". However,
he believes that Harvey kept Helms fully briefed.
Harvey, in P.D.'s own words, was "not an
ordinary man",
"egocentric", "bombastic",
"one of the strongest proponents of compartmentali-
zation and need to know". In addition, Harvey had
a law degree and a successful FBI stint prior to
joining the Agency.
In
Harvey had a thyroid problem. As one of the
"CIA's most interesting characters", Harvey was
often talked about; P.D. has difficulty separating
personal experience from rumors. Describing
Harvey as a "four martini man at lunch"
which, coupled with Harvey's thyroid medicine,
caused Harvey to be sleepy, etc., after lunch.
fact, P.D. told us that this was the "last straw"
in McCone's eyes; i.e., apparently when McCone
called Harvey in to "discuss" the Kennedys' com-
plaints about Harvey's utterings, it was immediately
after lunch and Harvey either fell asleep or failed
to pay attention. ("McCone did not have an audience.
P.D. added that there was general "bad chemistry"
between McCone and Harvey.
P.D. noted Harvey's intense loyalty to "his people"
(including Helms and Starkey However, P.D.
is sure that even with these people, Harvey was
likely to have been extremely close-mouthed.
