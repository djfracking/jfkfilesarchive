Dear Mr. Sternberg:
As you might surmise, your organization is well
known to the Agency. Following the receipt of your
letter of 31 March 1976, a more definitive search for
information pertaining to your request was conducted.
No information was located which would indicate that
CIA has ever provided funds to the IRC either directly
or indirectly. I trust this letter will allay any
apprehensions your organization has had in this
matter.
If I can be of further assistance, do not
hesitate to contact me.
☐ Sincerely,
George Bush

IRC representative, who stated he would supply as much
of the information desired as possible without cost.
The project was closed as of 31 August 1950.
1 3. In November 1950, David Martin, Executive
Secretary of the IRC met with George Carey, Assistant
Director for Operations, with as many as five proposals
for collaboration between CIA and IRC. One proposal was
for the support of a European Institute which would pro-
vide employment for displaced scientists, journalists,
etc. He was informed that CIA had no funds for financing..

of a scientific institute rather than Agency employees.

we should wait a few weeks or months until the new arrival has settled down,

SUBJECT: Call from Jack Cogswell, 22 March 1971
5564
B5-5564
Cogswell telephoned to inform that the International Rescue
Committée planned to hold a Press Conference on 24 March 1971 in New
York to discuss prisoners in Cuban jails. Cogswell voiced the hope
that the conference would not have any adverse effects on attempts
underway to obtain the release of Lawrence Kirby Lunt from a Cuban
prison. He explained that "Pancho" ("who is known to your people, I
am sure") is on his way to Mexico City with $3,500. He will contact a
woman there who apparently knows who to pay off to arrange Lunt's
release. Cogswell indicated that "they" hoped to pay no more than
$10,000.

1. Om 6 Jun 69 Deputy Chief, NYFO, accompanied by C/S Elliff,

2. When we opened the discussion with the statement that we
had heard indirectly that the question of cooperation with the CIA had
arisen at the ACVA meeting, Cummings immediately stated that this was
indeed the case, and for his part, he wished to have no contact at all
with our Agency. Invited to elaborate on his reasons, Cummings said.it

Res-

the refugee be given a telephone number to call after his arrival.

the FBI in a different light and would not deny its agents information

the contrary, in response to our direct question, Cummings said that
his objections were those of principle rather than of manner of approach
by the NYFO. At no time during our conversation with him did he make
any objection to the procedure set up between him and C/S Elliff to
facilitate the acquiring of the information we requested. We do not have
any doubts that Cummings did indeed make the statements attributed to him
in reference memo, but it is at least interesting that he specifically
refuted them in our presence. After displaying nothing but hostility
toward the Agency, during cur entire meeting, he invited us to call upon
him in the future if he "could ever do anything for us personally.
Obviously we do not expect to contact him on any basis in the future and
we are certain that he does not anticipate further inquiries from this.

flux of refugees. As can be seen from the memo, Cummings
was cooperative and, in fact, offered more assistance to us
than we later requested. We spoke on the telephone with
Cummings a few weeks later to say that, in all likelihood,

conversations which were held in my presence by certain:
voluntary agency representatives with regard to CIA

(1) On May 5, after concluding my own business dis-
cussions, Dr. Jan Papanek, President of the American Fund
expressed his deep con-
for Czechoslovak Refugees, Inc.
cern over being asked to supply information on the where-
abouts of his former countrymen. Dr. Papanek told me that
the CIA is checking on a large number of Czech refugees,
most of whom have no special experience or qualifications
which would seem to be of particular interest to the United
States.. He knows that many of these people are being sub-
jected to intensive interrogations which bewilder and
frighten them. The procedure was initiated last October by
a CIA man who identified himself as Norman N. Graber.
Dr. Papanek receives his requests by letter (he showed me
one sample) which simply lists the names and other basic:
data, either immigration number or date of birth.
return address used by the CIA is P.O. Box 1294 in Grand
Central Station, to which Dr. Papanek is to send his reply
that is, the latest U.S. address recorded in his files.
Dr. Papanek did not mention a specific number of names
or requests but he said they are growing and he is very
uncomfortable about it; he does not want his good name or

If this information is essential to U.S. interests,

(2) On May 6, after concluding my work with 5.4/16
Mr. Edmund Cummings, Associate Director of the U.S.
Catholic Conference, the question again came up.
Mr. Cummings expressed his agitation over the seemingly
amateurish and scattershot method by which the CIA is
operating in this field. He also questioned the value of
interrogating simple refugees who are not defectors with
Mr. Cummings said.
special qualifications or background.
the groundwork was laid sometime ago (no date mentioned)
by a female officer of the CIA, and that he agreed to the
exchange of mail procedure utilizing the P.O. Box at
Grand Central. However, he has become concerned over the
numbers and types of requests. He suggested, as did
Dr. Papanek, that INS might be the proper contact point
for CIA. Mr. Cummings also mentioned that the FBI agents
appear in person and he indicated that their approach
seems more professional.

(3) I was also informed by Mr. Cummings that the
International Rescue Committee, Inc., whose Executive
Director is Mr. Charles Sternberg, was somewhat alarmed
by the same situation. Thad previously consulted
Mr. Sternberg on my own project but he did not raise the
CIA matter with me.

of the Committee on Migration and Refugee Problems,

been in touch" "with Washington" at the appropriate level
implying that the Council should at least table the matter
for the time being. Mr. Cummings then moved that (a) there
would be no further discussion of it, and (b) each volun-

1. Dr. Edgar Lowell, a contact of ours at the John Tracy.
Clinic, 806. W. Ariams blvd., Los Angeles 7, California, where a
great deal of electronic research is carried on concerning deaf-
ness, has advised us that he has been nominated as the Program
Chairman for the International Congress on Education of the Deaf,
The host for this Conference will

be the Council on Education of the Deaf and the Congress will be hold
at Gallaudet College, Washington, D.C. The Coordinater for this
International Congress will be Dr. Powrie V. Doctor of Gallaudet
College, who will be working with the State Department on this par-
ticular Congress.
LS 5564 A-10.0782

2. As Chairman of the Program Committee, Dr. Lowell will be
required to go to Europe to attend a meeting of a similar European
group planning their annual congress for about the same time, and
will visit Italy, France, Belgium, Germany, England and Scandinavia
to check on attendees. There is a possibility that he will also go
to Yugoslavia at the same time.
3. As a side-line it is also possible that Dr. Lowell will go
to Moscow where he will visit Prof. E.N. Sokolov, Institute of Do-
fectology, Pogodina Str 8, Hoscow G-117, USSR. Prof. Sokolov is
well-known and has been active in previous Macey Conferences in

ported through Dr. Lovell on both Sokolov and Prof. A. R. Luriya,
and continuing correspondence between Sokolov and Dr. Lowell has
also been reported.
4. The Soviets will be invited to this Congress and if the
present cordial relationship still exists unaltered by world events,
no doubt Sokolov and/or others will certainly be interested if not
attend this meeting.

information on Hungary to Mr. David Martin of the International

Dear Mr. MacCracken:
I thought you would like to know that the International Rescus
Committee has organised a Commission of distinguished Americans
who will visit Europe to investigate the refugee situation and
iams a report on their return. de envision that the Courdission's
report would highlight the following factors.
A
1. The conditions and needs of those Forgotten Mon who
have been sitting in refuge camps for years or who
are inadequately resettled outside of camps.
portion of the report will be devoted to the Hungarian
refugees who are still in campo.
2. Make specific and general recommendations as to what
can be done in the future to meet the needs of the
"Forgotten Hea",
Aside from highlighting the factors just mentioned, wo feel that
the Commission's report can surve, among others, the following
constructive purposes.
1. By dramatising and humanizing the problems of
European Escapees, we believe that the Commission
can help to create a climate of public opinion
confucive to :
2.
More generous support for U.S. programa
concorned with the refugees, both private
and governmental.
b. More flexible imigration legislation.
The report of the commission will, of course, incorporato
information from the survey now being prepared by the UNHCR,
Indeed, we feel that the Commission can be of great assist
ance to the UCH by bringing his revert and the refuges
situation in general to the attention of the American
.

2. A usually reliable source reported in September 1951 that Bubject,
then the director of the office of the High Commissioner for Refugees and
an official at the British Foreign Office, accompanied the High Commissioner

Subject was not at all tactful in his dealings with Italian officials and
thus he met passive resistance. Furthermore, acting on behalf of the
Commissioner and very eager to put at once as many British agents as possible
into positions under the Commissioner's cover, Subject appointed Marual
DE MAR, Chairman of the International Refugee Organization (IRO) Review
Board, to the position of representative in Italy. According to Source,
this annoyed Prince DEL DRAGO, Italian envoy to IRD in Genova, Bwitserland,
who stated that as long as IRO was functioning, there would be no other
refugee representative working in Italy and that, after all, the Commissioner
had to be first recognised by the Government. DE BEAR was said to be "peracus

3. According to a report dated 7 January 1954 from a fairly reliable
source, it had been reported by various sub-sources that John ALEXARTER,
British, Delegate to Italy of the High Commissioner of the United Eations
for Refugees, was a person to be considered rather politically dubious.
According to Source, on several occasions he had been excessively interested
in favoring foreigners in Italy who had received expulsion notices as a
result of their commercial activity and political contacts with Iron Curtain
countrieв. Source stated that Subject vas further reported to te on very
friendly terms with Italians and non-Italians who were clearly orientedi

Our contact in the Harold Oran Agency public relations office advises.
that a Mr. Rufus Philips who is connected with psychological warfare
activities of the Agency, has been in contact with Oram and his agency
for the purpose of arranging distribution of a film which was made in
Vietnam and is concerned with the communist methods of operating in an
agrarian community. Phillips was formerly in Vietnam under cover.
Our contact further advises that one John Gates, a former member of
CIA in the Saigon station, was used by Oram as the narrator for the
movie at a recent private showing. This same John Gates is reported
by our contact to be extremely indiscreet insofar as security matters
are concerned. Our contact is somewhat concerned that Gates will
inadvertently reveal that he. (Peter white) was connected with CIA
while he was in Vietnam. Peter's experience with Gates' indescretion
dates back to his visit in Vietnam at which time Gates told his girl
friend about what Peter was doing. (This has been previously reported.).

The film in question which now bears the title "The Fire and the Shadow"
was in part or wholly financed by CIA. The Oram Agency has arranged
distribution for showings in Formosa and Korea. The Oram Agency has
had professional movie makers take a look at it for possible showing
in the US. The professionals were highly critical and completely
discouraged any attempt to have it distributed in the US.
We assume that Headquarters 00/C was not advised of this out of channels
approach since the NYFO had not received any word of same. As you know
Harold Oram and his Agency has been a contact of the HYFO for many
years.

attached merio had previously been received from OCR as an USIA requirement.
On the latter we told OCR (Sturbits) that since the names of the people
given were not their correct name wo could not take action on the requiremont
since we need the right names to get an FBI clearance. USIA later told OCR
to consider the requirement withdrawn and USIA would contact the tree people.
I told migel's office of the USIA business and suggested that they contact
USIA since it would look bad for all of us to be contacting the xLTE

The Turning Point
On June 17th, 1933 one of the most
took
significant events of the 20th century
place. The inhabitants of the Soviet Zone of
Germany rose in rebellion against their
Communist overlords. For eight years they
had been lising under conditions of slavery
and starvation.
The insurrection began in East Berlin on
| June 16th. It was begun initially by a few
workers but within hours it had spread to
every level of the population. By the 17th
of June the uprising had spread throughout
the East Zone a completely unorganized,
spontaneous revolt,
At 11:00 o'clock the morning of June.
16th the workers in block 10, Stalin Allee,
decided to organize a demonstration to pro-
test the raising of the work norm by the
regime. By 2:00 o'clock that same after-
noon, the mob of people which had grown
from 200 to over 20,000 became revolu.
tionaries. Surging in front of the East Zone
Government building in East Berlin, they
demanded not only the lifting of the norms
but free secret elections, the unification of
Germany and the abdication of the East
German government,
The stories contained here are the stories
of a few of those brave men and women
from East Germany who played leading
roles in the revolt and had to flee to the
West. They are representative, of 4,000
leaders, many of whom have subsequently
been sentenced to death by Communist
courts. Some were intellectuals and profes
sionals. Most of them were workmen: All
are men who deserve the undying gratitude
and support of free men everywhere.

"When the work norms were increased the

that had made us so cautious gradually began
to dissolve. There was, after all, little more
to lose.

"There were only twenty in my group as we

Berlin were on strike. Although we knew that
strikes in the Communist Zone were consid-

years in prison, we marched on with a feeling
of exhilaration. As we strode along we beck-

At Magdeburg
A BAND LEADER
iNs Herzberg, band lender at the city the
H
atre, was the strike leader under whose guid
once the FDJ (Communist Youth Movement
offer. Communist Party Headquarters and the
home of the Chief Commissioner of Police
were stormed. No event of the day impressed
Hens as much as the occurrence at Magdeburg
station)
"After we disarmed the Vopos (People's
Police) on duty at the station, we tore down
the bated Passage of Interzone-Dispatching
Sign.” As though this in itself could accomplish
the task, the crowd began shouting. “There are
no borders anymore."
~As the interzonal train arrived in the sta
tion. the frightened-passengers locked the
doors and windows, fearing an attack by Com-
munist soldiers and police. As soon as they saw
our sign "The SED is beaten," the windows and
doors were opened and the people burst ont,
embracing each other, shouting, crying and
some even giving away their possessions in
celebration, assuming that the union of the
East and West was an accomplished fact.
-We asked them to spread the word along
on their way to Berlin. At this time we still
thought that rebellions were taking place only
in Magdeburg and Berlin. We were jubilant a
few hours later when we learned from RIAS
(Voice of America) and NWDR (West Berlit
station) that uprisings were occurring all over
East Germany.
The next train to arrive contained a pris
oæer car. After a few tense moments we man
aged to gain control of the train and get the
14-year-
ceils open. One of the prisoners was a year
old farmer who was imprisoned a year beföre
because hiç, had not been able to meet his
quota. He was speechless with fright and dis-
belief. When he was finally convinced that he
was a free man, he broke down and wept, over-
come with joy. I had to carry him away.".
Prisoners Are Freed
A LOCKSMITH
WERNER MENGELSDORF is a locksmith. He led
the heroic liberation of 80 political prisoners
in Magdeburg.)
"A mob 3,000 strong stormed into the court-
yard of the prison in Magdeburg. The prison.
ers pressed their worn, pale faces against the
bars. A woman in the crowd started to scream
as she recognized her husband who had been
arrested only two days before.
“The wooden doors of the prison splintered
under the weight of the surging crowd. The
guards fled. The metal door to the cell block
was pried open. Mengelsdorf called for the
locksmiths and together they opened the cell
doors. Indescribable scenes followed. One
prisoner cried, Freedom! Freedom!", then
fell to the floor crying. A young man sen-
tenced to 25 years for crimes against the state
stepped out of his cell into the arms of the girl
to' whom he had been engaged. Neither knew
the other was there until the doors opened.
They embraced, wordless.
“Soviet tanks rumbled into the prison yard
before all the prisoners could be released.
Mangelsdorf himself barely escaped with his
life. His only route of escape lay in swimming
the Landwehreanal which separates East and
West Berlin at certain spots. He waited until
dark and then made it. narrowly escaping
death from Soviet bullets which peppered the
water around him. He is today in one of the
camps in West Berlin, destitute but resolved
that one day will come when all of East Ger-
many as well as the satellite countries will
again be free."

I have just returned from Berlin. I am reporting to you as
one of many observers who are agreed that the weaponless men and women
of Eastern Germany stand as the first line of defense between us and
the tyranny of Soviet Power. The entire world is now aware of what has

But do you know why this most remarkable revolution occurred
how these people just like the young couple next door, the truck
driver down the street, the band leader - have been able to rebel
against overwhelming odds? It is not only out of sheer desperation
because of the insufferable conditions-under which they have been
living. People in the other satellites are suffering. These are
people who are desperately weary of tyrants of all political shades

Dear Abet
I am sorry that I must bother you with my personal problems, but since I don't
know what to do under the present circumstances I am begging you for understanding.
As you know I always had trouble with the other side". If somebody works in this
field he must be endangered after a certain time. I believe. I told you about the
calls in Russian and about the spies who are constantly around me since about 1951.
I am used always to be on the alert and to look around me carefully, this is the
only thing I can do. In addition to that I bought a dog in the summer of last year.

I sell my dog I would not be able to buy the new one, because they are terribly

anymore. I can move from one of my friends to the other for a certain time but

I not only feel endangered but I have knowledge of their intentions and I am

all of the points which were sped to be obtained by the formation of entity 1,
and since this will constitute obviously undesirable cyplication of effect,
approximately ton of the strive leaders' indicated that they would giro their
support to CAIDI? or other existing onsalations rather than to the new troup.
(The German language report of the CALDIT meeting is forwarded unuar separate

5. On 21 July 1957, a special meeting of various west Berlin government and realis-
tance group representatives was called to discuss the feasibility, and desirability
of encouraging the formation of Identity 1. with few excepti
with few exceptions, all of the major
organisations expressed the view outlined in paragraph 3 avo.
was officially voiced that the members of Identity 1 should lend their support to
existing organisations. (A German language report of this meeting powpared by the
CAIROIT representative is forwarded under separate cover as Attachment *P)
6. On 12 August 1953, a monting was called by HICOG-EAD of representatives of U.s.
intelligence organisations in Berlin. The purpose of this mosting was to discuss
the possibility that the formation of Identity 1 night constitute a throat to the
security of American forces in Berlin. HICOG had also received an erroneous ro-
port that DTLINEN and CADROIT were rendering Identity 1 financial support. The
latter impression was corrected during the meeting, and it was determined that
Identity 1 would probably not constituts a threat if it did not receive or devalop
financial backing. At the time of these discussions, it did not appear likely
that Identity 1 would receive such support, and its assots would probably to ad-
sorbed in other West. Dorlin or West German organisations. There were indications
that several of the "striko leaders," with the aid of ZRCODIFY, were gaining en-
ployment in the Federal Republic.
7. The only direct contact established by BOB with any of the "atriko leadera®
was with Identity 2, who was considered for employment with DTLD. The nature of
this contact is essentially covered in the following correspondence: SEIL oca,
DI 18181 and BGP-A 6120. Identity 2 was not hired by DTLINEN.
8. On 17 October 1953, the Chairman of Identity 1, Idchtity 3, informed Nelson 0.
Heard that he (Identity 3) intended to resign from Identity 1 cince he was receiv-
ing insufficient cupport to make a living. Ho stated that although he was recolv
ing com support from Identity 4, it was not enough to maintain his organisation
upca a working basis. Identity 3 caid that he had made overal radio appearences,
and that as a result of these, Identity 1 had been receiving up to che hundred vice
itora a day. Ho reported that he had attempted to gain financial support from the
West German Ministry for German fairs and other organisations, but had tom
ncucessful. He then suggested to and that Ideatity 1 and I could stabe

lish a covert working agreement with the latter organization furnishing the funds.
The offer had one attractive repost, nuncly, that Chip could, through the coasta
and of Identity 1, troch its present nisbica and expand into other fields of
psychological warfors. However, for the reason cutlined in peregraph 3 above, Han-
Clas instructed to cover all contact Mentity 3. After hȧ informed
that CLSIDẠY would not cadence the cuggested working arrangement, Iicatity 3 el-,
itted to liemand that there ware undesirable dimmista within identity 1 who would
have to be removed before the organisation could function effectively.

To his knowledge, however, no funds, as such, were over given Identity 1 from this
source.
14. Nelson G. Menard recently reported that Identity 3 has resigned frea hio poal-

that he has heard of no recent activity upen the part of Identity 1 and has heard of
no replacement being named to fill the post vacated by Identity 3.
15. The bembership list of Identity 1´as reported in DM-207 agrees in part with
a list forwarded by Henard. For comparison purposes, the latter list is forwarded

16. Since it appears that Identity 1, although reportedly not very active, has
boc receiving a small amount of financial cupport from CADONNA, it is possible that
a ccntinual investigation of its activities may be warranted. If to, it is sug
Ceated that future quorios be directed to John H. Quintance, the BOQUART Case Offi

Germany. Iuantity 5 felt at the time that urazbo and Identity 6 appeared to to tho
force necessary to got TPOCCULT ca its foot in West Berlin. It was decided that
TROCCULT would form a Borlin office which would be responsible exclusively for East
German operations. Although the mission of this office was not initially established,
discussion apparently centered about the formation of an underground trade unica to
oppose the Sant German FDG9. Identity 6 and Grambo indicated that funds in the
amount of 1,000,000 would be provisionally available,
.10. Identity 7, en East German refugee who was an active labor leader and had work-
od with the SFD. Oatburo, was designated the chief of the new TTCCCULT office. Ho
comenced work immediately, but it soon became apparent that ho was not going to
cooperate with either CADONA or ZRCODIFY Borlin, other then to use the latter's
offices. Identity 5 states that efforts woro made by Host Gorman and Belgian rop-
resentatives of TFOCCULT to bring Identity 7 into closer harmony with CADA, but
these wore fruitless. Identity 7 kopt knowledge of his activitica from CODIFY
Rambers, and it also became apparent that he was not informing TreSCULT of every-
thing either. The latter has evidenced a growing distrust and dialiko for Identity
7 which has almost approached the state of comploto disassociation. (For recent

11. Since the TFCCCULT Dorlin office was more or less an outgrowth of the 17 June
demmstrations, it was natural that fuentity 1 would rock a close working esspala
tien with that group. An attempt vas made, but apparently Identity 7, en indi-

impression that our conversations of last Novembar and Doconbar and
the remodial action taken by C at that time relative to the USE?

stall just such criticion. In paragraph 1 of the reference va indi-
cated that satisfactory anavers to our questions had been received.
In this connection we enclose as Attachment A a copy of Brown's
written answers to our specific questiona. (Attachment B is a criteria
for USP assistance.)

(b) Question: What, if any, project exists to relive TB incidence

Supplemental aid is primarily designed to help escapoes maintain
or recover their health. All agoncios know that evidence of poor health,'
supported by advice of a doctor, authorises special food supplements.
USEP funds can and have boun usod to provide bettor living conditions

(c) Question: How many people have received jobs through the

) Through the Kaiserslautern project, 40 Soviet escapees have
been placed in jobs and private housing found for 17 of this number.
(2) During the recont review of agency cases, about 50 Soviet
escapos proved to be employed. In some cases, agency participation
was apparent; in others, not. The degree of agency aid in finding
these jobs would be difficult to pinpoint.
(3) There is also evidence that 20 to 30 oncapees have onlisted
in Labor Service Companion as "other nationalitiou". Here again,
agency participation is difficult to determine.

hopefully, attack the problem causing poor attendance, namely lack
of interest and poor social adjustment.
(2) The World's YMCA conducts language training in Valka and
Karlsfold. Other classes were discontinued due to lack of attendance,
but a campaign is now in progress to rebuild the program.
(f) Question: What housing projects have been projected?
No further housing projects are contemplated until:
(1) The agency counsellors visit each family and definitely deter-
mine the problems facing them, and
(2) The present 126 to 146 spaces are offectively utilized.
13. Quention What are future plans for the itoms listed in para-
graph 127
The fundamental shortcoming in the USEP program to assist Soviot
esca poos is the fact that the counselling program has not been comploted.
Once this has been done, EPD Germany and the voluntary agencies together
will develop a comprehensive prograi for mooting all of the noode of
the Soviet group.
This plan will undoubtedly include inter alias

2. Increased supplemental and as families are visited and their
noods determined. Closo supervision will be exercized to ensure
that the agencies relato this aid to the solution of the fauilies'
problems, including health difficulties and housing.
3. All oucapees will to rogistored for enigration, the employ-
ablos among them will be trade-tooted, and arrangements will be
made to ensure that the proper vocational training is available to
those requiring it. In addition, assistance will be extended in
cloaring up legal problems faced by escapees which might bar then
from resettlement. The agencies will be required to subuit special
reports on their activitios.
4. Special efforts are being made to revitalise the vocational
training and im guage training program. Past experience indicates
that success in this endeavor will be limited. However, it is hoped
that offective individual counselling will eventually induce the
oscapesa to take proper training.

training and im guage training programa. Past experience indicates
that succosa in this endeavor will be limited. However, it is hoped
that offective individual counselling will eventually induce the
escapees to take proper training.

out exception, these agencies have strong and reputable American
affiliates which are accredited and recognised by the Advisory Com-
Bittoo on Voluntray Foreign Aid. In the case of 900, the American

9. Questions What is the status of the proposal to form a
to form a Russian
labor company which we understand has been approved in Washington"
General agreement on the formation by USAREUR of a Labor Service
Unit compriood of Soviet escapees has been reached by US BUCOM and
USAREUR. This project now only awaits final approval from the Depart-
mont of Aray as to cortain detailo, (It is understood that the Aray
has already agreed to the proposal in principal.) It is anticipated
that the project will be implemented in the near future.
The Unit, which will be assigned a guard mission, will comprise
initially 100 officers and mon. In addition, one can to act as staff
advisor to USAREUR on catters affecting the Unit will probably be
recruited. This position should have a field grade of pornaps a
Lieutenant Colonel. The personnel coiling of 100 pay be raised to
200 should it appear desirable in the light of experience. In order
to avoid tho appearance of supporting Groat Hussian or minority
national asperations, the shoulder flash for numbers of the company
would bear the name "ROSSISKIY" or Russian People, rather than
"RUSSKIY" or Russiane.
In the course of a recont discussion between representatives of
CAS, U.S. EUCOH, and this office concerning this proposal, general
agreement was reached on the following pointe,
a) Leadership in the company should be recruited from the more
recont Soviet escapees or defectore, rather than from the older "ouigre"”
groupi
b) Efforts should be made to recruit the maximum possible number
from the oscapeos rogistered with USEP; and
c) The TZOPE group should be strongly represented in the company.

T the fully with the basic objóotive being
their eventual resettlement is a country of insigration or, if this
, re-catablishment within the soonesy of their pre-
eitenco. Although the Escapes Frogram Division
operations Mission for Germany had contracts with both
Toustby Poundation and AFRP to carry out a counselling program for
Soviet escapes, and has spent approximately $14,000 on each agency -
agant
in this connection, to date the agencies have not completely counselled
all of their caseloads. Accordingly, it is most difficult to make any
sind of analysis of the amount of assistance rendered as compared to the
extent of nood. On Decombor 7, representatives of both agencies wore
advised by the Escapoo Program Division, that the counselling program
to completed in the noar future, and that USEP vill bo in a such
better position to evaluate the program of assistance to Soviet secapoes.
Quet
Dospito the admittedly unsatisfactory situation outlined in the
previous paragraph, portain positive action has boon taken by the EPD
and the voluntary agencies to provide assistance to Soviet oocapeos.
Reportedly, AFRP has distributed in the neighborhood of $13,000 in
supplemental nosistance in the form of food, clothing, lodging, oto.,
to 000apoea rogistored in their caseload. The Tolstoy Foundation has
distributed in the neighborhood of $19,000. In addition, threo special
housing cid projecto have been established in Germanys the Friendship
House in Munich with a capacity of 10 porocna, and the conter in
Kaiserslautern, with a capacity of 36 -- both oponsored by APRP, and
tho Toistoy home in Karlofold which has a capacity of 80 to 100. A

The Friendship House in Munich is small and is always full. The
longth of stay varies por individual to its primary purpose is to fur
nich tomporary housing for Russian escapees who come to Munich looking
for work. In 0029 Unges these periods of residence have dragged out.
At this home full caro and maintenance is given, as the residents are
mostly ineligible for rollof grants in Eavaria,
The Karlafold house was opened on September 4 and has accepted 26
oecapcoo to date.
In addition to the fact that each applicant is
scrooned by the agency and than by a consulate and USE? ropropontative,
the admission process is complicated by the need to tranofor unemploy-
ment and relief bonofits from other areas. While this installation to

of aid nooded by coat porcona selected will probably result in a fairly

of HICGG to pardon Soviet oscapoo's sentenced for minor offenses con-
mitted in an attempt to survive, thus clearing their records?
Do you
I want us to make any pitch on this?
In the past, potitions for clemency have only been presented to
the Clemoney Board of NICOC when a person was under active considera-
tion for resettlement. The Clemency Board has usually acted swiftly
with the best interest of the individual and of the U.S. Covernment
in mind. Rocontly, however, stops were taken to initiato potitiona
for clemency on all cases of the types mentioned in Question 10. It
is too early at the present time to foresee the result of this opera-
tion. However, it is balloved that it is not yet necessary for CAS
to approach the appropriato officials on this point.
11. Question: Is the USEP policy to reduce the numbers who can be
helped under the Progreat If true, what are the reasons for this policy
which appears on the surface to be a step backward from solving the
problem?
It is not the USEP policy to reduce the numbers who can be helped
under the Escapos Program. Ao a catter of fact, the USEP caseload has
continued to increase dospite the fact that over 5,000 have buon rocot-
tlod, and pany have been dropped for various reasons, including inoli-
gibility, local integration, and doath. It is true that the primary
purpose of the Program is to resettle oligibles abroad, and to integrate
locally those whose resettlement potential is low. This action, of end
in itself, dooa tend to reduce the number of persons who can be suboo-
quently helped under the Program. It is also the policy of the Progres
to create an ataosphere in which other programs which depond to a cor-
tain extent upon the psychological attitude existing in caigre oirolea
can operate successfully. In furthering this particular objectivo,
the Frogram has recently taken action to declare as oligible those persons
who, although having records as rinor originale, are of interest to U.3.
agencies, and have broadened the basis to accept any Soviot citison ag
oligible if he has in any way been under discipline of the Soviet Govern-
ment since January 1, 1945.

with employment potentials, but the agency demurred for fear the reject
would be ruined by inooluable moralo problems and by the lack of avail-
able space to bout quickly employment requirements.
To summarise on the question of "housing projects, and apart from

however, that full or almost full benefits are being derived from these
hoses, USTP is reluctant to establish additional housing projecta of a
temporary nature and it is contrary to USEP policy to enter into long-
tora arrangemente which would be entailed in provision of permanent

kret of 700PS embership, OFC will request the USP Divisione in each
country to confor eligibility on the individuals listed and to pay
particular attention that such individuals may receive personal atten-
tion in the future.
7. Question Is there any possibility of eliminating Tolstoy and
AFRP altogether and doing this job through another agency or agencies?
In consideration of this question, USEP has reluctantly decided
that it would not be possible to oliginato Tolstoy Poundation, since
Tolstoy is an old, established agoney with a rane-known and respected
within certain ouigre circloo. It may be possible, however, for cas
to undertake the oliuination, although CAS relationships with TP and
its Board of Directors are unknown to this office. Since AFR is a
relatively now organization, and the character of its European leador-
ship is much more undesirable than that of Tolatoy, it in conceivablo
that AFRP could be oliuinated from the Russian field considerably easier
than Tolster. Horoover, as the Chairoan of the Board of the ANRP is a
retired U.S. Adairal, ho would probably be inclined to go along with
the wishes of Government officials if it could be shown that the ali-
mination of AFRF was in the bout interest of the .. Govornant.
However, the elimination of othnia type agencies in this respect would,
perhaps, compel the Escapes Program to enter into relationships with
a religious agency, o.g. the WCC, in their stead and the successful
resolution of the Soviet problem would become automatically much more
difficult.
8. Cuentions How does an agency qualify for a USEP contract? What
are the requirements for qualifications
USEP currently has contractual arrangements with 22 voluntary
societies representing the major religious bodies (1.0. Catholics, Java,
and Protestants) and the major othnic groups represented in the popula-
tion of the United States of America. To qualify for a 3SEP atract
the agency, if it is wholly American in composition and incorporated
under the laws of one of the 48 States, or the District of Columbia,
must be accredited by what was known as the Department of Statute
Advisory Committee on Voluntary Foreign Aid, and which is now a part
of POA. The Executive Director of this Committoo is Mr. William H.
Hoahoa, w is also a staff member in the office of the Assistent
Director for Refugees and Higration, FCI. In addition to those agencies.

The Escape Program was originally outlined in DEPCIRTEL 676,
January 29, 1952 (Top Secret) which indicated that the Program would
be undertaken through contracts with voluntary agencies to provide
certain supplies and services to escapeos of recent date. Innesuch
as the largest and most important voluntary agencies operating in
Europa are of religious nature and endeavor to stay clear of under-
takings which have political implications, it was determined that the
Escape Progres would suppress to the extent possible the political
nature of its operations in order to secure and maintain the "good
will" and cooperation of those agoncios. In our relationships, how-
over, with cortain agencies of othnic character (0.5. APCH - Azorican
Fund for Csechoslovak Refugees), onpecially when these agencies are
directed by individuals in whom USEP has completo confidence, little,
if any, action has boon taken to suppress or disguise USEP political
implications. There is, however, a tendɔnoy on the part of USEP offi-
cialo to suppress political implications of the Program in their arrange-
ments with several agoncios -- due to their lack of confidence in the
loadorship of those agencies. Uro, Schaufuso, Tolstoy Foundation
Shoba Goodman, Amorican Prionda of Russian Proodgú, Max Draude Organi-
sation for Rehabilitation through Training: Anna Nation,ternational
Roscue Committee; and Michael Rodyk United Ukrainian merican Roller
Complètoo; are examples of Directora in whom USEP has little confidence.
This lack of confidence aŕisos from the fact that those personalities
apparently have their own axoa to grind. USEP has revonied, however,
and will contiuso to rovoal to a limited, oxtent, the political nature
of the Escapos Program to cortain solected persona in the voluntary
agencies who are subject to the necessary degroo of direction, and in
whoa confidence may be caintained. This course of action is motivated
primarily by the fact that political overtones of the Program cannot be
wholly hidden from an intelligent person, yet it is not in the Progrea's
best interest to advise officially the roligious bodies of the political
aspoots. Although the major religious agencios undoubtedly are aware
of the political aspects of the Program, they choose to ignore them so
long as they are not involved directly into any political operations,
and so long as they are not advised officially of them.
Quication: Ays there any means through which assistance to dosorv
ing coubers of 120PE (already on the caseloads) can be speeded up?

USEP officials throughout the area are continually endeavoring to
speed up Progren benefits to the ultimato recipients. Thio is applica-
ble to the entire caseload of all agencies and has not in the past boon
predicated upon combership in any organisation which may or may not be
of interest to U.S. Government agencie3. In this way, USEP endeavors
to extend Program benefits to all those eligible without focussing

tion of interest to agencies of the U.S. Governmont. Further, USEP

July 17, 1952
CRITERIA FOR PRIORITY ASSISTANCE UNDER ESCAPE PROGRAM
1. The Mutual Security Act of 1951 provides the basic legislative
authority for the Escapeo Program and thus establishes the elementary eri-
teria for extending assistance.
Section 101 (a)(1) of that Act authorizes the expenditure of a sua
not to axceed $100,000,000 "for any selected persons who are residing in er
escapens from the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Rumania,
Bulgaria, Albania, Lithuania, Latvia and Eatonin, er the Communist dominated
or Comunist bccupied areas of Corsary and Austria, and any other countries
absorbed by the Soviet Union either to form such persons into alarents of
the military forces supporting the North Atlantic Treaty Organization or
for other purposes, when it is similarly determined by the resident that
such assistance will contribute to the defense of the North Atlantic area
and to the security of the United States".
2. Officials carrying out this program she ld not become involved in
complex, time-consuming procedures in determining priority for assistance.
It is expected that a positive approach toward priority will be taken and
that criteria will am on simple and broad as is consistent with U.S.
interests. It follows that aid should be given immediately to pursons who
apparently meet the pri-pity criteria outlined below and should be withdrawn
only if reasonable evidence is brought forward which indicates that the
person does not meet these criteria,
3. The intent and purpose of the program is to aid now escapees fros
communist oppression. Whatever the merits of aiding persons who were dis-
placed before, during, or soon after World War II, such aid is not normally
a proper concern of this program. Moreover, quite apart from any other con-
siderations, the program does not have sufficient funds to assist many
porscas other than those who have recently escaped from behind the Iron
Curtain. In the foregoing perspective, the following criteria vill be utili-
zed by the Missions in according priority for assistance.
4. Priority for assistance in resettlement and for supplementary care
will be granted any person who escaped after January 1, 1946 from the USSR,
Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Runania,
Bulgaria or Albania.
5. Within the broad confines of the above, there will be certain
persons whos the United States ebviously will not desire to assist and there
will to others whose status in their country of residence after flight is
such that they possess the rights and coligations of nationality of the
country in which they have taken asylum.

Question:
What is planned to eliminate the duplication in caseload
of the two agencies?
--
:
Duplication in caseload between the various voluntary agencies
participating in the Escapee Program has been eliminated to an appro-
ciable extent. It has existel principally in the cage of two agencies
in Germany dealing with the Soviet problem Tolstoy Foundation and
American Frienda De Russian Frooded. This, however, was resolved on
December 7, 1953 at a meeting of the two agoncios with the Chief.
Escapes Program Division/US At this mooting the Tolstoy Foundation
was given principal responsibility for all cases which have a resettle-
mont potential. FRP was given all cabos which had limited or no
resettlement potential and cust, of necessity, bo sottled locally in
the Corman economy. The supplementary care and maintenance was divided
after a thorough discussion with each agency by mutual agreement. This
action resulted in establishing a cauolond in Germany of 79 cases con-
sisting of scope 100 people for TF, and 102 cases with approximately
200 people for AFRF. Now registranto by either agency will be referred
to Escapes Program field representatives (in Germany, Munich) for a
chack against, current card filos. After a dossior has been fully
developed on the caso, a dotormination as to the appropriate agency
will be cado according to the caco's recotticmont potential.
4. Question: What are the criteria for accepting a Soviet escapɔa 88.

There is enclosed the basic provisional guide concerning eligibi
lity, together with subsequent clarifications issued to the field on

CRITERIA FOR PRIORITY ASSISTANCE UIDER ESCAFEE PROGRAM
Text of tole-conference received from Department July 14, 1952
in amplification of criteria outlined undor Provisional Guide #11
"PEP Program is concerned with escapoos from Soviot or Soviet
dominated areas.
In view fact PEP funds are limited and because of
legislative history of program priority or preference must be given
to more recent escapees such as those who oscaped after January 1,
1948. Decisions as to application of fund must also be based on
results which can be achieved in terms of basic objectives of program.
In other words we are not distributing a limited relief fund equally
anong a designated number of people. We are more concerned with
those who have escaped more recently than those who have been in the
rofugee state since World War I or those who were uprooted between
September 1939 and January 1, 1943. The date January 1, 1948 is an
administrative device which should not be rigidly applied unless
Inter exhaustion of funds increasingly requires this action. or

"The current imigration of White Russians into Brasil began in 1913. It
has diminished since June 1954 in the face of the decision taken by the
National Institute of Colonization in Imigration (Instituto Nacional də
Imigração Colonia) (1.I.I.C.) on 16 Jun 1954. On that date, the
Directorate of the .I.I.C. decided to request that the Ministry of Foreign

on 30 Juns, Viccato RD, thon Foreign Minister, cant a circular to all the
consulates ordering a stoppage in the issuance of vicas until a final

extete principally in the case of two agencies
in Germany dealing with Gavdet problem Tolstoy Foundation and
American Prins Dr Blastan Freedca. Thie, however, was resolved on
Deceater at a meeting of the two agencies with the Chief,
Sacapee Program Division/SMS.. At this meeting the Tolstoy Foundation
vas given principal responsibility for all cases which have a rosettle-
ment potential. APRP was given all cases which had limited or no
- resettlement potential and must, of necessity, be sottled locally in
the German economy. The supplementary care and maintenance was divided
after a thorough discussion with each agency by mutual agreement. This
action resulted in establishing a caseload in Germany of 79 cases con-
sloting of some 100 people for TP, and 102 cases with approximately
200 people for AFRF. Now registrants by oitnor agency will be referred
to Escapee Program field representatives (in Germany, Munich) for a
check against current card files. After a dossier has been fully
developed on the case, a determination as to the appropriate agency
will be made according to the case's resettlement potential.

_ General agreement on the formation by USAREUR of a Labor Service
Calt comprised of Soviet capes has been reached by US BU00% and
SARUR. This project now only awaits final approval from the Dopart-
zest of Aray as to certain details. (It is understood that the Army
has already agreed to the proposal in principal.) It is anticipated
that the project will be implemented in the near future.
The Unit, which will be assigned a guard mission, will compriso
Haltially 100 officers and man. In addition, one man to acties staff
adviser to USAREUR on matters affecting the Unit will probably bo

200 should it appear desirable in the light of experience. In order
to avoid the appearance of supporting Great Russian or minority
national asperations, the shoulder flash for members of the company
would bear the name "ROSSISKIY" or Russian People, rather than
*RUSSKIY* or Russians.
In the course of a recent discussion between representatives of
CAS, U.S. BUCOH, and this office concerning this proposal, general
agreement was reached on the following pointes

7. Questions Is there any possibility of eliminating Tolstoy and
APRP altogether and doing this job through another agency or agencies”
In consideration of this question, USEP has reluctantly decided
that it would not be possible to eliminato Tolstoy, Foundation, sinte
Tolstoy is an old, established agency with a name known and respected
within cortain ouigre circles. It may be possible, however, for 245
to undertake the elimination, although CA3 relationships with 77 and
its Board of Directors are unknown to this office. Since APRY to a
relatively new organization, and the character of its European leader-
ship to auch more undesirable than that of Tolstoy, it is conceivabļo
that APH? could be olisinated from the Russian field considerably easter
than Tolstoy. Moreover, as the Chairman of the Board of the AYHP : a
retired U.3. Admiral, he would probably be inclined to go along with
the wishes of Government officials if it could be shown that the all-
nination of AFHF in the best interoot of the U.S. Government.
However, the elimination of ethnic type agencies in this respect would.
porhaps, coopel the Escapoo Program to enter into relationships, with
a roligious agency, 0.6. the VCC, in their stead and the success?l
resolution of the Soviet problem would become Automatically much more
difficult.

0. Questions How does an agency qualify for a USEP contract What
are the requirements for qualifications
USE? currently has contractual arrangements with 22 voluntary
soolotios representing the major religious bodies (1.o. Catholica, Jowe,
and Protestants) and the major othnic groups represented in the popula
tion of the United States of America. To qualify for a USEP contract
the agency, if it is wholly American in composition and incorporated
under the laws of one of the 48 States, or the District of Columbie,
must be accrudited by what was known as the Department of State's
Advisory Committoo on Voluntary Foreign Aid, and which is now a part
of 901. The Executive Director of this Committee is Mr. William H.
Locahon, who is also a staff member in the Office of the Assistant
Director for Refugees and Migration, FOA. In addition to those agencies
which have been incorporated in the U.S., USEP also enters into rola-
tionships with other organisations which are international in character

strong afticion to the Gorman country unit in its handling of the
program. Noodles to arc, Brom was considorably upset since it
appears that much of the criticion stemmed from KUMARK, It was his
impression that our converantions of last November and December and
the remedial action taken by OFC at that time relative to the USEP
Gorman unit's handling of the Soviet program had indicated bio willing-
nasa to do anything possible to correct deficiencies and to foro-
stall just such criticion. In paragraph 1 of the referenco wo indi-
catod that satisfactory matters to our questions had been received.
In this connection we enclose an Attachment A a copy of Brown's
written answers to our specific questions. (Attacliment B is a criteria
for USP distance.)
7. In gard to the criticion lovelled at Prom and the Gorman
unit by the Tomar's home office, the following pertinent excorpts
were passed to the undersigned;
"At the third meeting a great deal of stresa was laid on
the queation of the special interest cases of other Government
agen-los. I was able to duell at some length on the special
handling that we have given special interest casado, and to
cite chapter and verse of our report to the or2. Nonetheless,
St. was folt that we should very greatly interalfy our efforts

FROVISIONAL GUÏDZ NO. 1
July 17, 1952
CRITERIA FOR PRIORITY ASSISTANCE UNDER ESCAPE PROGRAM
7. The ku
I Security Act of 1951 provides the basic legislative
authority for the Escapes Freġram and thus establishes the elmentary eri-·
teria for extending assistance.
Section 101 (a)(1) of that Act authorizes the expenditure of a bus
not to excood $100,000,000 "for any colected persons who are residing in or
escapes from the Soviet Unica, Foland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Rumania,
Bulgaria, Albania, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, or the Communist dominated
or Comunist occupied areas of Germany and Austria, and any other countries
absorbed by the Soviet Union either to form such persons into elements of
the military forces cupporting the North Atlantic Treaty Organization or
for other purposes, when it is similarly determined by the President that
such assistance will contribute to the defense of the North Atlantic area
and to the security of the United States".
· 2. Officials carrying out this program should not because involved in
complex, time-consuming procedures in determining priority for assistance.
It is expoctal that a positive approach toward priority will be taken and
that criteria will remain as simple and bread as is consistent with U.S.
interests. It follows that aid should be given inmodiately to persons who
apparently meet the priority criteria outlined below and should be withdraw
only if reasonable evidence is brought forward which indicates that the
person does not meet these criteria.
3. The intent and purpose of the program is to aid new escapees fræ
emunist oppression. Whatever the merits of aiding porsons who wore dis-
placed before, durung, or soon after World War II, buch aid is not normally
a proper concern of this pregran. Koreover, quite apart from my other con-
allorations, this program does not have sufficient finds to assist many
persons other than those who have recently escaped from behind the Iron
Curtain. In the foregoing perspective, the following criteria will be utili-
zed by the Hissions in according priority for assistance.
4. Priority for assistance in resettlement and for supplementary care
will be granted my porson who scaped after January 1, 1940 from the uasa,
Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Rumania,
Dulgaria or Albania,
5. Within the broad confines of the above, there will be certain
porponɔ nhas the United States obviously will not desire to assist and there
will to others whose status in their country of residence after flight is
such that they popsess the rights and obligations of nationality of the
country in which they have takon asylui.

4. ON THE BASIS OF OUR RATHER SHORT VISIT WE CANNOT MAKE MUCH OF
AN ASSESSMENT OF HARRIS.
HE WAS EXTREMELY CORDIAL, ENTIRELY SYMPATHETIC!
With our InterESTS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME WANTING TO BE ASSURED THAT
HIS CONTACT WITH US WOULD NOT BECOME KNOWN. HE SAID THAT NATURALLY MANY
PEOPLE ASSUMED HE WAS CONNECTED WITH THE CIA BUT THAT IF THERE WERE ANY
[ASIS IN FACT FOR THIS ASSUMPTION HIS USEFULNESS WOULD BE AT AN END.
THIS WOULD LEAD US TO THINK THAT HE WOULD NOT BE WILLING TO DO ANYTHING
CNCUR BEHALF DURING FUTURE TRIFS TO CUDA. WE ALSO THINK, HOWEVER,
THAT HE IS ENOUGH OF A REALIST THAT HE WOULD NOT BE UNDULY UPSET BY THE
REQUEST AND THAT HE WOULD GIVE IT SERIOUS CONSIDERATION. WHETHER HE
WOULD BE MORE AMENABLE IF SOMETHING COULD BE DONE TO ENABLE THE CUBANS
MENTIONED ABOVE TO COME TO DES MOINES, WE DON'T KNOW. WE THINK HE
WOULD TURN DOWN ANY REQUEST TO HELP DURING HIS NEXT TRIP SINCE IT
WOULD BE MADE IN THE COMPANY OF OTHER CHURCH PEOPLE.
5.
WE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT TO TALK WITH HARRIS AT GREAT
LENGTH. COULD YOU GIVE US ANY IDEA OF WHAT THE POSSIBILITIES ARE OF
KELPING HIS CUDAN FRIENDS AND WE COULD THEN TRANSMIT THAT INFORMATION
TO HIM AT THAT TIME.
THANK YOU.
