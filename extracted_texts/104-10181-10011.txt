C. Visa delays. Havana is consistently
late in processing visa requests for foreigners
traveling to Cuba. Ruiz attributed the delays
to the red tape which involves processing the
requests through two ministries; The Visa Section
in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the
Directorate of Immigration in the Ministry of
Interior. Ruiz requested authorization for the
consulate to send its visa requests directly to
the Directorate of Immigration since this is the
section that ultimately determines whether a
foreigner may or may not enter Cuba.

FIELD NO. OSN 9937
An official Spanish service from a usually reliable source
who was able to read the memorandum reported below.
1. In a memorandum dated 30 January 1970 to Carlos A.
Neira Garcia, official of the Cuban Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, the Cuban charge d'affaires in Madrid
Chillermo Ruiz Perez outlined the salient current
problems of most concern to his mission:
a.
Building construction. Ruiz submitted
a proposal to Havana in December 1969 for the
construction of a building to house all the mission
offices including the embassy, the consulate, the
commercial office, the Cubana Airlines office, and
possibly the minister's residence. Ruiz had not
received a concrete reply to the proposal and he
urged Neira to take it up again with the ministry.
b. Radio facility. Responding to a request
from the Director of the Cuban National Fishing
Institute, Emilio Aragones Navarro, in
December 1969, Ruiz applied to the Spanish authori-
ties for permission to install a radio facility.
in the Canary Islands for communicating with Cuban
ships. The permission had been granted by late
December yet Havana had failed to follow up the
project with plans and instructions.

I told her that I personally regretted it,
individual and as Cuban, but that as a diplomat I could
not do her any favor because she had left Cuba voluntarily,
in flight, and that I could not render any assistance to
her and least of all protect her. If I had then been
able to take pictures, I could have sent them to Havana
for them to see (This happened when RUIZ had first arrived
here.)
RUIZ goes on to say that many people are misled when they
arrive in Madrid from Cuba, or have been misled by their
relatives. Parents bring their children--RUIZ says there
are over 400 Cuban children in one school. One of them
left ( school 7 once and passage had to be provided for him
at the airport in CUBANA and allowed him to leave because
they did not want to be mixed up in that affair. The child
was 14 years old and did not want to stay in Madrid in the
parrochial school with the monks. R says that should anything
happen to him and his wife wants to stay in Madrid, he wants
his children to return to Cuba and remain there until they
become of age and make their own choice, but that to take
children out of Cuba is a mistake.

is very selfish.
NILDA and RUIZ discuss her trip. R asks her if she

to go.
Apparently he tells her to go home that instant
and get ready, after she tells him that she has no time

TYPIC/QUTIMID/U.S. Company in Touch with Cuban Embassy, Madrid
ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES
1.
QUTIMID reported a 21 January 1970 conversation held
between the wife of the Cuban Charge in Madrid and a Miss
"Lourdes" speaking for the Grolier Company in New York.
Lourdes said that her company was undertaking some type of
Miss
publicity and wished to interview the Charge in this regard.
When questioned about what kind of work the company does,
Miss Lourdes replied that Grolier is an investigation (studies)
and consultant firm with central office located in New York City.
Lourdes gave her local number as 233-7448. She was advised
that the matter would be brought up to the Charge, Guillermo
RUIZ, and she would be informed of the results later.

.'
Later that day Aristides DIAZ Ruvirosa, the Embassy's
press officer and a member of the DGI, called back to say that
he would see her the next day in his office at 10:30.
3. According to QUSEQUIN, telephone 233-7448 is registered
in the name of Isaac BENDAHAN Sananes at Calle General Moscardo 8,
6th floor, Apt. C, Madrid. There are no Station or liaison traces
on BENDAHAN.
4. DO Base New York may be able to identify the Grolier
∙Company in New York and the reason for which their representative
was in touch with the Cuban Embassy.
5. Whatever follow-up action is conducted, the sensitivity
of the QUTIMID operation should be kept firmly in mind so that
our interest does not appear to stem from a technical monitoring
of the Cuban installation.

Report No. 263.
31 Jan. 1970
There is another unidentified Cuban in the office.
When RUIZ is left alone with her, he says that he feels
like an exile, that he has been out for two years and
is tired. There are many who want to be out of Cuba,
he continues, but it seems to him they want to keep
him out of the way. He goes on to say that LEON had
appointed him, and supported him, but although they
are good friends, he does not like to work with a
man whom one never knows what he is thinking, and one
never gets to know. R mentions a cable he had sent
and says it could have cost his assassination, and
that he had purposely done so to see if he were summoned
to discuss the matter in Cuba. He would have liked to
discuss it there, but they have apparently remained
silent. R Jaments he feels as if he were in Miami.

lost the ticket.
One Miss LOURDES calls on behalf of the Grolier Company

it is. She is told it combines study and research.

Mrs. Concepción CAMACHO de MATOS calls RUIZ. NILDA asks
if she is the same person who called the other day and
said she was the widow of... (MATOS). The woman says
'yes' and NILDA tells her: "Look Miss, you're playing
a very dangerous game. "
MATOS: I don't know what you mean, miss.
NILDA:
MATOS:
NILDA:
"
Well, because none of the comrades here is going
to allow himself to be provoked. So, please
do not keep on."
Well, I don't know what you are referring to,
miss, I am completely astonished.'
Well look, don't be astonished, you might end
up some other way.
MATOS: I don't know what you are talling about.
NILDA: Well, we do.
NILDA hangs up.
Mrs. MATOS calls the Ambassador's secretary again; it seems
there has been a misunderstanding.
NILDA:
MATOS:
Look miss, we do not wish to talk to you anymore.
We are telling you in a nice way. Please do not
call anymore.
I am not going to call again... I only want to say
I had nothing to do... I know nothing at all.

NILDA:
Only that I have received a message. I
received a telephone call... I have just
arrived in Madrid, I am not familiar with
Madrid, or know anyone.
Aren't you the one who called the other day?
You made a date..
'
MATOS: What kind of a date?.
NILDA: Didn't you make a date with the Charge d'Affaires?
MATOS: No, no, no. One moment, miss. I received a telephone
call and was told to call this gentleman, the
Cuban Ambassador. I could also tell you about
another ambassador, but that they were trying
to get in touch with me.
NILDA: Who are 'they'? To whom do you refer when you say
that 'they' called you?
MATOS:
I was called on behalf of the Ambassador of Chile
and the Ambassador of Cuba. I thought it was
extremely unusual, miss, because I don't know anyone
here.
NILDA: Didn't you call here a few days ago?
MATOS: I called when I was advised to do so.
NILDA: And you made a date with the Ambassador.
MAWOS: I don't know now what exactly did happen. I was asked

to talk with him and to get in touch with him, miss.

NILDA: Eut, who called you, `miss?
MATOS:
Whoever it was said "I am the Cuban Ambassador,"
so then it all seems to have been a plot, or
something of the sort.
NILDA: Look, if it is a plot I suggest you do not get
involved because where we are concerned it is
somewhat dangerous.
MATOS:
NILDA:
No miss, I am very proper and a serious person.
Since you are so serious and proper don't ever
let anything happen to you.
MATOS: I live with a daughter and you must realize that
I live only for her.
NILDA:
Well, look, if you live for her, don't get mixed.

MATOS: Very well, miss. I am deeply grateful to have been

enlightened by you.
I can see already that it is
simply a plot or an implication by someone.
It is a plot and we know it. And we know who is
behind it.
MATOS: Yes, miss, I would also like to know, I assure you.
NILDA: Well look, stay away from this mess or you'll pay
MATOS:
dearly... good-bye.
Fine, miss. I am also very grateful that you
have told me. My apologies, huh?

Nilda talks to Alicia. She says that she had a very nice time (in
Havana), but that the weather was very bad; it rained a lot and
it was cold. Nilda was with (in Havana) Alicia's children. Sho
says that they got very good marks in their studies and the little
one can read and they are very happy. Nilda also spoke with
Alicia's mother-in-law. She is suffering from la pres ion (high or
low blood pressure) and she has not been able to get the necessary
medicine. Then Nilda speaks of her own son. Sho says ho is very
tall and thin and that ho is working in tobacco. She says he is
in Guane (phon), and as she couldn't make the trip as it was two and.
a half hours long, they sent the boy to her house and she was with
him for a few days. She says the boy is very happy, he is a serious
type and causes no problems. Apparently Nilda's nother is ill,

together at the Castellano to forget their sorrow. Ruiz says
he is very anxious to move out of the place he is in, and aks

She is known to have lived in New York
for five years in the fifties ( on. 48th St.,
three blocks from Times Square), a city that
she likes very much. She goes shopping alone,
and once even to the airport in a taxi ( Juan
Antonio CURBELO, the embassy security officer,
did not like the idea) to wait for her husband's
arrival from one of his trips. She seems to
get along well with the wives of other Cubans
in the staff.
Nilda travelled to Havana on 30 January
1970 to see her son Guillermito, and returned
to Madrid on 11 February. Although RUIZ.
used her to send a lengthy memo to Carlos
NEIRA, his superior_at MINREX _ for text
see Attachment III_7, he was not very happy
with her trip- an attitude that Nilda resented
very much ("You are very selfish") until her
husband changed his mind.
Her parents live in Havana (local telephone,
2-8130). ✓ Cuban Telephone Directory lists that

CHILDREN:
1.- Guillermito ("Guille"). At 14 he is
the oldest and is currently studying in Havána.
He is very tall and thin. There were reports
that he was unhappy in Cuba, and his father
went to Havana on 16 October 1969 to solve a
"personal problem" with Guillermito. If true,
Guille no longer feels that way because on 26
December he was quoted to be very happy in his
new school.
Guille was scheduled to cut cane after
10 January 1970, but was actually assigned to
a tobacco farm in Guane early this year.

Late
DOB: Late January or early February 1930.
POST: Minister Plenipotentiary, accredited
" since 12 December 1967.
ADDRESS: Juan de Mena #8, Madrid.
TELEPHONES: 259-5956 (home), 221-7028 (office).
DOI: March 1970.
WIFE: Nilda VECIANA. Probably in her early thirties,
she is pregnant and was due to have her sixth child
in May 1970. However, her physician recommended
forced labor (reasons unknown), which was scheduled
for 17 April 1970. She has had difficulties with
her pregnancy because of recurring fainting spells
and overweight, which are being treated by Dr. HER-
NANDEZ and Dr. MATA ( the latter ordered lab tests
for Diabetes, the results of which are unknown).
.
Married for 16 years to Guillermo, Nilda
is a pleasant woman who has not been known to
quarrel openly with her husband or express
political or religious opinions, although in
this last respect she has recited the Lord's
Prayer in front of Embassy personnel, which
suggests that she may have been or is a practicing
Catholic.
Mrs. Ruiz is a language teacher by profession
( speaks English fluently ), and is active in
the Embassy as secretary to her husband and book-
keeper, but only on an informal basis.
Of rather weak personality [Exception,
see Attachment II; she was upset at the time 7,
which is reflected in the way that she handles
her five boys--"little beasts,", according to
Severina ORTIZ, the maid--, Mrs. Ruiz does not
permit them to be punished severely and is always
complaining that she does not spend sufficient
time with them.

EDUCATION: Aside from the statistics course
taken in 1960, RUIZ seems to lack, in the eyes
of some observers, a solid, formal education.
But he makes up for it by being an avid reader
(five newspapers a day, plus books). This impression,
however, may be wrong, for there are indications
that he either studied or wanted to be a CPA..
:
.
He understands and speaks English and
French (fluency unknown), and has undertaken
to teach grammar to the embassy staff.
Sensitive to art, or so he says, he
frequently complains of the general lack of
culture in Cuba. His vocabulary level is rather
low, cussing quite often in the presence of
others..
RUIZ is well-versed in world affairs,
and does have an understanding of international
trade.
He has read some of the works of José Martí,
whom he likes to quote. But there is another
book that he also refers to repeatedly, Kim PHILBY's,
the KGB spy who penetrated MI-6.
He is up-to-date on current intelligence
publications.
HEALTH: Blond, baby-faced, and blue-eyed ("Very
handsome," according to Anita, the young maid ),
RUIZ is known to be suffering from an undisclosed
liver illness for which he takes a medicine called
bilidis. Late in 1969 he was planning to go to
Portugal on vacation following the advice of his
physician, Dr. Pedro CABAS ( telephones, 276-7746,
256-2294 ), but he did not make the trip. He coughs
frequently, is used to cold weather, and was thinking
of going to the same gymnasium as his son Alejandro.

BACKGROUND: Guillermo RUIZ, familiarly known
as El Guajiro, probably comes from a humble
family in Cuba, as he lived in a solar ( in

In the fifties he emigrated to the United
States, travelling throughout the East Coast
and holding minor jobs. In 1957 he began to
work as an apprentice butcher for a Polish-
American named Alexander SAMKO, who had a
grocery store on Flagler St. in Miami. He
did so well in attracting Latin-American customers
to the store that he soon began to distribute
meat in the area for SAMKO.
He has said that when he left Miami
in 1958 he turned over to his brother a house
in North Miami, a brand new car, and over a
thousand dollars in the bank.
But his "success" could be traced, perhaps,
to another acquaintance that he is known to

He wears eyeglasses to correct astigmatism,
and is known to like skin-diving, a sport that
he practiced in Cuba.
In general terms, however, he enjoys good
health.
EMPLOYMENT: There is no doubt that Guillermo RUIZ
exercises the full authority that presumably he
should have as Minister Plenipotentiary (relations
between Cuba and Spain remain at this level
because of Spain's refusal to appoint a full
Ambassador after LOJENDIO was expelled from
the Island by Fidel CASTRO).
He is involved in and kept informed of
all matters that have to do with Cuban-Spanish
relations, including trade. He does not permit
commercial attachés to bypass him when they
submit reports to their respective enterprises
in Havana.
3
In addition, he supervises Cubana Air.
Lines operations, and no one may travel on
Iberia to Havana without his permission (this
applies only to Cubans, for tickets must be
paid in foreign currency). Evidently he controls
the Cuban Embassy in Lisbon, and Rafael FERNANDEZ
Sardiñas, the charge there, travels frequently to
Madrid for consultations with RUIZ ( "Our relations
with Portugal are not very good now").
Cuban officials arriving in Madrid must
consult with him before arranging visits to
Spanish officials or factories, and only 'he,
Juan Antonio CURBELO Lemes, Aristides DIAZ
Rovirosa, and Roberto FRANCO Oliva, are authorized
to issue visas for people travelling to Cuba.
He seems to have good working relations
with Spanish Government officials because he
is always careful to place all the "cards" on
the table in his meetings with them.

with an American of Cuban descent known as Joe LOUIS.
for LUIS, an underworld figure who was competing
with the Italians in the bolita racket in Tampa.
RUIZ himself has told close associates that LUIS
or LOUIS offered them $800 a month, plus car and
expenses, to supervise "collections" in Miami.
Furthermore, LOUIS or LUIS even asked them
to kill a man named FERNANDEZ, who was involved:
in the numbers game in Miami, for $5000 each.
In February 1958 RUIZ left Miami with Harry.
VILLEGAS Tamayo ☐ a Captain in the Cuban Army,
he has been seen at parties in foreign embassies
in Havana with Major Manuel PINEIRO Losada, DGI
chief 7 and three other members of the 26th of
July Movement and entered Cuba clandestinely.
At the triumph of the Revolution Alexander
SAMKO went to Havana, where he stayed for a
week at RUIZ's home, and offered him a partner-
ship in the business, which RUIZ rejected.
In 1960 he was one of 18 out of 5000 who
were selected by the Ministry of the Treasury,
where he was working, to take the full statistics
course outlined by ECLA. The course, which lasted
two years, included such subjects as mathematics,
finances, democracy...and Marxism-Leninism.
One of his schoolmates at the time was
Marta ARCOL, now director of the Art Museum of
Havana.
'
In 1963 he was sent to Mexico, and after
returning to Havana was appointed Chief of the
Trade School at MINCEX, post that he held for
two years.
In 1967 he was sent to Spain to replace
Ramón CALZADILLA as charge d'affaires.

Nothing is known about unofficial contacts
with other diplomats in Madrid except that he
is close to and exchanges information with the
Algerian Ambassador.
At times he tries to give the impression,
and this might be true, that he enjoys the full
personal confidence of Osvaldo DORTICOS and Raúl
ROA.
He frequently tells other Cuban diplomats
stopping in Madrid that he makes 90% of the
decisions without consulting Havana because
that is "why I am here for.'
Above all, he directs constant and bitter
criticism against the bureaucracy in Havana
because of its incompetence, which, in his opinion,
will cause Fidel CASTRO to carry out a major purge
after the 1970 sugar harvest comes to an end ("No
one in Havana wants or cares to make a decision").
The Peter Frinciple ( " In a hierarchy every
employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence" 7,
which he has read and is going to send to Fidel CASTRO
for reading on the advice of Melba HERNANDEZ, should
be taken as an example of what is happening in
Cuba. Furthermore, in his view Havana is always
trying to interfere with the Embassy in Madrid,
resulting in lack of co-ordination and even co-
operation. ( To Horacio FUENTES Martínez: " More
than lack of organization there is chaos in Cuba
today.")
He directs almost the same criticism against
his staff in Madrid because they lack qualifications.
for the posts that they hold. " They think that I
am a fool," he once told an associate, "but I
don't miss anything that they do."

aturn, he has also been the target of
criticism from Havana, first from Sonia GOMEZ,
who made a critical evaluation of the Embassy,
which he decided not to answer ("I took a
librium, smoked a cigar, and forgot all about
it").

☐ Sonia GOMEZ, a MINREX inspector close
o Vice-Minister Carlos CHAIN, was in Madrid
in mid-February 1970 for another review of
embassy accomplishments. But this time she
seemed friendly with Guillermo RUIZ. 7
On another occasion he complained to
Aristides DIAZ that he had received one more
critical report from Havana because the Embassy
"had not achieved much," although they had done
things that were not included in the yearly
plan.
But perhaps the most serious censure of
his activities came in by telex (" Why worry?
The Americans and the Spaniards intercept all
messages anyway") early in October 1969. Havana
questioned the way RUIZ was handling trade
negotiations with the Spanish Government. _ The
trade agreement was extended by mutual consent
to 31 December 1972.7
In his reply addressed to Raúl LEON Torras,
first vicë-minister of MINCEX and senior Cuban
official directly responsible for the talks,
Guillermo RUIZ defended his right to be "informed"
and "consulted" in rather strong language.
Therefore, he rejected that his cable number 521
was offensive to Joaquin ALVAREZ, a Cuban trade
official who had been the source of the complaint.
In the last paragraph he told Raúl LEON
that the indemnification question ( payment to
Spanish citizens who owned property in Cuba)
depended on his reply to Don Pedro SALVADOR,
a Spanish Foreign Office official, and not on
"bribery" conjectures.

- Evidently this last cable upset him so
much that he was nervous and particularly
security-conscious. Less than a week later,
The called Raúl LEON Torras and requested
permission to go to Cuba, ostensively to
settle a "personal problem with my son.
When he returned to Madrid on 29 October
he was a changed man, again fully confident
of himself. Nevertheless, he has told close
friends that he feels very lonely in Spain
and has had the desire to simply board a plane
and return to Cuba abandoning the Embassy.
Late in January 1970 he was again de-
pressed, for he felt like an "exile" ia
Spain after two years of service ( " Even
though LEON played a part in my appointment
I cannot work for a man that I do not under-
stand. Maybe he sent me abroad to get me out
of the way. I feel as if I were in Miami.")
He thinks he is "burned" in Spain, and
when he returns to the Island he will definitely
not go back to MINREX, but to MININT. He has
told close friends his term in Spain is up and
he will be returning to Cuba probably in the
summer. In any event, he does not plan to be in
Spain more than nine months. Nilda, his wife,
has stressed that they are leaving Madrid permanently
in July 1970.
POLITICAL AND IDEOLOGICAL VIEWS: Although
outwardly a "revolutionary", Guillermo RUIZ
is a man of moderate political views struggling
to justify the actions of his government in
face of the political and economic realities
of Castro's Cuba.

" U.S. power is beginning to crumble, but
the Soviets are revisionists.
" The Egyptians harm us when they buy sugar
from Cuba and then resell it to other countries.
"We have to be on the side of the Soviets
for two reasons: first from the military and
economic point of view; secondly, because whether
right or wrong they are on the same side fighting
those who are on the other side.
Cuba has had and has major discrepancies
with the USSR, China, and the U.S., but we are
on the side of communism because we are against
capitalism.
" Israel and Cuba have the same motivations.
That is why they are so successful against the
Arabs. They have no choice.
" The Egyptians and the Syrians are not
brave. The Israelites, like the Cubans, are
brave enough to face the enemy."
PERSONALITY : Guillermo RUIZ is an easy-going
rather simple man who no doubt enjoys the prestige
and success that he has had in Spain.
He has a strong personality, undoubtedly
the predominant pole in his marriage. He seems
to get along well with his wife. ( ". If anything
should happen to me and my wife wants to remain
in Spain, I want my children to go back to Cuba
to study. Then they can decide for themselves
what they want to do.")
Certain degree of racism can be detected
in his speech, for he always refers to Negroes
as niches, a contemptuous Cuban expression.

He is particularly aware of what he calls
"traps", and in this sense recalls that once

present could have been a "seditionist" ready
to be arrested" by the police. An inevitable
scandal would have followed. He adds that he
receives visits in the Embassy because there
he admits only those that he wants to see.
An interesting item is the case of
Conchita CAMACHO (telephone 201 4989), who
called RUIZ at the Embassy claiming to have
met him at a party and wanting to see him,
alone, at the Hilton for a "chat". ✓ See

FUENTES to check the telephone number ( " The
CIA has a new agent"), in spite of the fact
that Raúl LEON Torras was arriving in Madrid
on that night.
He and Fernando, his driver, waited outside
until the woman left the hotel with some men.
RUIZ wanted only, so he says, to warn her not
to get involved in matters between Cubans because
she could "lose her life".
Regarding communications, Guillermo RUIZ
has even suggested installing a radio transmitter
and speaking in code with Havana. 5 The Cubans
are in fact installing a radio transmitter on
Islas Canarias to communicate with their fishing
fleet. But RUIZ, in this particular case, has

on Christmas eve, the classical Spanish Nochebuena
He has also said that medicine in general is
quite backwards in Cuba.
Probably an atheist, he is known to believe
that "religion should not be considered a
handicap for people trying to return to Cuba."
2
On the other hand, he refers to Latin-
American diplomats as "bootlickers" because
they use the English language in parties, and
has remarked that "capitalism is no good".
RUIZ seems to have certain admiration for
Francisco FRANCO, who, in his view, is the only
reason why Spain has not turned communist. Of
course, it is doubtful that he really believes
this.
He does not hide his favorable opinions.
of the American people, who are "frank" and
"simple". "They treated me very well," he
told Raúl LEON Torras in December 1969.
On international matters he is up-to-
date and well-informed. Following are some
of his views, which are contradictory at times:
" Cuba is a political power, not a military
or economic power.
" The USSR has neutralized U.S. sea power
in the Mediterranean.
" Cuba can destroy Guantanamo whenever it
chooses to do so, although the base has lost its
strategic value to the United States.
" US-China rapproachment should be feared,
but also a Japan-China alliance.

stressed to the Spanish Government that Cuba
is willing to permit Spanish citizens to operate
the station, thereby avoiding any suspicion that
the transmitter will be used for other purposes. 7
In spite of his security-consciousness, he
himself is the target of certain control by Juan
Antonio CURBELO Lemus, the "cultural" first
secretary who in reality is the security man
at the Embassy ( RUIZ has complained that he
needs a "real" one in Madrid: " Sergio ☐ DEL.
VALLE, minister of the Interior 7 told me
they were getting someone ready to send as
cultural attaché" ), for CURBELO instructed
the front-desk girl to pass on to him a
summary of who sees who and for what, including
RUIZ's visitors.
RUIZ likes to recall the time when a Cuban
in his staff ( name unknown, but presumably he
is back in Cuba) spread the rumor that RUIZ
and Nilda were not well-liked in Havana, perhaps
to undermine his authority. CURBELO reprimanded
the man by stressing that "when Havana is doubtful
of anybody here in Madrid it uses official channels
to let us know."
.
Nevertheless, he does make mistakes, as
evidenced by discussing in his office, with
members of his staff, the possibility of advising
Havana that a Spanish foreign service officer
scheduled for duty there might be open for
recruitment. Recalling his constant warnings
that his office is bugged by Seguridad, such
discussion clearly exposes him to expulsion
from Spain.
By the same token, he likes to travel
by car to the interior of the country alone
( he must have powerful reasons to do so,

In this sense his inner feelings perhaps
lie closer to the theory of the betrayed revolution
but not for ideological reasons: the incompetence
of the Cuban Government has in fact sabotaged
the goals of the Revolution.
'
A member of the Cuban Communist Party, to
which he was admitted on the recommendation of
Armando HART Dávalos, secretary of Organization,
he is definitely not a convinced Marxist, and
consequently cannot accept the role of "robot"
required by Party discipline and vertical
structure ( Revolutionaries should not be
coerced by political control forms," he wrote
Telesforo DIAZ Portillo, a MINPEX official,
on 26 December 1969. " Communists are quite
meddlesome," he told another colleague soon
after, although in this instance he may have
been referring to the Spanish CP).
But the most important revelation of
his views came to light on 11 December 1969,
when he was quoted as telling a visiting DAP
official from Havana: " If I disagree with
orders, I question them because I am not a
robot nor do I have the mentality of one. As
a human being I express opinions no matter
the risk that I may personally have to take."
Obviously, a man who thinks in this way
cannot be a Marxist.
-
Aside from the constant criticism of
Havana because of incompetence, lack of vision,
and the unreal world they live in, he is quick »
to point out other deficiencies in life there,
as reflected in his directive to the embassy
staff not to celebrate Christmas together
because there are "hungry people" in Cuba. But
he did invite some of his associates for dinner

He almost never discusses women with
colleagues, nor is he known to be involved
in any extramarital affair.
✓ Possible exceptions: Vera VORODOWSKI,
his secretary now in Cuba. There were rumors
that RUIZ was the beneficiary of Vera's affection.
There is also a young Spanish girl named JIMENA
Inu), who addresses RUIZ in the familiar tu.
She lives in the house of Carmen LABRA or LABRADA.7
He likes to go to the movies ( saw Topaz;
no comments), and receive people at his home
for cocktails.
SECURITY : It is normal for any member of the
Cuban Foreign Service to exercise certain discretion
in the area of security, but Guillermo RUIZ is
particularly sensitive in this respect, which
perhaps could be traced to his probable involvement
with the DGI in one way or another.
He is quick to warn visiting Cubans of the
CIA's efforts ( "La Compañía Sociedad Anónima" )
to compromise them, even before leaving Havana.
"Our Embassy," he says, "is the primary target
for U.S. operations in Spain.
He keeps control of mail going to and
coming from Havana in the diplomatic pouch,
and states repeatedly that his office is
bugged and telephone tapped (" There are micro-
phones here the size of olives"). In addition,
he thinks he is followed openly by Seguridad.
For all these reasons he has asked Havana
for funds to build a new embassy, where he plans
to have a shielded room free from microphones. ( The
building, which will cost approximately $600.000,
was approved by Havana and a Cuban architect travelled
to Madrid in late March 1970 to discuss the project
with Sr. VILLARROYA, from Construcciones Azagra, who
is handling the real-estate operation, Villarroya's
telephone number is 254 4238.)

he is risking attack by Cuban exiles, a possibility
that he surely must not discard given the
reception that they gave Armando HART Dávalos,
Carlos CHAIN, and Carlos ALFARAS at Barajas
Airport on 30 June 1968). Neither his wife
nor CURBELO approve of this.
At times he is known to write on paper
key phrases or names when discussing confidential
matters in his office, or to speak very low.
Furthermore, he says he goes to Parque del Retiro
when he wants to discuss sensitive matters with
anybody.
In short, he is security-conscious, very
shrewd, and suspicious of anybody that comes
near him.
TRAVEL: Following are the trips that Guillermo
EUIZ made from October 1969 to February 1970:
To Havana to settle a "personal problem"
on 20 October 1969 by Iberia ( first class),
returning to Madrid on 29 October.
To London on 14 November 1969 for consultations
with Raúl LEON Torras, returning two days later
by air ( also first class).
.
To Bilbao, San Sebastian, and Burgos, by
car, on 28 November 1969, returning two days
later..
:
To Italy from Barcelona with his wife and
two children on 29 December 1969. He went to
pick up an Alfa Romeo, which he paid out of his
own funds. They returned through Florence, Genoa,
San Remo, and Barcelona, arriving in Madrid on
6 January 1970.

To Burgos by car with REGALADO (fnu) and
URQUIZA (fnu) on 24 January 1970.
To Havana on 20 February 1970. He was
scheduled to participate in trade negotiations
with the Spanish delegation that left Madrid
on 22 February 1970. RUIZ returned to Madrid
on 24 March 1970.
FRIENDS: Not much is known about Guillermo
RUIZ's personal acquaintances, except for the
following:
Pedro RUIZ.- A good friend who goes to
his home rather frequently, Pedro is quite
influential according to Guillermo. He is
also a friend of MASSO (fnu).
.
Carlos or Enrique CARRASCO. - He is a
partner of Carrasco, Muñoz e Iturriaga, with
offices at Avenida Generalísimo #28, 10th floor.
RUIZ meets with him often, either for lunch
or at his home. They seem to be good personal
friends. CARRASCO may have to do with arrangements
for the sale of Cuban frozen seafood. Travelled
to New York late in October or early November
1969. RUIZ is known to have visited CARRASCO's
office.
Rosendo CANTO.- Lives at Goya #54, Madrid.
His friendship with RUIZ may be interesting if
he is the same Rosendo Canto who was a well-known
batistiano (probably his father ). If this is
-
the case contacts with RUIZ are politically :
dangerous for the latter, unless he is using
CANTO with the approval of Havana. According to
Roberto FRANCO Oliva, the consul, CANTO
wanted to go to Cuba, live there for a year,
and then join the Cuban Foreign Service ( "He
is a fool," RUIZ ). CANTO's father is ill in Cuba

Consequently, a direct approach has much
better chance of success. It would be proof for
him that he is walking on firm ground by
dealing directly with Americans. Which leads
to the question of when. There are two key
factors to consider :
"
a) His recall to Cuba.
b) The 10-million ton sugar harvest, which
is scheduled to end on 15 July 1970.
RUIZ has indicated that he is unhappy in
his post--perhaps not really meaning what he
says--, which he has occupied for over two
years.
As he has said that Fidel CASTRO plans
a major purge after the 1970 sugar harvest,
he himself may be one of the targets. Assuming
that his ideological inconsistencies have been
noticed, the DGI, in the absence of proof
regarding his loyalty and considering whatever
support he has in Havana, may request his
recall at an appropriate opportunity: during
a major reorganization of the Cuban Government.
In any event, RUIZ does not expect to
remain in Madrid much longer, and is planning
to be back in Havana by the 18th of July.
If Cuba is successful in harvesting 10
million tons of sugar, and they have already
reached six, the "victory" that Cuban propagandists
will herald from July on may have a psychological
impact on RUIZ's thought. He will be less
inclined to defect, in place or otherwise, at
such time.

SUMMARY:
Guillermo RUIZ is a very shrewd,
articulate individual who has reached heights
that in all probability would have been beyond
his capability in normal circumstances.
+
Nevertheless, from what can be seen his
work in Spain has been effective, and he keeps
a tight control over his staff. He is a man
confident of himself and of the backing [ Ar-
mando HART Dávalos ? 7 that he surely must
have in order to remain in this sensitive post
of the Cuban foreign service.
Precisely because of his privileged
status RUIZ is very careful in whatever he does,
avoiding mistakes that would endanger his
position.
Therefore, he will probably resist any
indirect approach, which he will recognize in
time to brush it off.
But this does not mean that he is unapproachable,
for he is not. There is no question that his
personality is incompatible with the system that
he serves, although with profound misgivings as
to its efficiency. It is then a question of
how and when.
:
The very fact that he has made open remarks
suggesting his unhappiness with Havana and his
non-Marxist leanings in an office "bugged by.
the other side," as he points out, could be.
interpreted as a signal on his part indicating
that he is ready to listen.
But he will be suspicious of an indirect
or subtle approach, which, in his view, could
be a trap to compromise him, including a loyalty
test by the DGI..

9 January 1970.
One 'Miss' CONCHITA calls asking for RUIZ. NILDA says
she is his secretary and CONCHITA may leave the message
with her. C would like to surprise him. NILDA asks for
her last name; C does not give it to her because it
would then fail to be a surprise, but leaves her tele-
phone number (201-49-69) for R to call her after 8,
for she works until that time. On NILDA's insistence C
gives her last name as CAMACHO, adding she is the widow
of the doctor who was director of the Coimbra Hospital.
"
RUIZ calls Mrs. CAMACHO at 201-49-69. She begins the
conversation by saying they had met at a party which she
had attended with her husband at the Dominican Embassy in
Madrid. She reminds him that they had talked with the
Paraguayan Ambassador and former Dominican Ambassador
Rafael COMPRES, and that the party had taken place two
years ago. Despite all the details RUIZ insists he does
not remember her and asks how he can be of service to her.
She tells him "I have just arrived and find myself some-
what isolated, disoriented, and I must find work. I recall
you telling me on that ocassion 'If you should ever have
any problem and you come to Madrid, look me up.' One other
ambassador also offered me his assistance and I have tried
to locate both of you. ft
Mrs. C mentions having a daughter,
that her husband was a pilot and that she is a Spaniard,
adding she is not too old. R replies that in all honesty
he does not remember her. She insists on seeing him to
have a chat, and R suggests she come to his office at her
convenience. She prefers talking with him alone, without
his secretary or anyone else present, and suggests a bar
at some hotel like the Palace, Ritz or Hilton. He is
agreeable to any place she may desire; they agree to meet

RUIZ records following memorandum on tape:
Comrade NEIRA.- I take this opportunity that NILDA is
going to Havana to bring to your attention some of our
problems here in Spain..
"The first pertains to the construction project for
a building which I sent to CHAIN with the President of
the National Bank when he passed through here in December,
and to this day, after five weeks, I have not received.
an adequate answer. You know that when preliminary
negotiations are initiated one enters into certain obli-
gations with the land owners as well as with the
construction firm, to whom we must give an answer.
"On my insistence, Comrade ROA gave me... sent a cable
informing me that as yet the budget had not been approved
and he could not give me the results.
"Present: locales do not meet the Spanish minimum re-
quirements for working space. CURBELO brought from Havana
proposals for the leasing of a locale for the Commercial
: Office with a rental fee of $2,000 a month. We discussed
this proposal at a meeting of comrades here and it was
rejected in the belief that it was more advantageous for
us to buy. We also discussed this with Fermín GUTIERREZ,
who visited the Commercial Office and to whom we pointed
out that in view of the system of payment here in Spain
it was better to purchase a building, since this transaction
at no time would affect our system in our trade policy with
Spain.
"To the point of being persistent we should like to
request a building for all services: the Cuban Office,
the Commercial Office, the Consulate-Embassy Office, plus
living quarters on the top floor for the diplomatic
Representative, something with which I am not in complete
accord. In summary, a building which would offer maximum security
and freedom of movement. The Commercial Office would occupy
the first floor, the Embassy, the second floor, and the
third floor the living quarters for the Chief of the Mission.
This would resolve all our local problems and our re-
presentation in Spain.

Comrade Joaquín ALVAREZ reports that in reference
to the letters left here by LBON for the Ministers of
Foreign Affairs and of Commerce here in Spain, the former
is taking an offensive position in foreign relations as
you can see, and the Minister of Commerce has been quite
busy, for the entry of Spain in the Common Market is almost
a fact and conversations are in progress. This is why
they have assigned to Mr. SANTAMARIA, General Director of
Commercial Policy, the study of subjects which the Spanish
side plans to take up in Havana during the negotiations
in February. I am in touch with this man and in fact had
to call him up today, for he had said that before giving

"At present we have the case of a member of the

wording of that cable gives the impression that PINEDA is

it to me. The political position of PINEDA and other Cuban
writers should be investigated, as now they are putting
up on stage "La Noche de los Asesinos" and they also want
another Cuban writer to come. I should like to get your
advice in this area as I am totally ignorant of matters
related to culture, for we have no cultural attaché here.

Headquarters has just completed, th the able help of
AMEDIT-2, a thorough review of QUDOZE tapes for the last quarter
of 1969. We have added pertinent file material where necessary
in order to round out the picture, but the review emerges
primarily as an assessment of AMAUTO-1 as a personality and as a
recruitment target. We forward this study as an attachment hereto,
under separate cover, for your consideration.
-
2. Headquarters has not lost its keen interest in AMAUTO-1
as a long-range recruitment target, foreseeing the possibility of
defecting him in place (at least for the remainder of his posting
to Madrid), or defecting him outright (which would admittedly be
less desirable). In line with these purposes, we offer the follow-
ing readings, which may or may not be entirely applicable to
AMAUTO-1:
a. AMAUTO-1 is a shrewd, articulate person who has
reached heights that probably he might not have reached
under normal circumstances. His work in Spain has been
effective in general, and he seems to be very confident
of himself and of the backing which he thinks he has from
PBRUMEN.

'AMAUTO/1's desire to affiliate himself with an
exercise group (see paragraph 26b of the attachment)
might offer a possibility to put an access agent next
to him. The circumstance would be relatively normal, not
calculated to arouse his suspicions. The use of someone
of WOLADY nationality might, in fact, help to allay what
is evidently a tendency AMAUTO/1 has of suspecting provo-
cation.
f. Headquarters would greatly appreciate the oppor-
tunity of examining AMAUTO/1's X-rays. In this connection,
we would like to see an investigation of the physician used
on this matter (see paragraphs 31 and 32 of the attachment).
T
g. We would like to have Madrid's assessment of the
diplomat mentioned in paragraph 8 of the attachment.
. r
4. At the same time, we would appreciate it if Miami could
follow down any of the leads stemming from AMAUTO/1's time in
WOLADY. We are trying to trace his entrance back in the 1950's
and as much of his time here as possible, and perhaps Miami
Station can develop leads on the persons mentioned in paragraph
24 of the attachment hereto, especially in reference to the
brother left with the house. (Note Below.).

b. Nevertheless, he has received some rather telling
criticism of a professional nature, even though it is
unknown whether this criticism also touches on his personal
life. Perhaps because of this, AMAUTO-1 seems to be very
careful in whatever he does, avoiding mistakes that would en-
danger his position, and avoiding any real or fancied
provocation.
.C. There seems to be little question that AMAUTO-1 is
approachable, although he would probably resist any
indirect approach in which "cards are not laid on the table.”
It appears very likely that his character is basically incom-
patible with the system he serves (with profound misgivings
as to its efficiency).
d. The very fact that he has made open remarks suggesting
his unhappiness with PBRUMEN and his non-Marxist leanings in
an office he himself points out is "bugged by the other side"
could be interpreted as a signal from him, indicating that he
is ready to listen. His remarks on the subject might be those
of a man who believes he can "jump off" at any time, if
necessary. Note that he tends to live with criticism from
his home office rather than try to get out from under
perhaps meaning that he would not accept a PCS assignment
home. (The attachment bereto shows him describing a
compatriot who wishes to return home as "a fool.") He has
said himself that he believes AMTHUG-1 plans a major purge
for mid-1970, and he might consider himself as a victim of
that purge.
e. A fact which might affect timing is the arrival of
a child in May. If he were to persuade his wife (and his
government) to have the child in Spain, rather than return
home for it, he would have a good excuse for requesting the
presence of his oldest child (the only one who is now at
home). If his wife returns home for delivery, he would (for
a time at least) have three hostages in PBRUMEN instead
of one.
f.
'
UFGA-19006 reported a 1964 attempt to get at AMAUTO-1
through his wife's relatives. The consensus at the time was
that AMAUTO-1 is probably immune to this type of approach.
Headquarters, therefore, still opts for a logically developed,
"traditional" recruitment build-up.
3. In line with the above, Headquarters suggests to Madrid
certain lines of action which might be followed in an attempt to
know more about AMAUTO-1. These actions might seem somewhat easier
from our perspective than they actually are in the field, but we
propose them for your consideration.
8.
The man handling the new construction work (paragraph 16
of the attachment) should be checked out.
b. The established pattern of lonely automobile trips
outside the capital (see paragraph 22 of the attachment)
might be instructive to follow down. At least, the situation
might offer a chance for approach or for subsequent handling.
c.
"
AMAUTO-1's desire to see more people at home, and
the indication that he discusses important matters at home
becomes doubly interesting with the possibility of a vacant
house next door (see paragraph 18 of the attachment). The
person who owns the apartment building might offer a fruitful
lead.
d.
The apparent hostility of the current maid (see para-
graph 24 and 27 of the attachment) might offer further
exploitation.

5. RUIZ brags that in 1960 he was one of 18 persons out
of 5,000 who were selected by the Ministry of the Treasury,
where he was working at the time, to take a statistics course
offered by CEPAL. The course, which lasted two years,
included such subjects as mathematics, finance, democracy (?),
and Marxism-Leninism. One of his schoolmates at the time was
Marta ARCOL, now the director of the Museo de Arte in Havana.
(It is interesting to note that in UFGA-13595 RUIZ was
described as an anti-Communist as of 1960 by a Cuban refugee.
6. UFG-1539 reported RUIZ as Chief of the Department of
Construction Expenses Studies of the Ministry of the Treasury
in 1962, and be was described as a militant Communist. In
1963 he was in Mexico, and UFGA-11065 mentioned him as G-2,
living at Calle Cuenavaca 35, apartment 7. A report from
LITAMIL-9 in 1964 characterized RUIZ as a violent CASTRO
_partisan, and ANUG-) in 1964 described RUIZ as a CUIS officer.
Presidential Decree 3440 of 4 August 1964 (UFGA-19006) reported
RUIZ as being appointed Vice Minister of Foreign Commerce,
and QUDOZE has him appointed about that time as chief of the
trade school at "MINCEX, a post he held for two years. In 1967
he was appointed charge d'affaires in Madrid vicc Francisco Ramon
CALZADILLA.
ON THE JOB
7. There seems little doubt that RUIZ exercise the full
authority that presumably he should have as Minister Pleni-
potentiary. The relations between Cuba and Spain appear to
remain static because of Spain's refusal to appoint a full
Ambassador to Cuba after LOJENDIO was expelled from the island
by CASTRO in 1959. RUIZ is involved in and is kept informed
on all matters related to Cuban-Spanish relations, including
trade. He does not seem to permit commercial attaches to bypass
him when they submit reports to their respective home offices in
Havana. In addition, RUIZ takes a keen and active interest in
Cubana operations, and he has said that no one may travel to
Havana on Iberia without his permission. He insists that Cuban
officials arriving in Kadrid consult with him before arranging
visits to Spanish officials or factories. He seems to have
good working relations with Spanish government officials,
because he is always careful to "put all his cards on the table"
in meetings with them. (The tenor of his conversation seems to
emphasize that he likes things this way in all his relations,
personal as well as professional).
8. Little appears concerning RUIZ' unofficial contacts
with other diplomats in Madrid, except that he is close to and
exchanges information with the Algerian Ambassador. (Accord-
ing to current records, this is Ahmed LAIDI, posted to Madrid
on 15 December 1966, living at Calle Tiemblo 3, Ciudad Puerto
de Fierro. Latest desk traces show this person as born 20 April
1934 in Oudja, Morocco, and as of 25 October 1966 to have been
the Director General of the Foreign Ministry in charge of
political, economic, and cultural affairs. He is described as

reserved, intelligent, and probably something of an operator.
He was Ben Bella's chief of cabinet before joining the Foreign
Office in 1964, and he functions: more on special assignment
than as part of the chain of command. He was a member of the
Algerian UN delegation as of 28 September 1965.)
9.
RUIZ trics to give the impression that he enjoys the
full confidence of Osvaldo DORTICOS and Raul ROA, thereby
lle
being able to exercise the full authority of his position.
frequently tells other Cuban diplomats stopping in Madrid that
he makes 90% of the decisions without consulting with Havana,
explaining that "this is the reason I am here."
10. Above all, RUIZ directs constant and bitter criticism
against Havana, because of what he terms the incompetence there.
In his opinion, this generalized incompetence will cause CASTRO

Havana is always trying to interfere with the Embassy in
Madrid, a situation which results in a lack of; coordination
and cooperation. RUIZ directs the same criticism against his
staff in Madrid, because his personnel lack qualifications for

strong language, RUIZ defended his right to be informed and
consulted on the matter, denying that his cable number 521 was
offensive to Joaquin ALVAREZ (Director of Trade with Western
Europe and North America), who was evidently the source of
criticism against RUIZ.

Under Separate Cover Attachment to: OSMW-11726
CHRONOLOGY
Orestes Guillermo RUIZ Pérez
DOB: c. 1931
Cuban Minister Plenipotentiary to Spain,
accredited 12 December 1967.
1.
RUIZ probably comes from a humble family in Cuba, because
he lived in a solar (semi-slum area) and began to work when he
was only fourteen years old. This circumstance suggests that he
lacks a formal education. He appears to come from a "revolutionary"
family (his father was identified as a Communist and a leader of
the barbers' union in UFGA-13595, and a brother was identified
as a member of the DSE as of 1964 in UFGA-19006); 2/64 (87-785286)
755290)
2. In the fifties RUIZ emigrated to the United States,
traveling throughout the cast coast and holding minor jobs. In
1957 he began to work as an apprentice butcher for a Polish-
American named Alexander SANKO, who had a grocery store on
Flagler Street in Miami. He evidently did so well in attracting
Latin American customers that he soon began to distribute meat in
the area, working for SAMKO (RUIZ seems to be somewhat proud
of this success). He also appears proud of the fact that when
he left Miami in February 1958, he left his brother (same brother?)
a house in North Miami, a brand new car, and over $1,000 in the
bank.
3. Although he did well in the meat business, he traces a
large part of his success to another acquaintance in Miami: an
American of Cuban descent known as Joe LOUIS (or LUIS). Joe
LUIS was an underworld figure who was at that time competing
with the Italians in the bolita (numbers) racket in Tampa. RUIZ
and MOLEON (fnu), another Cuban exile, were each offered $800
a month by LUIS to supervise bolita collections in Miami. (There
is no specific indication that RUIZ took his bolita friend up on.
this offer). Furthermore, LUIS went so far as to offer RUIZ and
MOLEON $5,000 apiece to kill a man named FERNANDEZ (fnu), who was
also involved in the bolita racket in Miami.
4.
In February 1957 (note the 1958 date, above; perhaps
an error on RUIZ' part) RUIZ left Miami along with a man named
VILLEGAS (whose first name might be Harry) and three other
members of the 26th of July Movement. They entered Cuba clandes-
tinely. When the revolution triumphed in Cuba, Alexander SAMKO
went to Havana, where he stayed for a weck as RUIZ' house guest.
SAMKO offered RUIZ a partnership in the meat business in Miami
if he would return. RUIZ rejected the offer, saying that the
Revolution needed him.

18. Nevertheless, RUIZ has several times mentioned that
he holds his really important conversations at home, and that he
would rather see more people at his home instead of at his
office. (In this connection, it is noted that the house next
door to his --- Calle Triana 44 --- which used to be a home for
the aged) is now empty. The owner of the apartment building
where he lives is Ignacio ARTERO, a Spaniard.
19. RUIZ has even suggested installing a radio transmitter
and speaking in code with Havana. The Cubans are in fact
installing a transmitter on the Canary Islands, but RUIZ,
characteristically keeping his actions correct, has stressed
to the Spanish that Cuba will not use the transmitter for other
than legitimate commercial purposes. RUIZ even offered to allow
Spanish citizens to operate the station in order to emphasize'
his point.
20. Correct as he generally is in his professional
behavior, RUIZ made what appears to be a mistake in discussing
with members of his staff the possibility of telling Havana that
a Spanish foreign service officer scheduled for duty there (Juan
TORROBA Gomez, cf. OSMA-25692) might be open for recruitment. If
one recalls RUIZ' constant warnings that his office is bugged by
Seguridad, the discussion about TORROBA clearly exposes him to
action by the Spanish authorities.
21.
RUIZ himself is the target of what appears to be
control by Juan Antonio CURBELO Lemus (201-733544) who is
allegedly the First Secretary in charge of cultural affairs
but who seems to be the "security man" in the Embassy. (We
note that CURBELO's photograph was shown to AMBEDEW-1, who did
not recognize the likeness). RUIZ has complained at least once
that he needs a "real" cultural attache. CURBELO has instructed
the front-desk girl to pass on to him a summary of who sees whom
at the Embassy and for what purpose, including RUIZ' visitors.
(Given RUIZ' near-mania for running his own shop, CURBELO must
indeed exert an acknowledged security control).
22.
Despite security considerations, however, RUIZ appears
addicted to taking automobile jaunts by himself to the interior
of the country. He must have very powerful reasons to do so, for he
is probably exposing himself to attack by Cuban exiles. Given the
reception accorded to Carlos ALFARAS. Armando HART, and Carlos
CHAIN at the Barajas airport in June 1968; RUIZ might be
unnecessarily exposing himself. Hc has not told anyone of
where he goes or what he does, and both his wife and CURBELO
strongly disapprove of his custom.
FAMILY
23. RUIZ' wife is Nilda VECIANA, who was reported on in
UFGA-19006. She is probably in her early thirties. She is
pregnant and due to have her fifth (?) child carly in May 1970.
She has had difficulties with her pregnancy because of recurring
:

;

-

-
fainting spells and overweight. These conditions are being
treated by Dr. HERNANDEZ (fiu) and Dr. MATA (fnu).
24.
Nilda is a pleasant woman who has not been known to..
quarrel with her husband or express political or religious opinions,
although once she recited the Lord's Prayer by heart in front of
others. A teacher by profession, she handles the bookkeeping at
the Embassy on an informal basis. She appears to have a rather
weak character, judging from the way she handles her boys. Accord-
ing to Severina ORTIZ Gomez, the maid, these are little beasts, who
treat the servants badly, even reviling them with obscenities,
while referring to their mother as "la chula." Nilda does not
permit the boys to be punished.
25.
Nilda goes shopping by herself, and once she even took
a taxi by herself to the airport to meet her husband, even though
CURBELO did not like the idea at all. She seems to get along
well with the wives of other Cubans on the staff.
26. RUIZ: children are:
a. Guillermito. He is the oldest and is now
studying in Havana. There were reports that he was
unhappy the re, and RUIZ asked on 16 October 1969 to go
to Havana to settle a personal problem with Guillermito.
If there were a problem, it seems to have been solved,
because RUIZ on his return quoted Guillermito as being
very happy in his new school. (Some time ago, Mrs. Hector
GALLO Portieles was constantly needling the other women
about not being "revolutionary" enough and took Nilda
RUIZ to task for having her children with her instead of
at school in Cuba. The RUIZ family had brought four of
their children with them, and later the other(s) came
to join them, before the older one returned to school.
RUIZ once told a visitor that Guillermito had been
left with his grandparents during their exile in Miami
and had been very resentful of it, so they had been
very careful ever since not to repeat that mistake).
b.
Alejandro. He is about six years old. Accord-
ing to those who know him, he is the real devil of the
lot as well as a good swimmer. He is taking guitar
lessons, goes to Colegio Estilo, and swims at Cimnasio
Mascardo, Pilar de Zaragoza 99. (Nilda has talked to
the Gimnasio people about RUIZ' going there also for
swimming or exercise).

13. Evidently, this last piece of criticism upset RUIZ
so much that he was nervous and particularly security-conscious.
Less than a week later he called LEON in Havana and requested
permission to go to Cuba, ostensibly to settle a personal
problem with his son. However, his wife explained to another
person in the Embassy that RUIZ' trip was due to his sick
mother. His trip was probably due to the exceptionally sharp
criticism and RUIZ' desire to clear it up personally.
14. When RUIZ returned to Madrid on 29 October 1969, he
was a changed man, again relaxed and fully confident of him-
self. Nevertheless, be has told close friends that he feels
very lonely in Spain and at times has had the desire simply to
board a plane away from Spain and abandon the Embassy. Il is
always careful to say he desires to return to Havana, but he
leaves room for the inference that he would rather go somewhere
clse. He believes that he is "burned" in Spain. He has said
that when he returns to the island, he will definitely not
return to his Ministry.
SECURITY AND SECURITY-CONSCIOUSNESS
15.
RUIZ seems to be particularly sensitive in the area
of security-consciousness. This attitude can possibly be traces
to an involvement with the DGI in one way or another, but his
background and especially his political views (sec below).
would appear to argue against his affiliation. RUIZ is quick to
warn visiting Cubans against the efforts of what he terms "la
compania, sociedad anosima" to compromise them, even before
they leave Havana, indicating RUIZ' possible belief in the
omnipresence and power of the sociedad anonima. He censors mail
going to and coming from Havana, and he repeatedly states that
his office is bugged, his telephone is tapped, and that he is
followed quite openly wherever he goes. He attributes this
surveillance to the Seguridad, and he probably ascribes it to
the Spanish. (Note that, despite his "knowledge" that his words
go to hostile surveillance, he still dares to express critical
opinions openly).
16. This security-consciousness is apparently the big
reason he has asked Havana for funds for a new Embassy building,
where he plans to have a shielded room free from bugs. He intends
to have Havana send electricians for the job and Cuban personnel
to act as doormen, etc.. with the wives of the latter to be his.
char force. He seems fanatic on the subject of not having any
Spanish personnel in the building. (Note that one Sr. VILLARROYA,
of Constructiones Aznar in Madrid, is handling the real estate
operation).
17.
RUIZ is particularly aware of what he calls "traps."
He once recalled that he had been asked to dinner by the wife
of a VIP and, after accepting the invitation, was told that a
priest would also attend. He did not attend the dinner,
although it considerably upset his hostess, because he was
afraid of a scandal arranged by the police. He said that he
receives only in the Embassy, because through that door can
enter only those whom he wants to see.

27.
All four children are very spoiled and have caused
several maids to leave their jobs. Severina bitterly complains
that the children snow no respect for their parents, and that is
the reason Severina gives for her hate for Nilda.
EDUCATION AND CULTURE
.28. Aside from the two-year statistics course taken in
1960, RUIZ appears to lack a solid, formal education, although
he makes up for it by being an avid reader (five newspapers a.
day plus books). He understands and speaks English and French
(fluency unknown) and has undertaken to teach grammar (presumably
Spanish) to the Embassy staff.
29. RUIZ appears to be sensitive to art, and he frequently
complains about the general lack of culture in Cuba. (This
might indicate that RUIZ considers himself "above" the Revolution).
He shows some of the general inconsistencies of the self-educated.
For example, his vocabulary level is rather low, and he curses
frequently when talking to other male members of the staff. On
the other hand, he seems rather well versed in international
affairs and has a good understanding of international trade.
is probable that he has read some of the works of José Marti and,
although he dictates letters to his secretary, he types some of
his own reports to Havana.

30. RUIZ suffers from what his wife has described as a liver
illness (not further specified) for which he takes a medicine
called bilidis. (This may refer simply to the medical words for
"liver disease". Competent, experts here guess that the medicine
is used for anything from chronic constipation to gassiness
and constant eructation because of inadequate digestion of fatty
foods. It is possible that RUIZ suffers from the hard-to-pin-down
mal de foie%;B which can be found in a high-strung, hard-driving
person. RUIZ' evident use of librium (see above) might also
suggest this condition).
31. Late in 1969 RUIZ was planning to go to Portugal to
rest, following the recommendation of his physician Dr. CAVAS (also
received as CABAS and CALDAS), and whose telephone number appears
to be 276-77-46. There is also a mention of a Dr. PERIU, but his
relationship is indistinct. RUIZ coughs frequently, is used to
cold weather, and was planning to go for his health to the same
Gimnasio as his son, Alejandro.
32. A July 1968 man orandum for the record stated that RUIZ
suffers from a spinal ailment resulting from a fall he had about
12 years ago.
Since then he has had chronic backaches which were
particularly severe during the time that he was in the U.S.,
Haiti, and Santo Domingo. His pains have recurred since he
arrived in Spain. On 3 June 1968 he had a severe attack and was

together, and they are not heard to argue. On the other hand,
there appear to be very deep inconsistencies in his public
and private behavior. Sometimes he speaks like a man at war
with himself.
36. A certain degree of racism can be detected in his
constant reference to blacks as "niches," a disrespectful
Cuban colloquialism roughly comparable with the pejorative
word, "nigger."
37. RUIZ almost never discusses women with his colleagues,
except for one off moment when he mentioned a girl he knew
in the United States before the Revolution. Perhaps RUIZ wisely
remembers that Nilda also works at the Embassy and refrains
from mentioning women on her account. In any case, he is not
known to be involved in any extramarital affair. (Still, one
wonders about the custom of absenting himself by automobile
into the interior of Spain).
'
-
38.
His habits seem to be simple: he likes movies; he
has read Topaz (but made no comment thereon); and he receives
people at his home for cocktails.
POLITICAL AND. I DEOLOGICAL VIEWS
39.
Although outwardly a "Revolutionary," RUIZ gives much
more the appearance of a man with moderate political views
struggling to justify to himself the actions of his government,
especially in view of the political and economic realities of
his country. It is possible that his feelings might lie
closer to the theory of the "betrayed revolution" ---but not
for strictly ideological reasons. The incompetence of the
Cuban governmental bureaucracy, for example, has sabotaged the
revolution.
40.
In the first place, RUIZ definitely does not seem
to be a Marxist and consequently he cannot accept the role of
"robot" (his term) required by Party discipline and vertical
structure.
a. On 29 December 1969 he wrote to Telesforo
DIAZ Portillo, a MINREX official: "Revolutionaries
should not be coerced by forms of political control."
"
b. On 11 December 1969 he told a visiting
Agropecuario official from Havana that:
if I
disagree with orders, I question them because I am
not a robot nor do I have the mentality of one. A-s
a human being I express opinions no matter what the
risk that I may have to accept personally."

8. "We have to be on the side of the Sovicts
for two reasons: first from the military and economic
point of view; secondly, because, whether right or
wrong, they are on the same side fighting those who
are on the other side."
'
'
h. "Cuba has had and now has major discrepancies
with the USSR, China, and the US, but we are on the
side of communism because we are against capitalism.'

C.
RUIZ seems to have little compunction in talking
to what he thinks of as old equaintances, even though
they may be on the opposite side of the political, fence
from him. He once mentioned how he went out of his way
to greet a "gusano" on the street because they had been
friends in Havana The Cuban exile evidently turned away
from him, but RUIZ defended his own action in initiating
the greeting.
41. Aside from the constant criticism of Havana's incompe-
tence, lack of vision, and lack of realism, he is quick to point
out the deficiencies of life in Cuba as reflected in his directive
to his Embassy staff not to celebrate Christmas together, because
there are hungry pcople at home. RUIZ has also said that medici ne
in general is quite backward in Cuba.
'
42. Although he is probably an athiest (or likes to think
of himself as one), he is known to believe that "religion should
not be considered a handicap for persons trying to return to Cuba."
He does not hide his views of the American people, either, for
he describes Americans as "frank" and "simple". "They treated
me very well,' he told Raul LEON Torres in December 1969. On the
other hand, he refers to Latin American diplomats as bootlickers
because they use the English language at parties, and he has
remarked that "capitalism is no good."
"
"
43.
He seems to have a certain admiration for General
Francisco FRANCO, of whom RUIZ has said: "FRANCO is the only
reason that Spain is not Communist. RUIZ also called FRANCO
"one of the few most brilliant politicians of all time." These
seem like strange words for a man as security-conscious as he.
44.
He appears to be well-informed on international matters.
Some of his views are contradictory at times, but they characterize
him as what might be called an undecided realist:
A. "Cuba is a political power, not a military or
economic power.
b.
"
"The USSR has neutralized US sea power in the
Mediterranean."
"Cuba can destroy Guantanamo whenever it chooses
to do so, although the base has lost its strategic value
to the United States."
d.
"US-China rapproachment should be feared, but
also a Japan-China alliance."
c.
"US power is beginning to crumble, but the
Sovicts are revisionists."
f.
"The Egyptians harm us when they buy sugar from
Cuba and then resell to other countries."

treated by the Embassy's Spanish doctor VILLALANDA (fnu), who
prescribed cortisone. His condition was diagnosed as incurable,
since it was doubted that the injury to his spine could be
corrected by an operation. RUIZ was further told that the
condition would continue to grow worse, and that within six to
ten years he would have a defective walk. RUIZ planned to send
the diagnosis and X-rays to ROA in Havana, who would pass them to
the Cuban specialist MARTÍNEZ-PAZ for review.
TRAVELS
33.
Following are the trips RUIZ is known to have made during
the last quarter of 1969:
-a.. To Bilboa, San Sebastian, and Burgos by car,
on 28 November 1969, returning two days later.
b.
☐ To Havana, to settle "a personal problem," on
20 October 1969 via Iberia (first class), returning to
Madrid on 29 October.
c.
To London on 14 November for consultations with
Raul LEON Torres, returning two days later by air.
d. To Italy with his family on vacation on 28 December
to pick up an Alfa Romero that he bought for the Embassy,
returning by car and arriving in Madrid on 6 January 1970.
CONTACTS IN MADRID
34. Little is known about RUIZ' contacts in Madrid. Aside
from the Algerian Ambassador (see above), we know about:
a. Pedro RUIZ. A good friend who goes to RUIZ'
home frequently. According to RUIZ, Pedro is quite
influential and is a friend of MASSO(?).
b. Carlos CARRASCO. Another person who calls
RUIZ frequently. In late October or early November 1969
CARRASCO went to New York.
c. Rosendo CANTO (201-749310). CANTO lives at Goya
54, Madrid. His friendship with RUIZ is interesting, given
CANTO's background, because their being together could be
very dangerous for RUIZ unless he were using CANTO for
some reason with the approval of Havana. CANTO wants to go
to Havana for a year, live there for a year, and then join the
Cuban Foreign Service. Referring to CANTO's desire, RUIZ
said on 8 January 1970: "He is a fool"
CHARACTER
35. Superficially, RUIZ scems to be an easy-going and rather
simple man who no doubt enjoys the prestige and position he has
and the successes he has had professionally in Spain. He appears
to have a strong character and probably plays the predominant
role in his marriage. He and his wife seem to get along very well

Cuban Charge d'Affairs Comments on
Czechoslovakian Situation
OSMA-25789, dated 7 January 1970
1. The following comments of the Cuban Minister to
Spain, Guillermo RUIZ Peres, reflect Cuban thoughts on the
Czechoslovakian situation:
The Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia has been
a disaster; however, criticizing the Soviet action
would mean taking sides with the Americans. A friend
may be criticized in private but publicly be should be
defended. (QUDOZE, 19 November.)
(QUDOZE, 19 November.) The Cubans have to
side with the Soviets for military and economic reasong.
and because, whether right or wrong, they belong to the
samo ideological group. Cuba had and still has enormous
discrepancies with the Soviet Union, China, and the United
States but weighing the differences Cuba is with Communism
and opposed to Capitalism. (QUDOZE, 3 November.)

1. Of possible interest to addressees is a translation of
the following letter dictated by Guillermo RUIZ Perez to his
secretory on 26 December 1969. The letter was addressed to a
comrade "OCUZA or LANUZA (fon)" in Havana in response to a confi-
dential note received by RUIZ from Havana.
F
"In relation to your confidential note number
7240 about the Spanish prisoners, Joaquin AUVI Casals,
Lazaro GARRIDO Sanchez and Antonio MARQUEZ Pedraza, whose
release was requested in a note from the Spanish Embassy
in Havana, I would like to tell you the following:
Firstly, Senor Joaquin AUVI Casals was of interest to:
D. Pedro SALVADOR de Vicente; but because of the bad
record and activities of this man, it was understood
that his departure would be denied. I talked to Pedro
SALVADOR about this matter and upon mentioning this
man's background he told me that his interest was due
to a phone call he had received from a friend of his in
Miami. He considers that, given the background in this
case, his friend was supposedly an instrument of "other
interests" Secondly, regarding the other Spaniards,
we have no objection whatsoever to their departing the
country. Without anything of further consequence,..
Station files contain no traces on AUVI, GARRIDO or

information on how these changes would affect the question
raised by Salvador or the signing of a new trade agreement
with Cuba. As of 17' November 1969. Salvádor was still
Special Delegate for Latin American Affairs.)
3. (Field Comment: Until recently, the indemnifications
and pensions problem had not emerged as a serious factor in
the negotiations for a new trade agreement. There has been
a gradual deterioration of Spanish-Cuban commercial relations
since the conclusion in May of preparatory negotiations for
a new agreement, but this deterioration ostensibly was the
result of a Spanish Government decision to reduce Cuban sugar
imports over the next three years. The Cuban Government
apparently had not considered such decision in its analysis
of Cuban-Spanish commercial relations, and it was quite
upset when the decision was revealed during the preparatory
negotiations. Some of the problems causing the strain in
Spanish Cuban relations were previously reported in

did not say what would happen if the Cuban Government failed
to reach some agreement on the question but he implied that

that her husband was a pilot and that she is a Spaniard,
adding she is not too old. R replies that in all honesty
he does not remember her. She insists on seeing him to
have a chat, and R suggests she come to his office at her
convenience. She prefers talking with him alone, without
his secretary or anyone else present, and suggests a bar
at some hotel like the Palace, Ritz or Hilton. He is
agreeable to any place she may desire; they agree to meet
that night at 9:30 in the lobby of the Hilton Hotel. She
will be dressed all in black.

The following comments of AMAUTO-1 reflect Cuban thoughts
on the Czechoslovaquian situation, internal Spanish politics,
and the effects of recent changes in the Spanish Government
on the impending trade negotiations between Spain and Cuba.
a. The Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia has
been a disaster; however, criticizing the Soviet action

defended. (QUDOZE, 19 November.). The Cubans have to
side with the Soviets for military and economic reasons
and because, whether right or wrong, they belong to the
same ideological camp. Cuba had and still has enormous
discrepancies with the Soviet Union, China, and the
United States but weighing the differences Cuba is with
Communism as opposed to Capitalism. (QUDOZE, 3 November.)
b. AMAUTO-1 was asked by his government to report
on the new Spanish Government which Havana calls "Opus
Dei". To a visiting Cuban official he admitted that
he was at a loss to understand Spanish politics but
attempted to define them. It is not true that the
Spanish Government is in the hands of the Opus Dei.
There are some men in the government who lean toward the
Opus Dei but there are others of a very different leaning
because they come from the Falangist ranks. These men
(the Falangists) may go along with the Opus Dei line
because they allow themselves to be "carried by the tide"
but they are not of the Opus Dei. (QUDOZE, 19 November.)

C.
Concerning the impending trade negotiations
with Spain, in addition to the economic problem the
Cubans are now faced with another impediment which
further delays the negotiations: the recent changes
in the Spanish government. It is difficult at this
time for the Cubans to approach any Spanish official
because of the climate of confusion among them. Most
Spanish officials have no idea as to whether they will
remain in their posts or will be replaced. Therefore,
it is futile for the Cubans to press them for action
on the negotiations. The most they can do is wait
patiently until the situation is normalized. If the
negotiations are not held within the 30-day expiration
period of the agreement, it is possible that the present
agreement can be extended for two months. This would
be advantageous to the Cubans because during the first
two months of the year they will be able to acquire all
the goods they will need for 1970. (QUDOZE, 19 November).

1. On 7 or 8 December 1989, Subject, who is the
Counselor of the Chilean Easy in Madrid, invited the
Cuban Charge, Guillon RUIZ Perez to a luncheon to meet
the wife (not identified by name) of Senator Salvador
ALLENDE who reportedly was passing through Madrid. She
arrived on the evening of 7 or 8 December and was to leave
(destination unknown) on 14 December. TELLO said that
RUIZ should meet ALLENDE's wife. RUIZ Commented that in
principal he envisioned no problem in moeting the woman,
but that he would confirm the invitation on 9 December.
TELLO went on to say that he invited a group of people
to the luncheon including Alfonso SASTRE and Fernando RIESTRA,
2. Station traces note that Alfonso SASTRE Salvador
was born on 20 February 1926 in Madrid, and is a graduate
of the University of Madrid in philosophy and letters. He
is a writer, anti-US and pro-Castro who participates in all
types of activities of the Communist "intellectual" elements.
His wife, Genoveva FOREST Turrat was arrested in May 1982
for participating in demonstrations, refused to pay the fine
and remained Encarcerated for 20 days. SASTRE visited Havana
on a number of occasions and reportedly was called to the
Cuban Embassy in Madrid in July 1968 to interview Haydee
SANTAMARIA.

1. Please cancel all clearances mentioned in Reference.
Since AMAUTO12's separation from AMAUTO-1's household and her
immigration to the United States with her husband, AMAUTO-5,
we no longer have an oporational interest in her. As you
know, AMAUTO-3 was used solely as an intermediary for a warm.
approach to AMAUTO-2. This was accomplished, and we have had
no further contact with her. No Station contact was ever made
with AMAUTO-4.
2: After the departure of AHAUTO-2 from AMAUTO-1's
household, the Station soon learned of her replacement and
this information was passed to the QUSEQUIN'S. It was decided
that the QUSEQUINS would attempt to recruit the new domestic,
but for unknown reasons, contact was never made. We believe
that there is a new domestic now working in the AMAUTO-1
household, but we have no details on her.

TRANSLATION:
Mr.
The study being made of the activities of Mr. Juan Torroba
and his (word indistinct), the lack of understanding and interest
on the part of (word indistinct), give us a direct insight into
the activities of the Spanish Embassy there (in Cuba) which could
be very useful to us in our relations (with the Spaniards). Defore
his arrival (in Havana) we tried to probe into the personality of
Torroba and, in addition to confirming the good opinion that
Spaniards have of him, we learned that he is weak in character
and that from this angle he could be influenced despite his
(word indistinct) personality. The position he held as Deputy
Director of Consular Affairs (in the Spanish Foreign Ministry)
was actually that of advisor on consular matters but he exercised
no authority. The idea of helping him in his work is apt and
could be carried to the point where some officer like himself
(of similar category) could intimidate him in such a way that
his weakness of character and susceptibility to outside influence.
would serve our purposes. There is no doubt that an attack
against Sr. Torroba in the way of making his task more difficult
would bring as an immediate result a greater influence on the
part of those who are interested in having him become a (word
indistinct). On the other hand we do not consider it possible
even in the event that his work should not prove to be the best,
that another officer could be substituted that (word or words
indistinct).
In order to resolve the question of handling from this
Embassy the departure of the (word indistinct), please clarify
the reason why there has been a misinterpretation. Everything
to the problems of Spain and Cuba through this Embassy will, of
course, redound to our benefit. A clear case is the application
for departure of (word indistinct) and his statement that perhaps
(word or words indistinct) since the Embassy in Cuba... (volume

Source has been successful in a modest building construction operation,
and appears to have access to investment funds. He is a new cource.
His cooperation is by way of a prominent US police official, long a
friend of his family.
A (US) friend of wine and I first ust Manual Tello, then Chilean Consul
General in San Francisco, late in 1963, probTy December, at the San
Francisco Preca Club. At that tire, Tello was accompanied by Beveral
attractive young women, one of whom was his daughter, Carmen. Tello
proved to be a gracious, polished diplomatic type and we all hit it
off well together. As & watter of fact, we hit it off to vell that fello
visited my friend's home from time to tire, managed to interest him in
a number of business ventures to be launched in Chile and later in Costa
Rica.
Tello was quite active in the San Francisco crel. Among his official
interests were the sponsoring of a thiles or pro-Chilean youth group,
and un attempt to organize a group of busintuen able to finance cou-
mercial ventres in Chile. Integral pus of his plans were the Alliance
for Proes funding and the recent California-Chile commercial and
cultural pPOHTAUS, Vontures were to include the construction of several
hunded sand dwellings in Chile, a commercial fishing venture, to be
baced a
que, establishment of a fish meal plant alco at Iquique,
and the acquisition of a huge ranch or finca near Puntarems in Costa
Rice.
Intter project, however, seemed more personally Tello's, ·
whereas in was to be but one of several other investors in the others.
...
3. As contas, went on, suspicions of illo's motives began to grow. Normal
‘avarice is easily understood, but 11 the course of visits to my friend's
hon: Tello began to hazard unsistibly unti-American expressions. He
were to learn that he was an attorney and had come from an old and wealthy
Chilean fauily, but was something of a blick sheep. He spoke or his
moth ' apologatic references to hin as "her Communist son". Tello

TELLO Troncoco, Manuel
CHILE
Sept. 14, 1955
The Subsecretary for Diplomitic Affairs of the Colombian Foreign
Office, Dr. Ricardo Araya, informed an Embassy officer on Sept. 12
that the La Republica article was accurate only insofar as it
reported that Ambassador Vargas had returned to Child. Dr. Annya
said that as far as he was aware Arhassador Vargas had gone to
¡Santiago to make final arrangements for the visit to Chile of the
Colombian War College, scheduled for September 14 to 29. The Chil-
can Embassy states that the Ambassador returned to Santiago accon-
panied only by his wife. First Secretary Sr. Manuel Tello Troacoco
is Charge d'Affaires ad interim.

emphatically that if by any remoto chrnce Allende were not to win, there
would be a revolution in Chile by November 1964. Tello claimed also that
he had visited several times with Raúl Castro, and had cct Fidel, all'
within the past year or so. He insisted that the US would recognize Cuba
before the end of 1964. Tello said also that he was on good terms with
important people in both the Soviet and Chinese Communist governments,
and that both nations were anxious to have him as Chile's ambassador,
but that he was not especially anxious to go. Another reference to
Communist China was the possibility that Chile might have, some small
cargo ships built there.
Tello!a pro-Command anti-American feelings were shared with his
daughter, Carmen who claimed to have been a youth ki leader in the
University of Chile. Another daughter, Patricia I believe her name is,
was said to be even more intensely anti-US. Either she or her husband
is connected with a Latin American organization, possibly the OAS of
Pan-American Union. Another daughter is married to the director of
personnel in the Fertica plant in Costa Rica.
5. At times, it was clear that Tello's averice transcended his concern for
the poor.
Once when another American suggested that the building of
the houses in Chile would give employment to many more Chileans if they
avoided use of pre-fab units and pre-cut timbers, etc, Tello was not
interested. He wanted to get in, get as much as possible, and get out
as soon as possible. At times he referred to plans to live in Europe
after he had made a few financial killings.
6. I have details on only one Chilean proposal, this a fish meal operation
known as Cachagua. It was formed within the past year with an authorized
capital of E850 thousand (approximately US$537,500), about half of which
was paid in. The prime investors were said to be Horst Barique Engeman,
Emilio Lannon Martinez, Gaston Pascal Leon, Cristian Casanova Subercaseaux,
and Gonzalvo Subercaseaux Canartu. Its main office is in Santiago; its
plant in Iquique. Somewhere behind the scenes was Tello.
17. Somehow. in a manner I do not pretend to understand, Tello really wanted
an American "front-can" in order to withdraw carnings in excess of what
the law permitted. His planning for an American's participation included
marriage to his oldest daughter, Carmen, who was later involved in a
shooting incident in San Francisco in June 1954, shortly after the
departure of her father to his new post in San José, Costa Rica, where
he is now Charge d'Affaires.

In Costa Rica, Tello seems to have considerable influence alco.
his schemes there is the acquisition or a huge ranch in the Puntarenas
area. The property, now Belf-supporting, lies between the Pan Ausricaa
highway and the Gulf of Nicoya. lic plans to develop it both for commercial
anu residential purposes with the operation, of a gambling sanctuary in the
to-be-established resort section.
9. Teilo'z successor as Chile's consular representative in San Francisco

At the time of the supposedly self-inflicted gun shot wound of Tello's
daughter, Carmon, Burr said, "This is an international incident. My

guess by this time that Bur was interested only in creating anti-US
ill will in Chile so as to enhance the election possibilities of Allendo.

They greet one another very cordially, and Ruiz thanks him
for sending the list. Terceiro asks how things were in
Havana. Ruiz says fine in every sense, and adds "they are
in the ten million ton harvest, now more than ever, as
we are hitting the 'cyclamates' where it hurts". Terceiro
aaks if you people paid for the campaign or not?" Ruiz
says no, that luckily it was the American Department of
Agriculture. He adds, "We have calculated that it will
leave us, free, approximately one million tons of sugar.
The price of sugar has reacted very well, and now a Sugar
Conference is to be held in Geneva. You know we are going
to get out propaganda now that will state "Only Cuban sugar
does not cause cancer". Terceiro laughs, and says some.

campaign has come at a perfect time for them because they
have been struggling for years with the Allegible; arti-

country that used it most.

Terceiro says that he has begun to study the famous issue
of the Chamber of Commerce. RAMON greets Ruiz and says that
he would like to take a book to him and also to talk to him
about a personal matter. It is in reference to a recommend-

are interested in going to Spain. Ramon continues, and says

The AMEDITS: have just completed the QUDOZE transcripts
for the period 19 September - 13 October 1969. This was the
second group of transcripts forwarded the AMEDITS for transla-
tion, per our trial period as mentioned in reference A, in order
to make them more fully useful to different components at Head-
quarters. The take from the QUDOZE operation appears very
'interesting. We noted with interest that AMAUTO-1 discusses freely
with his subordinates and privileged visitors subjects of a con-
fidential nature, including matters that have to do with intel-
ligence activities. Some of the discussions offer a number of
operational leads which we can follow-up, such as the medical.
information given on 22 September 1989 in the morning hours.
"
'
2. The AMEDITS have suggested that as an aid to help them
translate accurately and possibly more rapidly, they would
appreciate receiving some original tapes in addition to the trans-
cripts on a trial basis. Then when parts of the transcripts are
not understandable to the translator he would have readily avall-
able reference for replay.
3. With the next transmittal of the next QUDOZE material,
we would appreciate receiving both the transcripts prepared by
the station and the actual tapes covering the same period of
time. The complete package can then be forwarded to the AMEDITS
for their use as mentioned above.

Fidel's latest speech, published by Frensa Latina, was
distributed through the Embassy, but they got ild of the
copies and destroyed them. They say that leftist publications
praise whatever they want or whatever interests them, ond Fidel's
speech was of no interest to them, since they did not chalyze it
thoroughly.
She says that there is a latent revolutionary sentiment
throughout Europe. At the Sorbonne there are some powerful
centers where they compare the performance of the Chinese and
Asiatic outbreaks more than they do the Soviet ones.
This correspondent says that when she gets to Cube she
is going to visit FIDEL, because there is a trend of distrust
of Cubans throughout Europe, because they think that they receive
Information only through one chennel.
Upon hearing these somewhat anti-Soviet re arks on the
part of the correspondent, Ruiz interrupts her and says they

from the military and economic point of view, and also because
right or wrong they are on the same side of the fence and must
fight against those on the other side. Cuba has had, and still
has, great discrepancies with Russia, China, and the United
States. In the face of all these discrepancies we are on the
side of communism because we are against capitalism.
Ruiz says that in order to find out if you are a communist
you must ask yourself if you agree with distribution of wealth
and land, ocultable distribution of production, respect for man,
nationalization of industry. This is what ecunts.
At the end this girl says that the only truth is that

basic emotional instability. During public appearances he
displays polished manners and a pro-regime attitude; in private
he frequently complains to his subordiantes that he did not ask
for a diplomatic position, that he would prefer an industrial
job, and that he believes his position to be more a handicap
than a promotion. Secondly, he obviously desires personal
prestige and luxurious Hving. While these traits do not mean
so much in the case of a Cuban as compared to a Soviet or
Chinese, hardships and economic mismanagement in Cuba do in
fact create a contrast with his basic impulses. Thirdly, his
spinal ailment has been diagonsed as incurable. While this
may be true, he should realize that further examination by
other medical men (while on a training mission in WOLADY,
perhaps) could help him considerably. There may even be other
vulnerabilities which further target study could expose.
LA
5. We present these thoughts at the same time that we
are fully aware of other operational pressures on Madrid's
time and assets. Nevertheless, we would appreciate the Station's
comments on further development of AMAUTO-1 as an in-place
recruitment target. The first need would be the proper access
agent, someone with a Jesuit-like intellectual training who can
deal with him in the realm of concepts and philosophy as required.
In any case, we would like continued target reporting on AMAUTO-1,
as your time permits.

1. On 23 September 1969 AMAUTO-1 called an unidentified
Spanish woman who resided in Cuba for many years before re-
turning to Spain. AMAUTO-1 noted that he visited the Spanish
woman's cousin, identified as Esther CORRIPIO, while he vacationed
in PBRUMEN and found everyone in good health. The unidentified
Spanish woman asked AMAUTO-1 if there was much food available
and the following dialogue began:
AMAUTO-1: Yes, everything is being resolved.
But imagine to be free, one must pay
WOMAN:
AMAUTO-1:
a high price and the price must be
paid. There is no other way
What one wants, one must pay.
It is very logical, but look, when one
is a servant to the rich, the servant
usually lives relatively well, but the
servant continues as a servant. However,
when one no longer wants to be a servant
to the rich, one has to begin saving and
the only way there is for the poor to
save is to reduce (the intake) of essential
foods, change the essential and begin
to buy machines and to buy a series of
things (cuestiones) and one day, we will
· become rich together. We can say we are
rich when we have resolved all the problems,
not only material problems, but spiritual,
cultural, that is, when everyone can do
and believe as he likes.

ACTION.
See paragraph 5, below
"
1. Headquarters maintains its high interest in AMAUTO-1.
as a long-range, in-place recruitment target. Much of this
interest is kept alive by the excellent operational reporting
done by Station Madrid over the past year, of which references
C and D hereto are good examples.
2. Subject's position and total personality recommend
him to us as a high-potential target. He is strongly intel-
·lectual and emotionally committed to an ideal. At the same
time, he exhibts certain vulnerabilities which could be
exploited. We believe, however, that AMAUTO-1 could be
approached only in a classic sense: a rationally developed,
long-range recruitment culminating in what would be essen-
tially an intellectual and even ideological pitch. This
course of action would take time and assets, but we think
he would be eminently worth it.
3.
.
First, his access not only is good now but seems
destined to improve. Secondly, if he were our agent, he
has the wit and the acuity to know what we want and submit
information accurately based on requirements. Lastly, he is
a strong personality who could be counted on to move flexibly
but effectively within the target milieu.

2. We think the above is another good example of AMAUTO-1's
passion for the good life. While he appears patriotic and
openly supports the régime, we continue to believe that he would
prefer a return to the relative freedoms enjoyed by his country-
men before the start of the revolution.

Sonia's travel status.. During her stay in Spain, Sonia was in

married to one Miguel (LNU) and has a daughter named Iliana.
Sonia's mother is still living although appeared to be very
ill at the time Sonia left for her trip to Madrid because
Sonia cabled at least twice to Havana inquiring about the
Estatus of her mother's health. (TYLOTE reported that Sonia's
home phone number in Havana is 7-4263.) Perhaps Headquarters
can determine the full name of her husband by checking the..
reverse telephone listings: Sonia is attractive, intelligent,
sertious-minded and reserved. The last time she visited Spain
she stayed with Vera BORODOWSK 1. and was on the sane

Perhaps a relative's description of RUIZ
sums up his personality "a man of many
moods." He has variously been described
as intelligent, mentally alert, competent,
hardworking, and respected by his subordinates.
Pleasant, easy going, nervous, quick-tempered,
brusque but sincere, opinionated, strong-minded
idealistic, self-confident. Has basic.
emotional instability, gives impression
of being insecure in his position. At times
sarcastic, indifferent, egotistical, cynical,
serious, ungrateful and cold, who,
paradoxically, appears friendly to some people.
Outspoken, compulsive talker, articulate,

3. The purpose of Sonia's trip to Madrid was to discuss
the 1970 work pian for the Embassy with the Charge, Guillermo
RUIZ Perez. She also talked with the various Embassy officials,
most probably to familiarize herself with their duties and to
see if they had any problems. She pitched in and helped with
the backlogged work of Orestes BARREDA and Horacio
FUENTES and also helped with the cultural activities.
For instance, she sont two cables to MINREX - one regarding
the forwarding of movie posters for a March exhibit and another
regarding the forwarding of a Cuban stamp exhibition by end
March.
'
4 In their discussion of the 1970 work plan Sonia told
RUIZ that they were going to plan the February, March, and
April quarter. She showed him "an agenda for the control of
planned and unplanned activities" and the general directives of
the plan which included scientific information and political
information, with specific directives (requirements) for Spain.
RUIZ has to prepare for Havana a monthly report, then a quarterly
summary, of the activities accomplished. Based on these
reports the activities of the following quarter will be planned.
a. In line with the plan of scientific
information, Sonia and RUIZ discussed the pros
and cons of a Comite Cientifico-Tecnico which
is to be set up in Hadrid. RUIZ was of the
opinion that the local (Spanish) Communist
Party would try to infiltrate it and this
would bring problems to the Embassy. Sonia
pointed out the successes encountered in
Switzerland and Sweden with such a committee
even though at first there were problems
which were later overcome.
b. Sonia showed RUIZ a commercial project
which she planned to take to Portugal and
asked him to read it because it was also of
interest to the Cuban mission in Spain.
C. Sonia mentioned that the Plan of
Information was still to be completed especially
in the priority categories of livestock and
economy.
d. They turned next to the topic of
the budget. Sonia said that the budget
for each mission had to be submitted before
the end of April (every year) and no additional
expenditures could be submitted for approval
during the course of the year. Spain, Canada,
and France, however, would be treated individually.
Their special needs, such as acquisition of
more office space, raises in cost of living
allowances, etc., would be taken into consideration
at any time.

Orestes Guillermo RUIZ Perez
EDUCATION:
He can turn on considerable
charm, where motivated. In
contrast to his pleasant public
image and acceptable' language,
private conversation is vulgar,
swears continually and flies into
rages.
Likes good living and spends money
where it shows. Avid reader, keeps
abreast of world events, shows
willingness to accept whatever he
deems to be good or useful from
the outside world. Concerned with
the image and prestige of Cuba in
Spain. Emotionally committed to
an ideal. An AMEDIT study summed
RUIZ up as a realist. He speaks
English and French. His wife, a
teacher, always worked before going
to Spain, and there works as a
secretary and bookkeeper at the
Embassy on an informal basis.
intelligent, competent. outspoken
but solicitious and affectionate with
her husband; interested in, and.
encourages him in his work.
support the regime, but not a fanatic.
Appears to
RUIZ is the dominant personality of the
two.
Appears
One reference states that he went to
work at age 14, which suggests lack of
formal education.
In 1960 as an employee of the Ministry
of the Treasury, selected to attend
a statistics course offered by CEPAL,
which lasted two years.
One relative reported he completed
elementary education at "Hermanos
Maristas" school in Havana; did not
know whether he attended high school,
but said in early days of the Castro
regime attended the University of

Orestes Guillermo- RUIZ Pérez
POLITICAL
ATTITUDE:
:
U.S. 5 April 1957, overstayed
his time, and on 11 February 1958
was ordered deported; claimed he
would be killed if he returned to
Cuba and did not show for deportation.
Subsequent investigation showed he
was in Cuba as of 2 March..
-
A member of the Cuban Communist
Party, admitted on the recommendation
of Armando HART Davalos, Secretary
of Organization. Although he has
been described as a militant Communist,
a convinced supporter of the Castro
regime and a fanatic Fidclista, there
is evidence to dispute this image.
An analysis of available information
indicates that he is not a convinced
Marxist, he cannot accept Party
discipline, and that his character
is basically incompatible with the
system he serves.
His father is reported to be an old-
guard Communist and a leader of
the barber's union. A brother
reported to be a member of DSE in 1946.
He expressed dissatisfaction with
his position as a diplomat, feels
his talents are wasted and would like
a position in commerce or industry,
where he considers he could better
serve the revolution. Has criticized
the bureaucracy and inefficiency in
the government in Havana.
He has said that many Cuban diplomats
want to stay out of Cuba, but it
-
seemed to him that the Cuban government
wanted to keep him (RUIZ) out of the
way (i.c., outside Cuba). That LEON
had appointed him, supported him, and
they are good friends, but that he
(RUIZ) does not like to work with a
man who one does not get to know,
nor to know what he is thinking. He
said he felt as if he were in Miami.

In May 1964 AMMUG-1 reported RUIZ
was a DGI case officer in Mexico for
operations targetted against "some"
nearby area," and later identified
his photograph as DGI member in Mexico.
In 1961 an emigre said RUIZ, with the
Finance Ministry, was a Communist and.
G-2.
ANTIKI-1 said a letter from a friend .
in Cuba stated that RUIZ, then in
-
Mexico, was a member of G-2, sent to try
to infiltrate counterrevolutionary
groups (1963).
In April 1968, RUIZ advised Aristides
DIAZ Rovirosa on the use of disguises,
the need to "live secretly" and
commented on DIAZ' being "already
clandestine."
The Cuban Ambassador to Geneva, in
1968, commented on RUIZ' refusal to
accept DGI dominance of the Cuban Embassy,
Madrid. (AMDELAY-1). In July 1969,
AMBEDEW-1 said RUIZ was very dictatorial
in his dealings with DGI officers.
Not much is known of his contacts in
Madrid, other than official. Is in
touch with Ahmed LAIDI, Algerian
Ambassador; Manuel TELLO Troncoso,
Counselor of Chilean Embassy, Madrid;
Alexandru PETRESCU, Romanian Minister to
Spain and Carlos CARRASCO Munoz de Vera,

says that he hit five or six of the attackers. real hard, and
that he thinks he really hurt one of them quite badly around
the face and head. Everyone was covered with blood.
A woman and a man come into the office and talk about the
incident (above) also. Then the girl says that she has come
to Spain to take a course in Alcala. It seems that the course
is connected with UNESCO. She will later go to the University
of Santander and on to Paris to take a course there.

makes it difficult to carry on the Party life, but that never-
theless it is necessary to have group meetings to discuss the
members. She says that she would like to live in Madrid,
in a student residence, and commute to Alcala by car, or
bus every day. Ruiz says that in this way it would be more
economical for her and she would have more contact with the
other students. She says that she would like to be in
some Spanish-American college to get acquainted with the students
there. RUIZ says she could be very useful to them with her
student connections, and that without interfering with her
studies the can also be helping Cuba. He highly recommends
that she get every thing she can, culturally, during her stay in
Spain. He says that for very much she has read about museums
and historical and artistic places it is quite differant seeing
them.
Ruiz asks her to leave her address at the embassy so that the
President of the Women's Federation of the Party can take
advantage of her being of use to them in one way or another.
Ruiz tells her that anything that might happen to her to come
to the embassy and let them know about it. He says there is
the danger that they will spy on her or follow her and that
there is the possibility of enemies getting close to her.
He says that everyone makes mistakes and that if she does to
let them know at once so that they can prevent the consequence,
and give her good advice.
He has been out of the office for a long time.
At about 2:30 pm
he comes in with BARREDA and another person. Ruiz says that
he has to write to the Deputy Secretary(of Foreign Relations-?)

Interview with Alexander SAMKC.
SADIKO was contacted by phone (927-6721) of the nording of 21 April,
and he agreed to meet with "Joseph NORRIS, an official of the US
government," later the same morning at his home 1617 Roden Street,
Hollywood, Florida..
i
.
Se accepted my credentials without any reservations. He is a
✓ mucasian male in his 60s. He is of strong build; "white" gray
hair; small clear eyes which require thick glasses to read.
His
most distinguishing feature is large tatoo on his right forearm.
He had a loud booming voice, with a NY accent and although he does
not appear so have much of a formal education, he is articulate
and sociable.. He appears to be retired now and spends his days.
playing chess with business associate. He lives in a clean
middle class neighborhood and has a Lincoln Continental (about
3 or 4 years old) in the garage.
:
After speaking with him for over half an hour, SANKO does not
appear to know Crestes Guillermo RUIZ Pres. SAMKO Answered my
questions in a straightforward manner and I have no reason to
doubt his testimony. Specifically, these are the facts as
SANKO related them:
3.
C.
D.
The name Orestes Guillermo RUIZ Perez (it was typewritten on
a 3 x 5 card) means nothing to him. His business associate
-who has worked with him for many years and especially during
the 1950s- does not recall the name.
SANYO acknowledges that from c. mid 1953 till c. the end of
1959, he owned the "Pruit Center" -a grocery, meat market, and
fruit store on 100 SW 17th Avenue, Miami (one block from
Flagler Street). He does not recall that anyone in his
employ answered to the name of Orbsbes Cuillermo RUIL Pores,
or any combination of these names. He never had anything but
an impersonal employer/employee relationship with his personnel.
The last time he had been to Cuba was in c. 1948, "when I went
down from New York. He denied several times that he had been
to Cuba after Castro took power in 1959.
SARKO had bought the "Fruit Center" from ar. PNU WOODS,
who also owned the property in the vicinity of 100 SW 17th Avenue.
SAMKO dismissed the personnel WOODS had in the store when
he bought. He does not know the whereabouts of WOODS at this
time, but presumes he still on the property.
70
Naturally, SAMKO was curious to know why we were after E.
satify his curiosity and perhaps elicit some admission, in the
event he was playing games with me, I disclosed these bits of
information:

Castro took power in Cuba (c.1959), RUI had returned
to Cuba and there are reports that CANKO had visited RUIZ
in Cuba in 1959. And, further, "that SAMKO had offered RUID
a partnership in his store if I returned to the US.
.
QUIE was now the Cuban Minister to Spain and the GOUS was
interested in talking to his old friends to see what kind
of a person RCIE was. We had reason to believe that SAMKO
was an old friend of RUIZ
SAMKO listened intently. He seemed confused by all these reports.
He denied the allegations firmly, but without betraying any sign
of nervousness or doubletalk (as when one is telling less than
the truth.)
SANKO asked if we had a photo of RUIZ. He said he knew of no
other SAKKO in the Miami area, such as a brother, uncle, etc.
He did not appear to be bothered or inconvenienced by the
allegations, so if he was not telling the truth, he did a
wonderful job of it. The only thing he could suggest was to
locate Mr WOODS -the owner before him of the "Fruit Center"-
to see if He Had RUIZ as an employee.
In view of SAMKO's statements of denial, there was nothing more
to do than to thank him for his cooperation and say good morning.

1. On 16 April 1970 Stacy B. HARRIOTT had lunch with Subject
and Agustin GERVAS who are partners in Taller, S.A. The following
is HARRIOTT's report of that meeting:
"Subject, and GERVAS have joined with another
lawyer, fnu ITURRIAGA, to explore joint venture possi-
bilities in Spain. Subject and Iturriaga are law
partners with offices in Madrid. An assessment of Subject
based on such a short conversation would not normally.
be of much assistance but since Subject opened up on
his thoughts about Cuba, a general recommendation can
be reached.
B. "During the lunch I was able to work the
conversation around to the business potential for
Spanish and U.S. companies in Latin America. Avontu-
ally, we touched on Cuba, and Gervas said that Subject
considers himself to be an expert in this area as he
visited Cuba last year and had a private three-hour
interview with Fidel Castro. Gervas said that
Subject received a "snow job" from the jefe", and
this about sets the tone for his feelings for the
present Cuban regime. It was not clear how Subject
received an invitation to Cuba, but he said that

the Pegaso truck company

was not brought out. It seemed to me that Subject
is riding an emotional high for Cuba and Castro.
His face lit up and he became relatively excited
shen telling us how Castro mixes and talks with
the common people," and is from Spanish parents,
and has done so much for the country. I asked him
what his general impression was of life there and
ho replied phenomenal," and I believe he meant it.
C. 'S one comments that Subject made would appöar
to be inspired by Cuban propaganda or a briefing. He
said that JKLÁNCE 18 in control of U.S. internal
security and is forcing a rightest swing in its in-
ternal politics. Also, all people going to Cuba
from Mexico are photographed by JKLANCE people, while
if you go from Spain you don't rum
you don't run this risk.
-
D:
I asked him if there was good potential for
Spanish companies doing business with Cuba. He replied
that Cuba is a bridge to Latin America. This seezed
a strange answer, and I pointed out that you didn't
have to go to Cuba to get to Latin America.
He said,
that's true, but other countries will change to the
Cuban system and will need technicians to assist them.
Then we (Iguess he meant Spanish business mea doing
business with Cuba) will have excellent possibilities.
B.
"Subject said that he knew the Cuban Ambassador
to Spain and in fact visited him this morning and re-
ceived a large box of Havana cigars from him.
F. "Subject is about 30 years old, good looking
and makes an excellent first impression. He appeara
to have a good business background in addition to being
a trained lawyer. He seems aggressive, determined and
has a good imagination for business ventures.
G. "It would be premature to say that Subject leans
toward Communism or has been had by the Cuban I.S. I.
doubt that he would have talked so freely about his
admiration for Cuba if he is working covertly for them.
It is quite certain that he is being used by the Cuban
Embassy for commercial purposes, and I would estimate
that he would make an excellent "front man" for Cuban
business ventures,
☐ H. "I would recommend against trying to recruit
Subject as a means of getting to the Cuban Ambassador...
He would probably turn down the pitch and inform the
Cuban Embassy."
2. The above report is an excellent beginning in our asses8-
Dent of Subject and HARRIOTT must be commended for his adeptness
at steering the conversation toward the relevant areas of interest.
We think the report stands alone and requires little commentary by
the Station; however, we might add here that there is a strong
probability that Subject was indeed snowed under by the impact of
his alleged three-hour talk with Castro. Given Castro's charisma
and persuasive qualities it would not be difficult to "convince"
a young lawyer, alien to the Cuban environment, of the progress in
Cuba. Not withstanding HARRIOTT's fine report we feel that Subject
is still wallowing in the ebullience of this confrontation with
Fidel Castro. His short relationship with the Cuban Fabassy and
one visit to Cuba would hardly make him an authority on Cuba.

If you agree we would like to try another attempt to get
AN OSBORGMent of Subject. For days we have been trying to doviso
a cover story for a Station officer to use in an approach to Subject.
We have one and would like your comments, suggestions and ideas. A
Station officer, preferably in disguise and using an alias, would
approach Subject as a free lanco writer for "World Nows" (a
suggestion made by DCAMERA-1 because there are so many stringers
for "World News" that it would be virtually impossible to confirm)
with the intention that he is writing an articlo on Spanish lawyers
in business with the those that a degree in law offers greator
opportunities for advancement in business and government. (The
theme actually is taken from an article in Fortune or Business Week
magazine read by the undersigned some years ago). The theme was
tested on QUCAMERA-1 and he agrees that it is a good one and would
work because of the general nature of Spanish businessmen to like
to talk about themselves. What is involved however, is a consider
able amount of homework, narticularly in the collection of names of
lawyers in business who have been successful. QUCAMERA-1 is pre-
paring a list of such people and we will review them together.
undersigned subsequently will ask for Dun and Bradstreet reports on
The
the firms these lawyers represent as well as review the firms
financial history in our reference aids located in the Embassy's
commercial library.
<
•
4. The theme opens the door to a number of provoking questions,
but it particularly offers a good opportunity to assess the person-
ality of the target. Porhaps the opportunity will again come when
Subject discusses his relationship and knowledge of Cuba at which
time an interesting exchange might ensue possibly provoking Subject
to reveal his true relationship with the Cubans and/or his affection
for the Cuban system. No pitch would be made and, if after this
assessment, the officer arrives at HARRIOTT's conclusion, the
Station would recommend against using Subject as an intermediary
to AMAUTO-1.

Mr. JAVIER, from the Casa Conde of Vigo, calls HORACIO
to say that they have had in Vigo for two months the
ship VIA JAIBA (ph) for repairs and the captain has
decided that it is best if the crew takes its month
of vacation now and return later to the ship in Vigo.
J adds the captain has to return to Cuba on Friday by
CUBANA, but he has no visa and authorization must be
requested from the General Department of Security. HORACIO
takes down the captain's name: Eugenio LEOPOLDO PORTAL
y PEÑA, Passport No. 038-534, issued 12 September 1969,
Havana.
Nilda RUIZ calls Alicia FRANCO to instruct her that should
someone go by claiming to be a relative of hers to say she
has no cousins or relatives of any sort. AF tells her
that person went by the Consulate the day before claiming
to be her cousin and saying he was a Spaniard. NR contends
she cannot imagine where he got that notion because she
has no cousins, adding that her cousins are Catalonians
and not from Gijón. AF says the man who came to the
Consulate saying to be her cousin resembles NR, and describes
him as having blue eyes, sort of blond, and tall.
says it is an older married couple. According to NR,
She then'
her family comes from Catalonia.

AF repeats this is an older
married couple and their problems cannot be solved by the
Consulate, rather they must be resolved there (in Cuba?)
as man.

ANCACTUS as broad and florible as operationally possible,

11. The PERUMEN Government has approved the construction
of a new official installation in Redrid which is expected to
be completed within one year. The Station is actively pursuing
this matter with the intention to install various audio devices
in the new building. There will be a number of barriers to
overcome since the INRUHENS appear to want the building con-
structed by their own team of workers. The Station expects
to work closely with QUINN in this operation. (Bee OSHA 26040,

Hould appreciate our comments
in turn. Ils return for an
Lotes
1.
Now that ALANTC-1 is scheduled to go back to Cuba in mid-year, it is
a bit late to begin the recruitment of an intermediary. we have information that
he intends to go back to MININT rather than MIRKEK or even HINCEK, which makes the
likelihood of his coming out again somewhat slimmer to say the least. I'm afraid
that, although we have time only for a reasoned quick a;proach, this type of ap-
proach might lose him to us for good.
2.
This causing him to become suspicious is not quite what we had in mind
when we wrote ref B. o made, 1 think, a rather strong case for laying cards on.
the table with ALAUTO-1, and a slow development by a senior staff officer seemed
to emerge from the possibilities. We even suggested how it might be done (through
the gymnasium). That might be impossible, but the validity of the approach should
deserve a comment.
3. An intermediary would be an access agent, so certainly he should be
responsive. I can't consider this point to have any additional bearing on the
matter. Of course it will be difficult, and I'mglad they're prepared to work on
it.
4.
I'd like to have had a chance to review the Dun & Bradstreet file on
Carlitos, even tho the PCA has gone forward. CORRECTION: we have it.
5. A joint operation (income ways) is the easy way out. We simply did not
get started in time
6. I disagree, because the question of commitments is somewhat premature,
but I'd be willing to push for 750-1,000 a month while working in place, with a
bonus when he does come out. For defection outright, which is a poor second, he
might even be worth work to resettle him here. LBGA 19006 reported a 1964 attempt
to get at Mrs. MAUTO-1's relatives in Miami, and they might still be there. hero
haps they would sponsor. Everything, but everything depends on initial approaches
and debriefings.
7. There are a lot of unanswered questions, rosed in the outgoing, and I'd
have a preciated a word about them: we have answered this one, we are working in
tal manner on that one, etc.
a.
b.
The construction work on the new Embassy. There is a separate
dispatch on this so all is on wheels.
The lonely automobile trips deserves locking into. No comment
in the incoming.
etc.
In any case, they're on it, so I want to encourage as much as possible.
Pls tube back (D-3) when you're hind a chicuccti

.1. There is little we can contribute to the exceptionally
fine reports submitted by Headquarters on AMAUTO-1. His
character, personality, physical and mental capabilities,
and to some extent even his vulnerabilities, are succinctly
outlined in your reports. In addition, you have appropriately
recognized the Hurculean task we have, to overcome his strong-
mindedness and idealistic character.
'
2. After a series of discussions among the officers
involved with PBRUMEN operations at the Station, we have
concluded that to execute a logically developed "traditional"
recruitment, we are faced with the challenge to recruit a
person, an intermediary, in whom AMAUTO-1 has confidence and
respect; an individual who is able to plausibly carry on a
polemic argument with AMAUTO-1 without either antagonizing
him or causing him to become suspicious of the intermediary's
true role. Moreover, the intermediary must be intelligent
to be able to respond in an appropriate way to our instructions,
as well as show a genuine willingness to cooperate. Frankly,
we have no such person, currently on our list of assets and
to find someone with the attributes set forth in Reference A
will be difficult to say the least, but we are prepared to
work diligently on this problem.

From our reading
We can
of QUTINID and QUDOZE; there are at least three persons
who could logically and effectively fill the role as an
intermediary. They are Identities A, B, and C.
categorically eliminate Identity A for obvious reasons, i.c.,
lack of direct access to him. Because of his relationship
to Identity D, we can also tentatively eliminate Identity B.
He presents a risk which we are not certain should be taken;
however, we would like to add a comment on him in a later
To
paragraph. Identity C: would seem to be the most logical
choice. He is intelligent, a professional man, well-to-do,
young and one with whom AMAUTO-1 frequently talks and whom
he often sees. We know little about his political proclivities
although he gives the impression of being a moderate analyst
of world events and doesn't seem to have a strong affection
or aversion for the PBRUMEN Government. We have a good
background on him prepared for us by Dun and Bradstreet;
however, as you can well imagine, the report concentrates on
the economic side of the individual. We have made a number
of attempts here in the Embassy to determine whether he has
any American contacts, but with negative results: His visa
file does not show where he visited in the United States or
the purpose, except that it was a business trip. He has an
indefinite visa and we are fairly certain that, if necessary,
we could use the question of his visa as an entree to him.
We are currently reviewing with all Station assets their
knowledge of Identity C. In addition, we are also considering
assets such as QUCASH-1 and QUSPOT-1, who could, under some
○ legitimate business pretext, contact Identity C. Our objective
is to develop a warm entree to Identity C without compromising
any of our agents, but we are in need of an assessment of
Identity C by either a Station Officer or an asset working
under an officer's instructions. We will keep you advised of
our progress. We are forwarding PRQ Part I under separate
cover. A POA on Identity C was requested separately.
are no derogatory Station traces.
There
4. Identity B would be an excellent choice if not for
his relationship with Identity D. This avenue might be explored
with QUSEQUIN-48 if Headquarters is agreeable to a joint
operation. QUSEQUIN-48 could probably get the necessary
clearances from Identity D directly, or from one of Identity D's
aides, to contact Identity B. We will not pursue this until
we receive your comments.
5.
It is not too early to consider the emoluments we
might want to offer to AMAUTO-1 at the time a pitch is made.
As always they should be divided into two areas for defection
and for recruitment and work in place.

DRYBAT TYPIC TECHS/Construction of New PBRUMEN Embassy
ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES
Reference: OSMA 24774
The PBRUMEN government has approved the construction
in Madrid of a new office building to be used as an Embassy,
Commercial office and residence for the PBRUMEN Minister
The site has been identified and work is expected to begin
soon, probably after the return of AMAUTO-1 from PBRUMEN,
sometime within the next two weeks. The builders expect to
complete the building within eight months.
2. QUSEQUIN-37 is far more confident than we are, about
the possibility of getting access to the building during the
construction phase to possibly install various audio devices.
We believe this operation to be a formidable one and we might
be challenged by the presence in Madrid of PBRUMEN security
forces overseeing the construction, the presence of PBRUMEN
electricians and other professions, complicating the access
to the building. We believe AMAUTO-1 has the Romanian
experience well in mind and most likely will do everything
within his power to overcome the possibility of an audio
penetration of his building.
3. He would be grateful for any information addressees
might have on the general modus operandi of PBRUMEN security
forces in areas where PBRUMEN official installations have been
constructed. Have they used PBRUMEN technicians, electricians,
construction engineers, etc? Also we would like to know whether
the PBRUMENS have installed their own telephone system or have
they generally relied on the system of the host country. We
would appreciate too, any comments Headquarters or
other addressees would like to make on the best
course of action for the Station to consider. QUSEQUIN-37
believes he can get a copy of the blueprints after the plan

According to QUTIMID on 26 February, Miss SUAREZ
de Cepeda of the Grolier Company called AMAUTO-1 and spoke
with his secretary to explain that her company is giving
their book to a number of persons in order to obtain their
opinions about the product and AMAUTO-1 was one of the persons
on Grolier's list. AMAUTO-1's secretary said that he would
call when he returned. Later, Miss SUAREZ was told that an
appointment was made for 10 March.
2. This would appear to be a routine item which
probably would not merit further investigation, unless we
can discover someone of higher caliber in the Grolier Company
who could approach AMAUTO-1 as a means of cultivating a mean-
ingful friendship with AMAUTO-1.
