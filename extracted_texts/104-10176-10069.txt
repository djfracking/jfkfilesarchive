MEMORANDUM OF CONVERSATION between
Andrew St. George CBS photographer.
William G. Bowdler.
SUBJECT:
Invasion of Haiti
33
Andrew St. George called me from Mami.
He said that he and the CBS film crew, headed by a Mr. McMullin
(phonetic), were back in Miami to cover the departure this weekend
of the expedition which Rolando Masferrer_was organising to invade
Haiti. St. George claimed that Masferrer had recruited 300 men and
marranged for the use of one B-19, two C-46s and a large boat. He
said that all the preparations were so much in the open that it was
evident that Masferrer and his Haitian colleagues had received the
"green light". Recent events in Haiti, plus Masferrer's activitins.
were attracting a lot of newamen to Miami.
I told St. George that he was mistaken about the "green light"." We
will not telerate vislation of our neutrality laws. Our enforcement
Agencies, whose duty it is to enforce these laws, will not permit
what he describeú taking pizce. I wanted him and those with whom
he was dealing to be clear on this point. He said he would inform
Mr. McMallis.

Spanish, and has many social and business contacts in the Lominican Republic.
[This report was developed by a Navy representative assigned to the office of
preparation.]
On 28 Oct 66 I spoke with Rolando Masferrer Rojas, a Cuben exile, and he told
me that he has organized a military force of approximately 250 men to invade
Eaiti. The invasion force consists of Cuban and Haitian exiles residing in
the U3, the Bahamas, and the Dominican Republic. The invasion will probably
be launched from the Dominican Republic sometime between 5 and 13 November
and the target is Port-au-Prince. The invasion force will strike in the
early hours of the morning selected. It is well armed, and will have air
cover; the presidential palace will be bombed.
Masferrer stated that Bigene L. Maximilien, Haitian Commil in Miami, Florid:
is aware of the invasion, but he has no knowledge of the invasion date.
Maximilian is presently in Haiti informing President Drvalier that the invasion
can be prevented by paying off $200,000 to Masferrer. Nellion will return
to the US on 3 November and he has agreed with Masferrer that if Luvalier
agrees to the pay-off, Maximilien will receive $50,000 and Masferrer $150,000.
Kasferrer told me that the invasion will take place in any event and the
$150,000, if received, would be used to further support the invasion.
Masferrer stated that be met within the past 10 days with several dissident
Haitian amy officers and be had received their syport, Ze. Enitian army
officers told Masferrer that they would revolt as soon as informed that the
scop
invasion had commenced. They do not know that the target will be Port-Qu¬
Prince; they believe that it will be in the cap Esition area,

Masferrer stated that he was confident that the invasion will micceed, and is

THIS AS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION, SOURCE GRADINGS ARE DEFINITIVE. APPRAISAL OF CONTENT IS TENTATIVE,
Former Latin American diplomat who maintains relations with officials of
Latin American countries. Source is a trained reporter and his inform
tim has been reliable in the past. He obtained this information from
Aurea Esther Poggio.
On 21 September 1967 in Miami, Florida, Aurea Esther Poggio,
Cuban emigre who is a secretary to Rolando Masferrer Rojas.
said that plans had been made to assassinate persona linked
with revolutionary movements in Miami opposing President
Francois Duvalier of Haiti. Poggio said that the first such
attempt was against Julio Aton Constanzo Palau on 17 September
1967.
2. Poggio said that Masferrer's group was investigating the
matter in an effort to find out who was carrying out the
assassination plans for Duvelier.2
Field Comment: Constanzo, Cuban emigre, was among those indicted
vith Masferrer, former Cuban senator, and Father Jean Baptiste Georges,
Haitian emigre, by a federal grand jury in Miant in February 1967 —
charges of conspiring to launch an invasion of Haiti from the Florida
Keys. No coverage of an attempt to kill Constanzo has been noted in
the local press.
.20 Headquarters Comment: According to TDCS-314/08728-67, about miá-
1957 Duvalier instructed Andre Elie, Haitian Consul in New York, t
keep close surveillance on Haitian exiles and to report all plans
for invasions of Haiti.

Assistant Attorney General

Washington, D. C. 29530
Dear Walt:
After you informed me on 29 November 1966 of the
possible indictment by the U. 5. Attorney in Florida of Rolando
Masferrer and others concerned in the plan to launch an expedition
from Florida against President Duvalier of Haiti, I asked for a
report on our knowledge of, or involvement in, this activity.
As you know, we have installations in the Miami area
which utilize a variety of sensitive covers. The Chief of Station
coordinates his activities closely with the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and
the Bureau of Customs of the Department of the Treasury and
disseminates these offices in the ares pertinent intelligence
information.
Our Station was well informed on the plans of Mammorrer
and his coberts and disseminated this information in the normal
manner. Part of this reporting included informatica that Masferrer
and some of his ancscintes repeatedly hacerted that their pistting
had been approved by the U. S. Government. On some occasions
they stated this approval came from this Agency, and the other
times they intimated that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had
Spproved their actions. These claims were apparently used to
persuade various persens, primarily Cuban exiles, some of whom
formerly had contact with the Agency, to jeźn the plot. It appears
logical to assume that Masferrer would continue to claim, that be
had received what he interpreted to be U. §. Government approval
of the scheme to overthrow President Devalier, and if he has

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Liaison Meeting with FBI New York Agent Frank O'Brien
1. At 1500 hours on 13 September, Ken Millian and I
met with FBI Cuban specialist Frank O'Brien at a cafe/coffee
shop at 72nd St. and 3rd Ave., two blocks away from the Bu-
reau's New York headquarters. 1 had arranged the meeting by
telephone from Washington and advised C'Brien that I wanted
to review and coordinate a number of items with him. I also
informed him that I would be accompanied by Millian, a col-
league interested in the Cuban UN Mission.
.
mar
.

2. The meeting opened at an easy pace with an uninhib-
ited review of happenings of mutual interest: O'Brien noted
that in his view the Cubans at the Mission had been relative-
ly inactive and had not recently been involved in subversive
activities of any magnitude. He reviewed FBI coverage of as
yet not fully explained purchasing activity by Mission per-
sonnel which included procurement from various New York area
military surplus cutlets of ponchos, leggings, and other.
and
similar equipment. He implied that in the process of cover-
ing the activities, the Bureau had acquired a substɔntial
amount of surplus equipment itself but he didn't provide de-
tails and we didn't pursue the matter.
A
3. He noted that blanket Bureau coverage of the activ-
ities of Rolando Masferrer was continuing and that he occ2-
sionally talked with Masferrer by telephone or in person.
He indicated that the Bureau was intimately aware of efforts
on the part of Masferrer and other Cubans both in New York
and Florida to procure arms in the U.S. and position them ir.
the Dominican Republic. He reported that an attempt to move
a shipment of such arms from the Florida Keys to the D.R..
currently was underway and that the U.S. Customs Service was
alerted to move in at the appropriate time to confiscate the
material. (Although acknowledging Masferrer's gangster back-
ground, O'Brien complemented him on his intelligence and ef-
ficiency and indicated that Masferrer was one of the ablest
Cuban refugees he had net.)
O'Brien also surfaced his current contact with for-
mer Rebel Army Captain Raimindo F. Antonio de la Torre v

theory, O'Brien said absolutely not, it was pure speculation.)
7. O'Brien checked the Bureau's New York indices on
NEKNIFE Lut without success. If he was in fact interviewed
by the FBI in New York there apparently was no record of
it. I told him that NEKNIFE was expected in New York City
in late September to visit his daughter and son-in-law and
that we probably would attempt a meeting with him at the time.
He had no objection.
Specific items of business concluded, we moved into
a general and historical discussion of the Cuban Hission to
the UN, which was the main purpose of Millian's attendance
at the meeting. Recent changes in Mission personnel, includ-
ing the assignment of Ricardo Alarcón Quesada (201-347590)
as Ambassador, were discussed and itineraries of Cubans ar❤
riving for the General Assembly were noted. Early in the
conversation, C'Brien surfaced his long term contact_with
Cuban UN Advisor and Alternate Representative Antonio de Souza
Carvajal (201-354048), a friend of Cuban Foreign Minister
Raul Roa, who has served the Cubans in New York for the past
ten years or more and has been with the Cuban Foreign Ser-
vice for 40 years.
The Souza subject was not new to me, since
O'Brien had brought it up in conversations I had with him
earlier this year. I did not choose to pursue the subject
with him at that time, however, without first reviewing all
implications of the case with Agency officials in Washington.
O'Brien indicated no interest in Miguel Juan Alfonso Martínez
(201-354041), Counselor at the Mission, whom we suspected
they might be in contact with.
9. O'Brien's eagerness to discuss the Souza matter
seems to imply that he is deeply interested in it and may
suggest that he is not satisfied with results thus far ob-
tained. At one point he indicated that his headquarters was
not at all happy with the take from Souza. He reviewed the
history of the contact with complete candor beginning with
his initial contacts with Souza in the mid/late 1950's when
O'Brien had open access to the Cuban Mission in New York
and was a frequent visitor there. From his description, Souza
would appear to be a thoroughly experienced and skilled
diplomat who has survived the numerous changes in the Cuban
goverment because of his friendship with Roa and other in-
fluential Cubans, and because of his ability to implement
effectively for the Cubans the more subtle diplomatic maneu-
vers required by membership in the UN community. In fact,
O'Brien feels that the Cubans utilize Souza exclusively on
these latter duties and tend to exclude him from high level
matters involving political, military, or economic policy.

De la Torre apparently is involved with Cuban refugees in
the U.S. who are attempting to re-establish the 26th of July
Movement here in the United States minus the Communist im-
plications contributed by Fidel. O'Brien apparently is im-
pressed with De la Torre's sincerity and ability and belicves
that De la Torre should be of interest to us. De la Torre
has until recently stayed away from exile activities and ac-
cording to O'Brien is pushing the revitalized 26th of July
idea by personal contact rather than make any splash. Ac-
cording to O'Brien De la Törre is now operating a successful
painting business and at one time held a good position with
Union Carbide International. In conversations with O'Brien
a De la Torre has been critical of CIA. When queried O'Brien
indicated that De la Torre's only real gripe was the Bay of
Pigs. (C/O note: We should look into De la Torre to see if

evaluate information available to us and discuss De la Torre
with him again in the future.
5. Note: O'Brien has been working the Cuban target in
New York for over ten years and is impressively conversant
with the subject. It is, therefore, sometimes difficult to
stay with him wher. he covers various complicated subjects
with abbreviated statements, e. g., during subject meeting,
the alluded to one Miguel Morales, the former husband of Nellie
Barletta, daughter of Batista's ambassador to Argentina
Anleto Barletta. He apparently feels there may be mileage
"in Morales. We will, therefore, review Morales, Barletta,
Het al, and resurface the subject with him when time permits.
6. The two principal action items on my agenda were
the coordination of my planned luncheon meeting with photo-
journalist Lee J. Lockwood (201-78771), and discussion of
NEKNIFE, who allegedly was interviewed by the Bureau in New
York several years ago. O'Brien advised me that he had re-
viewed their Lockwood file and talked with the Bureau agent
responsible for the Lockwood "case". He stated that he had
not uncovered any derogatory information on Lockwood and saw
no reason to prevent my meeting with him. I told him I would
advise him of my meeting arrangements with Lockwood when they
were firm and that I would brief him after the meeting was
over. (It is of interest to note that during my briefing
of O'Brien on the morning of the 16th, the day following my
luncheon with Lockwood, O'Brien noted that some of his supe-
riers in Washington thought Lockwood was an opposition (sic)
"spy". When I asked if there was anything to support this

14. Without prompting, O'Brien surfaced the AMBIG-3
double agent case. He noted that he had been involved to a
degree and actually was present at the hotel bar in downtown
New York when the agent made his meet with the Cuban case
officer. O'Brien, accompanied by at least one other Bureau
man, reported that AMBIG-3 winked at them while passing close
by them at the bar on one occasion. O'Brien took this to
mean that AMBIG-3 presumed that O'Brien and his friend were
Bureau men assigned to surveil the meeting. O'Brien also
stated that after his meeting with his Cuban DGI´ contact,
AMBIG-3 called for an emergency meeting with the Bureau and
they gave him $290.
15. It was close to 2000 hours before our meeting ter-
minated. We parted on a cordial note with agreement reached
that we would talk soon again when some of the material
discussed had been further sifted.

This, according to O'Brien, accounts for Souza's inability
to provide information of real value. O'Brien did indicate,
however, that the usual P.I. requirements had no punch. He
cited, for example, the requirements after Souza's return
from Hawaii, which in effect amounted to: What's new?
10. Despite the long history of the Souza contact,
O'Brien is not now meeting with Souza in person. Souza feels
that O'Brien is too well known in the Cuban community in
New York and even the most elaborate contact arrangements
would not be free of danger. Souza also shys away from talk-
ing on his home phone for fear that it may be tapped. O'Brien
can, however, telephone Souza and lay on alternate telephone
or even meeting arrangements. We did not establish the fre-
quency of G'Brien's current contacts with Souza nor did wė
establish at what point in the history of the contact the
decision was made to dispense with personal meetings; the
nature of our meeting with O'Brien did not permit elaborate
and detailed questioning. He did recount, however,`an¨in-¨
teresting aspect of the case which followed from the fact
that a State Department security officer assigned to New York,
(fnu) Swazey, occupied the apartment directly above Souza
during his tour in New York and became quite friendly with
Souza. O'Brien apparently used Swazey as an informal go-
between, on the case. (Should we choose to pursue the Souza
lead, an attempt perhaps should be made to locate and debrief
Swazey with O'Brien's concurrence. Note: This could be
Anthony Clinton Swezey, DOB 9 August 1913, who was Special
Assistant to Secretary General of U.S. Mission to UN 1946 to
1947. In 1963 he was First Secretary, FSO-2, in Paris.)
11. It is difficult at this point to identify with ac-
curacy the true nature of O'Brien's tie with Souza. Based
upon O'Brien's comments, it does not appear that Souza should
be classified as an "agent" of the Bureau in the classical
sense, particularly at this point when there apparently are
no formal arrangements for contact, no remuneration or even
instructions given, and apparently no reports received from
Souza. It is probable that a critical point in this opera-
tion was reached about three years ago when, according to
O'Brien, Souza talked about his advancing age (now 65), his
retirement equities with the Cuban government, and his fi-
nancial needs in general. O'Brien thought that Souza was
looking for guarantees which would provide for his future
should he choose to cooperate fully and ultimately be sur-
faced and forced to forego his retirement and remain in the
U.S. O'Brien apparently presented Souza's case to his supe-
riors but was unable to generate any substantial enthusiasm.
He stated they were not willing to give Souza a stipend. The

Bureau's position, both then and now, apparently is that
Souza has little potential as an asset for internal security
matters and therefore would not justify any substantial fi-
nancial obligation. In very low key, it was made clear to
O'Brien that the Agency was interested in Souza's Positive
Intelligence potential (his access in Havana should be good,
given his long friendship with Roa and his closeness to
Maria Celia Girona Fernández (201-327421), cousin of Celia
Sánchez Manduley) and well might find justification for pro-
viding modest security for Souza's old age.
12. Throughout our conversation it appeared clear that
O'Brien was of the opinion that there may be a role for the
Agency in the Souza operation. We asked him, therefore,
whether or not he felt: Souza may still be interested in feath-
ering his nest and, if so, if it would be bureaucratically
possible to get word to Souza that such a possibility existed.
O'Brien felt that Souza, would still be interested and he
was of the opinion that he could get the point across to
Souza via double talk in a telephone conversation. This ap-
proach was accepted and it was agreed that O'Brien would ad-
vise us of the results after the call was made. If prospects
appeared encouraging, it was agreed that we would then get
together again to discuss the next step which might entail
arranging direct contact with Souza. O'Brien noted that
Souza lives in Jackson Heights and usually drives to work.
Possibly a contact could be arranged somewhere along the route.
The foregoing generally covers the extent of our discussion ·
regarding Souza. When I met with O'Brien again on 16 Sep-
tember just prior to my departure for Washington, I requested
that he not take any action on the Souza case in our behalf
until he heard something further from re.
13. During our meeting we reviewed other members of the
Cuban Mission with particular reference to EGI types. O'Brien
noted that Chafik Homero Saker Zenni (201-335014)" undoubted-
ly is the senior member of the DGI group but even so he was
not thought to be particularly active. He reported that
Saker had been in contact with Lee Lockwood (see above) on
several recent occasions but nothing was known of the nature
of the meetings. He also noted that the Bureau was in con-
tact with Saker's Cuban girl friend in New York City whom
they had just traced without surfacing any derogatory infor-
mation. She is cooperating and the Bureau is optimistic
about her potential. He did not provide the girl's name but
indicated that we should hear about her shortly through chan-
nels. O'Brien also acknowledged that the Bureau has a pene-
tration of Prensa Latina in New York. He did not provide the
name or any details but on the basis of his comments we pre-

MEMORANDUM OF CONVERSATION
September 6, 1966
SUBJECT: Andrew St. George -- free lance photographer now working
with CPS
Mr. St. George came to see me at his request. I have known him from
the time that he wear to Cuba in the late fifties to film the Castro move-
ment.
He said he wanted to see me as an old friend to tell me that [CES is film-
ing a story of gun-running from the U.S. to the D.R. for use against Haiti.]
He is working with the CBS crew.

Mr. 2. George said that the CBS teera had[completed its filming in Miami
and in the near future would be travelling to Santo Domlage to film the
operation at that end] He claimed that in Miami Rolando Masferrer and
Mitchell Warbel (phonetic) had permitted him to film what ke described
as a large arsenal in Masferrer's house.)
In response to my question about the identity of Warbel, he said that he
is a soïdiez-of-fortune arms merchant type from Atlania who is working
with Maierrer in the acquisition of arms. St. George claimed that Warbel
had been responsible for the seizure of Manuel Kay's vessel “Vezas” in
the Dominican Republic and the acquisition of the arms (mostly sub-machine
gums) which were ca board.
£2. Cessus stated that the base in the Dominican Republic was on Beata
Island. Arrangements in the DR are being handled through Santiago Rey
with Martires Araña and others whom be dia not name. St. George said
that Erlaguer had given his nod to the operation. I told him that I did not
believe there was any truth to this latter point as President Balaguer has
recezdy normalized diplomatic relations with Haiti and is not interested

nothing more positive he can take the approach that he considered
the U. S. Government tacitly approved his plot since it obviously
• know about it and did not take any action against him.
For the record, it can be flatly stated that neither by
statement nor by implication has the Central Intelligence Agency
indicated to anyone that it approved or was supporting the plot.
On the contrary, those who queried people they knew were con-
sected with our Agency concerning possible participation in the
plot were told that it had no U. 8. Government backing whatsoever.
Some of the plotters attempted to contact this Agency through
various intermediaries, and the intermediaries were told that the
Agency wished to have nothing to do with the undertaking and that
any information concerning violations of U. S. laws should be
passed to law enforcement agencies, particularly the Bureau of
Customs and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Technically,
therefore, the Agency has stayed cicar of the plotters, and we
would be in a position to state that we had no connection with the
plot and had given it no encouragement or backing of any sort.
As a prectionl matter, however, if prosecution were
pursued, Masferrer, and perhaps other defendants, would probably
claim that they had CIA backing and some might even believe it to
be trus. This might well lead one or more defendants to seek
sukpossa duces tecum for an Agency witness and the Agency
documentation on the subject. As noted above, the witness can
tentify to the fact that the Agency had in no way participated or
encouraged the activity. If it proved impossible to quash the
requirement for production of documents, however, we would be
faced with a situation where we would almost certainly have to
claim the documents were privileged ca the grounds of security.
Aside from the sensitivity of the reports and their possible
compromise of sources, we would have the problem of identification
of our persenzel under cover and of protecting the sensitive cover
arrangements.
The same is true to a lesser extent of action against
Masferrer in connection with violations of his parole. In view
of the flagrest and numerous violations which were actually
known to and reported by Government agencies without say
punitive action resulting, it would appear that he could make a
plausible cizim that the Government had at least winked at, if

MEMORANDUM
SUBJECT: The Activities of Rolando MASFERRER Rojas
1.
Reference is made to a memorandum from this office,
Bubject: Plot to Overthrow Haitian Government, dated July
6, 1966, concerning a visit to a farm in the Atlanta, Georgia
area by an informant who witnessed the loading of arms at
the farm for shipment to temporary cache sites in homes
in Kiami and Coral Gables, Florida; the pickup of arus
from these homes; their transfer to small boats already
on trailers; and the offloading of latter at Miami River
docking sites for shipment to Santo Domingo and ultimate
sites on the Haitian Coast. While the information below may
not be related to the incident reported in reference, the
similarity of the two reports merits attention.
2. A friend of Rolando MASFERRER Rojas told a usually
reliable source of this office that on 27 June 1968
MASFERRER went to a house in Miami where 200 firearms were
stored. He was accompanied by two American newsmen, one of
whon was a photographer. The arms were removed from the
premises by agents of MASFERRER whose faces were covered.
The American photographer took photographs during the
removal of the arms.
3. The same usually reliable source of paragraph two
reported in conjunction with the above that as of early
July 1966, action groups such as the Second National Front
of the Escambray, ALPHA-66, Comandos-L, and Los Pinos Nuevos,
possessed only small quantities of arms. The only substantial
amount of arms in the area was in the hands of KASYZRRER.
4. This information is being disseminated to the Federal
Bureau of Investigation and the Department of State.

4. After writing the letter, the Haitian visited Rolando Masferrer
in New York, brought to him equipment worth $2,000, and told
him to be patient, for the operation against Haiti would be
accomplished.
On 6 May Antonio Rojas Masferrer received a long-distance tele-
phone call from the haitian, who was in Cases According to
Rojas, the Haitian had told him that when Duvalier goes to
Argentina he will not return to Haiti.3 Rojas added that the
United States Government knows this; that some of the Ton Ton
Macoutes (Duvalier's personal police) were already giving up
their jobs and others had been killed in the streets. The
United States Government therefore fears that the Communists
may take over in Haiti.
Rojas said that Rolando Masferrer was worried about the Tapse of time in initiating
the Haitian operation and feared that the plan might mower materialize. However,
injas felt that if the Eaitian plan did not work it, the arms, which would
have supplied about 150 men, could be used in attades minst Cuba.

Field Comments:
1. Source gave the Haitish's name as Vicemart (sic). Henri
Vixamar, who has been identified earlier as the Haitian in
charge of the anti-Duvalier plan, is undoubtedly the person
referred to. Vixamar left Kingston for Tomato by air on

Field Comments
1. Rolando Masferrer has been discussing plans for an
invasion of Haiti for many months. TECSDB-315/00658-66
reported the difficulties he was encountering. See, also,
UPG-6926. CE-212/01421-66.
2. Among earlier claims by Masferrer was one that he had
already purchased the two aircraft. See TUCSDB-315/
00289-66 and -92 rec
U

The Haitian referred to is probably Henri Vixamar, described
earlier as a former Haitian and an official of the Republic
of Chad. Vixamar left Kingston for Toronto on 12 April
by air.
There was a previous report on a telephone
conversation between kolando Masferrer, then in Miami,
and "the Haitian in Canada" regarding "Operation Eaiti."

the equipment that is needed; including two planes and
several boats, to carry out his plans. Rolando Masferrer
added that he had been persecuted by authorities of the Unite
States Government. Es said that after Fidel Castro Ruz has
been overthrown he, Masferrer, will leave for Cuba immediately,
with or without permission from U. S. anthorities. He plans
to follow the example of Francisco Caamano Deno, who, with
small group, stood firm, and became a recognized power in
the Ecminican Republic.
Field Comments.
1. TDCSDB-315/00714-66 gives information on the Masferrer's
plans to invade Haiti.
2. The Haitian may be Henri Vixamar, who has previously been
reported to be involved in the plans to invade Haiti.
He left Kingston, Jamaica, on 12 April "for Toronto,
Canada.
3.
2.
Source Comment. Masferrer's involvement in a plan to
Invade Haiti may be a subterfuge for obtaining a military
force and equipment which will be prepared for action in
the event an internal upheaval occur in Cuba.
Field Comment. Masferrer has a tendency to exaggerate,
and he is disliked and distrusted by many Cuban émigrés.
TDCSDB-315/00658-66 reported on the difficulties he was
encountering in trying to complete his plan for an
invasion of Haiti.

THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION
US national, soldier of fortune type with wide experience in Latin America.
He is closely associated with Rolando Masferrer.
[This report was developed by a lavy representative assigned to the office-
of preparation.]
During the night of 22 Nov 66 a decision was reached to call off the proposed
invasion of Eniti by the group sponsored by Rolando Yesferrer. The invasion
is off indefinitely.
Father Jean Laptiste Georges and Colonel Rene Leon have been arguing with
Vasferrer which has caused confusion and disorganization in the movement.
Vany Cubans scheduled to participate have pulled out and military chief
Napoleon Villaboise (sic), a Cuban national and alleged military expert,
has resigned because of dissension in the group.
It is believed that US Government agencies have infiltrated the movement
and the leaders fear that all weapons and equipment would be confiscated if
plans for the invasion proceeded.
