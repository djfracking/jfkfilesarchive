12. The second incident involved a rather unstable American woman corres-
pondent Subject had met in Brassels. He had become friendly with her there and
had revealed to her his anti-Soviet sympathies. Her association with Subject
in Brussels was well known to some other Americans, including the person who
had introduced Subject to us. Soctime after Subject's return home we learned
that this woman was also to be stationed in Moscow. Knowing that she would
tant to get in touch with Subject, we wrote him that she was coming and advised
him to avoid her. Before he had received our letter she had arrived in Moscow
and bad already visited him. She bold him that her friend, the man who had
introduced us to Subject, had told her under no circuistances to phone or visit
Subject. (The man who had warned her had feared that she would cause Subject
to become suspect to the Soviet security authorities.) This incident upset
equilibrium, as he wrote to us, and although he said that he had taken notice
of our questions to him, he did not reply to our sucou Letter.
