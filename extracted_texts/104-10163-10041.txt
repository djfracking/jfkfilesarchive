MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
BUBJECT:
Telephone Conversation between AMBIDDY-1 and
Martin Ferrer
DATE : 30 June at 1100 hours
1. Upon Erneido Oliva's request, AMBIDDY-1 went to
meet with him last night. At the meeting Oliva mentioned
to A-1 that he (Oliva) was receiving the backing of KUBARK
and the Pentagon and implied A-1 was also receiving aid.
Oliva stated that he has met with Alfredo Rodemeyer, the same
Rodemeyer that both of them had met early last year. A-1
replied this was all before the death of Kennedy and he
no longer had contact with any of ODYOKE's officials.
According to Oliva, Mr. Rodemeyer spoke badly of some of the
personnel in A-l's organization, e.g., Antonio Iglesias.
Oliva mentioned that he had talked with Thomas Mann
•
recently and expected to see Mr. Mann within the coming week
to receive support for his conventional warfare program.
A-1 told Oliva he had no objection to the conventional
warfare plan and that he would morally support Oliva in
liberating Cuba. However, he would continue in his own
little way with his unconventional war. According to A-1,
he made it clear to Oliva that he was not receiving ODYOKE
backing.
A-1 expects to leave on 1 July for Costa Pica
tomorrow. He again mentioned that Adelaide will soon be
leaving the United States. A-1 commented he does not expect
to visit the United Staten as often as he has done in the
past. A-1 asked that Enrique and Mr. Archer clearly under-
stand that he does intend to keep his word concerning the
changes he has mentioned to us at the last two meetings.

AMBIDDY-1 called to say that he had just arrived
in the United States and would only be staying a short.
period and then return to Central America for the next
operation phase. He stated he wanted to discuss some
matters with "Enrique" in Panama within the coming week.
I advised him to let us know exactly when and where and
we would be there.
2.
A-1 inquired if AMJAVA-4. had requested rubber
boats from us at the last meeting A-4 attended in Wash-
ington. A-1 was informed that we had discussed the matter
but could not recall A-4 placing any order with the
Consejo for rafts. A-1 asked if some rafts could be obtained
A-1 did not know the

exact amount needed but would consult with A-4 and call
Martin later in the evening. The rubber rafts could be
sent to same address as were the village radios. A-1
mentioned they had the silent motors.
3. A-1 was asked to inquire what had gone wrong in
Santo Domingo. A-1 believes that the reason the JOANNE
could not be put into drydock was because there was another
ship in the military yard undergoing repairs. A-1 was
advised that was not the information we had received and
could he please check further into the matter. A-1 will
have Rafael GARCIA confront President Reid and obtain the
true story.

SUBJECT: DMJK Engineers
Sambora reported he met with AMBIDDY/1 at the Miami
airport on 5 June 1964 for a brief discussion of organi-
Eational changes. After their talk, A/1 requested Sambora
accompany him to the airport hotel to act as interpreter
with an American engineer (possibly DMJM). Sambora did -
not recall the name of the engineer but that the engineer
had stated the airstrip in Nicaragua would cost somewhere
in the vicinity of a million dollars. According to
Sambora, A/1 simply listened to the proposal and said he
would take the matter under advisement.

GUERTLER again reminded A-19 that it was no longer sufficient
to merely deny ODYOKE involvement in the project but was necessary
to take positive steps to implicate other Latin American governments
and create the impression of increasing difficulties with ODYOKE.
It was lift to A-19's discretion on how to do this, but when talking
about his problems with AMWORLD-2, Sopo and Male it was suggested
that he do this in strictest confidence as just for the inner
circle of AMYUM. This will guarantee the story proper dissemination.

critical period following the Miami press conference,
AKYUM-19 was the only available, cleared channel to
AMWORLD and time, in view of GDACID's unfavorable reaction,
was of the essence. AMJAVA/4 was asked to convey this
explanation to AMBIDDY-1 and to stress that we consider
ANYUM-19 his senior rep in FBPRIME.
8. AMJAVA/4 stated that there had been many betrayals
and consequently AMBIDDYẹl was always careful. At times
he might even think that AMYUM-19 was not loyal which,
AMJAVA/4 added, "Of course is not true." As AMBBIDDY-1
analyzes his own performance, he is satisfied that he is
performing well. has been in the resistance business
since Batista's days and many intimate friends have be-
trayed him. At the present moment, he does not have 100%
confidence in anyone. Everything he is told, he analyzes.
As an example, AMJAVA/4 briefs Chaves (the Mexican) on
projected operation. AMBIDDY-1 will question AMJAVA/4
closely in order to make sure that the instructions did
not deviate from the plan as conceived by him.
9. Among matters which should be taken up with
AMBIDDY-1 direct, no matter how ticklish, was e.g. the
case of .HOLE. AMJAVA/4 and AMYUM-19: know that KUBARK
have a poor opinion of him. Then why beat around the
bush? AMJAVA/4 at least had not witnessed any mention

of this by BECKHOFF in AMBIDDY-1's presence.
AMYUM-19 had reported GUENŢELER's statement that he
sidered MOLE a poor choice for the intelligence job to
AMBIDDY-1 and the latter had jumped to the conclusion that
it was AMYUM-19 putting words into GUERÉELER's mouth.
10. BECKHOFF comented as follows: AMYUR-19 will have
to tell GUEREFLER or myself if in a give instance a personal
demarche is indicated. There are certain things which,
with AMBIDDY-1 out of the country, simply cannot be put
the shelf. We have no choice but to tell GUERNELER
tell AMYUM-19 who, however, should feel

I then casually mentioned to him that we had

3. I noticed the remark concerning the photographs

AMRIDSY-1 inquired. I nodded and to avoid his anxing
further questions about the pictures, I reminded him of
his promise that Lucia Cano. Natacha d'Angelo (AMBIDOY-1

LSHINGTON, D.C. 19 May 1964
SUBJECT: AMBIDDY'S PERSONEEL POLICY
1. ANJAVA/4 offered the following analysis of
AMBIDDY-1's personal policy as a significent facet
of his relationship with others.
2. AMBIDDY-1 is a leader and a very proud leader
not like to fail in the presence of his associates.
3. AMJAVA/4 was glad that the Miami incident (13 May
press conference) happened. "AMBIDDY-1 was really angry
with himself."
From the start AMJAVA/4 has tried to convince
AMBIDDY-1 that Jose MOLE ROSALES is not qualified for
intelligence so far in vain. "To let MOLE fail in
doing the job is the way to convince AMBIIDY-1”
5. ANTUM-19 cannot handle MOLE or Edgar SOPO,
because AMRIDDY-1 won't let him. "We shall have to wait

AMWOULD MEETING IN WASHINGTON, D.C. 19 May 1964
SUBJECT: AMBIDDY's Reaction to Advice to
Delay Return to U.S.
1. ANJAVA/4 reported that ANYUN-19 conveyed to
AHBIMY-1 my advice that be not return to FAFRIŒ right
may, but permit the dust to settle. According to
IMJAVA/4 Chis advice led AMBIDDY-1 to conclude that
ODACID did not want him back in PEPRIME. In order to
test this theory, AMBIDDY-1 decided to make a beeline
for the U.S. Embassy in Managua to pick up his immi❤
gration visa.
2. (Headquarters has learned that the visa was
romptly granted and we presume AMBIDDY-1's concern
hat he had been exiled a second time has as a resulc
assuaged.). I asked AMJAVA/4 to tall AMBIDDY-1
at we would be honored to welcome him as a potential
illow-citizen. Also, our relationship was based upon
complete mutual trust. Our job was to protect his
that
sar in FBPRIME. What we vare concerned about was that
AMBIDDY-1, should he return at this time, would un-
loubtedly be talked to by ODACID, ODENVY and the press.
All this it would be best to sidestep.
3. AMJAVA/4 was asked to convey to AMBIDDY-1
that we will tell him when the coast is clear. If this
notwithstanding he should return to PBPRIME, the decision
would, of course, be his.d”It is his right come back
at any time, but I think my advice is good.”

11. BECKHOFF stressed that we were anxious not to
give AMBIDDY-1 the impression that there exists any
special relationship between us and AMYUM-19, AMJAVA/4.
Our relationship was with AMBIDDY-1 who is the leader
of the movement.
vement. AMJAVA/4. replied that he had told AMBIDDY-1
this and that BECKHOFF had made this point very clear at
their first meeting in Puerto Rico (see AMWORLD Meeting
meno, 3–6 September 1963. Subject: Briefing of AMJAVA/4.)
BECKHOFF added that he had told AMYUM-19 and wished to
repeat this in the presence of AMJAVA/4 that anything
discussed while AMBIDDY-1 was not present, could be told
hia. Nothing was "off-the-record" in the sense of to
be withheld from AMBIDDY-1.
12. According to AMJAVA/4, AMBIDDY-1 knows full
well that KUBARK considers him the Chief. If we decided
to conspire against AMBIDDY-1 in league with AMJAVA/4
and AMYUM-19, this could only be done within AMYUN, the
political movement, since AMJAVA/4 and AMYUM-19_form pars
of that organization. Our support, however, is to
AMBIDDY-1 and not AMYUM. AMBIDDY-1 knows that.

At 10:30 p.m., said an M.R.R.
spokesman in Miami, Artime and a
"strong force of commandos" had gone
ashore at Puerto Pilón, 145 miles from

Linking up with a second force of
guerrillas from the nearby Sierra Mnes-
tra mountains, the exiles had captured
the town and held it for three hours
against Castro's militia, during that time
declaring it a "free territory of Cuba."

No one believes that a second frontal

What does seem to be in the works is
an attempt at infiltration, sabotage and

then inquired it he could see the photographs. I replied
that it was our feeling that it would serve no useful
purpose other than to satisfy his own curiosity. Inasmuch
as he had promised to take Adelaida out of the country,
there was no sense in rubbing salt into the wound. Further
more, we did not wish to reveal our sources to AMBIDOY-1.
Lastly, both he and I know that photographs could be
fabricated and we did not want to be falsely accused of
doing just this. AMBIDDY-1 again asked that I infors
BECKHOFF that he is interested in seeing the pictures.
In order to drop the entire subject, I promised AMBIDDY-1
I would pass the message to BECKHOFF.
**
BECKHOFF believes that this (notional) intervention
jarred AMBIDDY-1 out of his complacent assumption that we
lack substantial information to back up our claim that
Adelaida's immoralities are more than unprovable rumors.
Also, hopefully, he may now have been put on guard and
may take adequate precautions against blackmail of himself
or Adelaida which we consider a major threat to the security
of AMWORLD. If in future meetings AMBIDDY-1 should revert
to the existence of these photographs, it may be best to
state that they were promptly destroyed but that their also
being in the possession of potential blackmailers can never
be ruled out. AMBIDDY-1 should be reminded of his assurance
to alert us immediately if such blackmail attempts are
since he may need our help in warding them off.

such difficulties to remind him of his failure to need

of being very satisfied with his trip and COD-

theme that MAY's effort is the last hope to
free Cuba. I told Szule that I certainly felt
that BAY's contribution is tremendously important.
In this connection I observed that DAY's drawing
power was obviously increasing for I had only
recently received a query from rather conserva-

them to speak with RAY's representatives,
specifically Rogelio CISNEROS.I tole Szule
that in keeping with our policy, I had said.
that MAY and his group appeared to represent

liberation of their country and in the restors-

person calling me that it might be wise to speak
to KAY's group nos vaen the opportunity presents
itself rather than to face the possibility of
having to stand in line later. Szule indicated
that he knew of which group I was speaking and.

Smule then told me that he had heard vis

to anyone that BECKHOFF had talked with him about this affair
(See AMWORLD Meeting Meso 15-16. Feb 1964, Subject: Adelaida
Padron y Cruz.)
2. BECKHOFF re-affirmed that the matter had been raised
in compliance with his wishes that we let him know about any
derogatory information on subject. He had been told "in slow
English" that we in fact had information from several sources
which testify to Subject's former intimate relations with
Fulgencio Batista. BECKHOFF had drawn ANBIDDY-1's attention
to the following alternatives:

AMBIDWY-1 had listened carefully, merely commenting
at all this was "very interesting." He had not been pressed
ake a decision. Specifically, BECKHOFF had told him that
ject was reputed to have been the mistress of other prom
mixent Cubans, besides Batista, and that AMBIDDY-1 could
conceivably be blackmailed by JURE and the press, to mention
only a few sources of threat presumed knowledgeable.
ANBIDDT-1 had not been told that his affair with
Pubject was liable to jeopardize AMWORLD. After all, he
was an intelligent man who did not have to be told the
obvious, viz. that a press-scandal would be serious indeed.
DAINOLD, wiem SECRET had consulted, had taken the position
that AKBIDUY-1 should roach the necessary conclusions himself.
Our position we that ANBIDDY-1 could not run a political
novament unless he could handle his personal affairs,
blackmail potential in this affair was serious as far as
KUBARK is conserned.

image for Aktinė. in talking eita Szulc. the subject of
ARTINE arose from time to time. Brule mentioned that it
had come to ais attention test APTINK was in New York
"with some babe or another and nowhere near the scene
of the strike. Szule was also extremely critical of the
press releases made by ARTIM2. I took this occasion to
say that I had discussed the matter of ARTINE with people
who are much more familiar with his activities than I,
given that they are in another geographical area, and that.
it was my impression that AKTINE is not being given as
such credit for his efforts as pernape no anould be and
that it may well be that he has fairly solid plans which
cannot be actually initiated until such a time as he has
welded together the nucleus of a new organization under
fire. Once experienced in their present activity, it
could well be taat AKTINA could follow the RAY concept
of developing resistance within. I told Szulc that I
believed that the activities of ANTIME and Kloy GUTIERREZ
Memoyo could not but help RAY's program. Szale's basic
reaction to favorable statements regarding ABŢINE may
may be
best described as a snort.

a home we advised him that many derogatory reports have
reached our ears concerning his purchase of a home and
for this reason only we wanted to get the record straight
and thereby be in a better position to combat malicious
rumors. A-1 said he understood and it was evident A-1
did not take it (the inquiry) as a personal affront.
During a break in the meeting A-1 went home to obtain the
necessary data on the house. Within a few hours A-1
returned with the information plus a blueprint of
house.
A-1 stated the only house he owns in the one
in which he and Adelaida are now residàng. This house
located at 1370 N. H. 85 Street, Miami, Florida.

8 May 1964 at 1030 hours
1. The undersigned reminded Mike GEIDEL that it is
essential that AMBIDDY-1 meet with "RODEMEYER" when the
former returns to Miami.
2. Nike stated that YERGO (MRR Dominican Republic
delegate) had received a telephone call from President Reid
or some other high official in the Dominican Republic which
stated that President Reid would like to meet with AMBIDDY–1

3. Martin next brought up the subject of the MID.
It was GRIDEL's impression that this organization might be
nothing more than a provacation. This opinion is also shared
by JMWAVE. Mike commented that AMYUM-19 has met with members
of this organization who for the most part are unwilling to
return to Cuba. A-19 would like to test their mettle before
negotiating with them any further. A-19 intends to give this
organization some sabotage materials and see what happens,

7. According to Maagdenberg, the Dutch engineer, the
ship is in fairly good condition and should require no more
than five days in drydock. A-1 casually mentioned that
the Dutchman had to be dissuaded from going on the operation
itself.
.8. A-1 was reminded we must have a firm statement from
him as to when the operation is to take place if we are to
be of assistance to his organization during the critical
period. A-1 stated he had promised to break the heads of
the commo people aboard the ship if they fail to advise him
as to when the Swift departs from the mothership.
9. A-1 would probably leave for Nicaragua on Wednesday
to be at the base in time for the operation.

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES
1. According to AHYUN-19 (DOI 4 May), AMBIDDY-1 once more is
giving serious thought to contracting marriage with Subject.
2. According to AMYUM-19, AMBIDDY-1 suffers pangs of conscience
and has premonitions of hell. What he has in mind is a church
wedding with all the trimmings. Since Subject's previous marriage
was not solemnized by the Church, AMBIDDY-l's conscience appears
unbothered.
3. ANYUM-19 claims that AMBIDDY-1 brushes off allegations about
Subject's 'alleged affair with Fulgencio Batista as mere calumny.
He does not know whether AMBIDDY-1 has ever asked Subject to confirm
or deny the rumor.
4. The root of the trouble, as ANYUN-19 sees it, is that AMBIDOY-1
in the person of Subject is encountering a seasoned pro who plays with
consummate skill upon his vanity and who exploits his naivete which
is that of "a 14 year old." AMBIDDY-1, in fashioning personal relation-
ships, is unable to make adjustments to the circumstance that, being
a person of some importance, his personal affections are not always
cultivated on purely unselfish grounds.
"
5. ANYUM-19 claims that Subject's former husband, Roger Hermilio'
Rojas Lavernis, is attempting to blackmail AMBIDDY-1 and that some of
AMBIDDY–1's seemingly closest associates may be harboring similar
designs.
BECKHOFF restated the position of KUBARK as one of non-inter-
vention as long as matrimony is kept in abeyance. Conversely, marriage
and any ensuing scandal would force us to re-assess our position and,
in extremes, might force KUBARK to withdraw its backing of AMWORLD.
7. AEYUN-19 expressed the view that AMBIDDY-1 would probably
forego marriage if made aware of KUBARK's position as stated above.
We rejoined that AMBIDDY-1, should he solicit our views (but not
otherwise), would be told just that.
GUERTLER is hereby authorized to state KUBARK's position along
Huss indicated in Para í if the occasion presents itself.

1.
'
AMBIDDY-1 was reminded that he should make a quick
trip to the Dominican Republic to see President Reid and to
arrange for drydocking and refueling facilities. A-1 was
advised to use a more subtle approach than used on Colonel
Lopez of Honduras. A-l's main objective should be to get.
"his foot in the door" in the Dominican Republic. A-1
should pursue the soft sell rather than the hard sell.
Since he sounded a bit reluctant to forego the next operational
phase in order to repair the ADELAIDA, A-1 was reassured.
that the overhauling of the ADELAIDA would take place after
the operation rather than before. A-1 will take AMJ/FA-4
with him to the Dominican Republic. Should President Reid
ask for the name of the shipping company who will act as
the agent for Maritima Eam, A-1 should say it is the Boyd
Brothers Shipping Company.
2. A-1 was asked if he had obtained his U. S. visa.
A-1 replied he has all the documents ready and will request
it next time he goes to Nicaragua.
3. A-1 has no objection to AMYUM-19's attending the
next meeting in Puerto Rico. The undersigned informed A-1
that we are preparing the intelligence data on the targets
he requested, and they will be presented to him at our
_ meeting.

A-1 was informed that although Kelly enjoys a great deal
of influence with Esso we doubt that he has that much
influence. As it stands now the LCM obtains supplies there
and it is then tranferred to the ADELAIDA because A-1 is
reluctant to take the ADELAIDA near the Esso installation.

ANWORLD Meeting in San Juan, P. R., 2-5 May 1964.
SUBJECT: Reality of autonomy
:
'
1. On 4 May 1964 HQS representatives raised with ANYUN-18
the question if AMBIDDY-1 in his own mind accepts the premise
of independence from KUBARK control in his management of AMWORLD
affairs. AMYUM-19 replied that AMBIDDY-1 had not always done.
so, but had now become convinced that he was in de facto control
of ANWORLD. Commenting upon that fact, AMBIDDY-1 had recently
remarked that he now thought he could, if he so decided, fire
1c7both AMJAVA-4 and ANYUM 19 without KUBARK attempting
gainsay him.
'
8. The arrival of Janes ZABOTH on the seene had at first
-kindled AMBIDDY-1's suspicions that KUBARK may after all try
However, ZABOTH's.
to clamp tight controls upon his operations.
general approach had disarmed those suspicions and convinced –
MBIDDY-1 that he is in fact master of his destiny. AMYUM-19
reminisced that ANBIDDY-1 had in the beginning suspected him
and ANJAVA-4 as being KUBARK plants. AMYUM-19 added he wanted
to be quite candid in telling us that he would not himself have
accepted a position in AMWORLD had he entertained the slightest
doubts as to the sincerity of KUBARK's promise of autonomy.
Ve re-emphasized our adherence to the principles of
autonomy, witness our desire to disengage from extensive involve-
ment in AMWORLD logistics, our non-interference in personnel.
matters (except where overriding ODYOKE security interests
involved) and our future handling of bubsidy payments.
.
4. Comment: We found no reason for disbelieving AMYUM–19's
acceptance of autonomy as the principle guiding our sole in
ANWORLD. As an aside, AMYUM-19 observed that AMBIDDY-1 should
not be expected to subordinate himself to PRPRIZE controls of
any kind once FORUMIN had been liberated and we allowed that
this
is was likely to be the case..

a
ANTUM-19 confided us that ANBIDDY-1 had, prior
launching of Operation ZENON, prepared a "three and
half page" news release which laid exaggerated claim to
damages inflicted during the raid on Santa Cruz del Sur.
Only the last sentence stated, more or less as an afterthought,
that this should be considered just a minor MRR operation.
ANTUM 19 has told ABIDDY-1 that in his opinion any future
announcements should be held down to one or two brief para-
graphs.
3. We pointed out to ANYUK-19 that AMBIDDY-1 vas
vidently paying no more than lip service to our recommen-
dation that he under-rather than over--play his successes.
During the Washington meeting (19-21 March 1964) we had
criticized a statement made by ANBIDDY-1 during a Miami press
conference to wit: "We do not have enough boats. In one
night we can make two trips but not more, but we are doing
it. We will fill the country with enough arms to free the
country from comm
mmuni:
We took the position that if we were
IN AMBIDDY-1's shoes we simply wouldn't let on about military
matters since this plays into Castro's hands, giving him
gratuitous access to military intelligence. AMBIDDY-1
countered by asking us how he could raise the morale of the
people without saying anything and without talking about
successful ops inside.
What
Ve mentioned to AMBIDDY-1 that any vital informa
tion not publicized makes the tank of Castro's espionage
service that more difficult. Besides, things had now com
to a pass where little credence was placed in claims of
success and promises held out by Cuban exile leaders. Whe
really counted was the demonstrable substance of success
faside which speaks for itself. ANBIDDT-1Would be much

SUBJECT: The Nature of

1. Alluding to certain charges levelled against CIA in
& recent publication on the Bay of Pigs affair, whose sub-
stance was that the Cuban military leadership had been served
with erroneous intel estimates by their CIA advisors, I voised
to ANTUM-19 the hope that the U. 8. team servicing ANWORLD
would never be subjected to similar consure (without implying
matification for charges made in the instance of the Bay of
Pigs). I reiterated that it was our strong desire to be
absolutely forthright with our Cuban counterparts, especially
rtressing that our target intelligence had by its very nature
0 of limited usefulness, especially when it came to predicting
extent and nature of Cuban defense measures. As an example,
certain radar sites had struck us as highly vulnerable to ex-
ernal raids, but that this estimate might not necessarily be
out if put to the test of an actual operation.

CONTACT REPORT # 54
OPERATION: AMWORLD
DATE TYPED: 6 Apr.
CONTACT: AHYUM-18
TIME AND PLACE: 0930-1100 Hrs. Apr. 64, 8/H 269
NEXT MEETING: Unscheduled
SUMMARY
1. A-19 was asked to provide the Case Officer with a sample
of recent AMYUM radio programs. (Comment: P/W requested this.
A Station contact is considering producing a "Monitor"-type
program, originating in Miami, and broadcast over WRUL. All
exile groups would be represented and it would provide a means
for special broadcasts such as announcements of any successful
AMWORLD ops, etc.
2. Reports from Nacin Elias frequently mention an action
known as "M.L.B", one of whose leaders uses the war name
Diablo". A report from Nacin dated 16 March included an appeal
for help in exfiltrating "el: Diablo" and some others who are in
danger. A-19 has heard that six men of the M.IND. have just
come out. One of the men is said to be "el Diablo"(. Comment:
Confirmed by BARR 1853) After they have been processed and
debriefed A-19 will have them debriefed by AMFAST-64 and
Alonso. A-19 believes that this group is the source of most
of the documents furnished by Nacin and are either the only
worthwhile contacts of Macin or are completely controlled by
GOC. The latter theory is probably the correct one.
A-15 thinks that the captain of the Adelaida w}} eventuall7
be replaced by Hunne if he does not quit first. He is still not
expercising the kind of leadership necessary for military p3.
This, of course, will necessitate finding a new captain for the

undereigned replied that quite a bit of information pertaining
to AMWORLD was coming across his desk and that it appeared to

Guantanamo, Oriente Province 7 June 1916 may be identical
with the subject of an AMOT report listing him as candidate
for councilman of Guantanamo City Hall on the PSP slate during
the Grau regime and stating that his son is private secretary
to Carlos Olivares, Undersecretary of Foreign Relations Ministry
of the GOC. A-19 was so informed and was asked to have and
investigation made, taking into consideration both the CI and
operational leads aspects of the matter.
6. Aida PEREZ Pozo. Guertler asked what her function was with
AMWORLD. A-19 admitted that he was surprised to see her name on
the payroll. She is working with Mole in intelligence. She
has all the lesbian contacts in the city and knows everything
that goes on. Nothing can be done about it because she is another
"woman of confidence" of AMBIDDY–1.
7. The Case Officer brought up the matter of telephone security,
the possibility that A-19's private line and his hope phone
could be tapped, and suggested the use of pay phones for operational
calls, especially to the Consejo. In order to make use of direct
dialing A-19 could call the Consejo giving his number and await
the return call. (The Consejo might want to bring this up with
A-1) According to A-19 Mole's group is monitoring all calls to
ANYUM headquarters but he does not think his private line (the
one used by GUERTLER) is monitored. In reply to the Case Officer's
question A-19 said that A-1 does his business calls from his home,
.e. the house of his mistress. The Case Officer commented that
this fact was known to another group (unspecified) and let the
natter drop.
The reason for the blown AMYUM safe houses while the AMYUNS
ere on the roof stringing the antenna one of them drove his
car onto the lawn of the neighbor so that it would be in the
shade of the neighbors tree. Naturally the neighbor came out
to see what was going on. He did see. As A-19 waid, when he
learned of the incident he had to laugh (albeit somewhat hysterically)
The only alternative would be to kill the idiot. Guertler agreed.
We can only hope that the next safe house will be very isolated.

and remarked that it could be for any number of reasons completely
unrelated to his past relations with KUBARK.
■. 16 PRQ Is were turned over for traces. The various group leaders
are continuing to recruit for their groups. The Case Officer suggested
that they might employ their time more profitably by working with
what they already have and leave the recruiting to AMYUM-23. A-19
agreed that the system had to be changed in fact. It was changed
in theory some time ago. Chertler suggested that it would be a lot
easier on all concerned to look for people with the qualifications
to fill existing slots instead of the present procedure of looking
for jobs to give all the volunteers that present themselves.&fter
having screened at least a thousand volunteers we still keep getting
PRQs on potential cooks or people for whom no specific job exists
but who are considered "very good boys", A-19 agreed. Probably
nothing will change.

CONTACT REPORT # 55
OPERATION: AMNORLE
DATE TYPED: 7 Apr 6%
CONTACT: AMYUM-19
TIME AND PLACE : 1800–1630 Hre., 6 Apr 64, S/H
SUMMARY
1. Attached are two recent reports covering the activities
of Jose Elias aka Nacin. The Habana contact, Bernardo Nievares
has informed AMYUM that if he can be picked up he will be able
to come to the WAVE area for about 15 days for debriefing and
training. The Ramon Mondejar Cid, aka "el diablo" mentioned as
having been released by the G-2 and waiting for exfiltration
currently in the WAVE area, having escaped with four others.
According to A-19 they have been interviewed by DDURGE and were
told to have no contact with any other PBRUMEN groups because
they could receive special training and be sent back to work
against AMTHUG. The AMYUM: have been debriefing the five for
several days with the sam idea in mind. GUERTLER will get the
reports when the debriefings are over. A-19 has not gotten the
preliminary reports but says Alonso is impressed with Mondejar.
As for the exfiltration of Nievares AMYUM has no intention of
attempting it but A-19 is considering offering the opportunity
do so to Aldo Vera (see below).
Aldo VERA Serafin (201-326634) This subject is a former member
of the DTI, recently considered for use in an attempt to defect
a COC official in Madrid. The AMYUMS consider nim a good action
type and sought him out with the intention of infiltrating him.
and his group into Habana province. He is presently receiving
special training for the job. Vera's file generally substantiates
A-19's evaluation of the man. However, local traces do contain
unsubstantiated accusations that he is a G-2 and that he maintains
contacts with alleged G-2 agents and informers. An ODEEVY report
In 1963 said that Vera was engaged in transmitting and receiving
messages by radio with Cuba. The Case Officer informed A-19- that
while he had nothing definite to offer by way of proof he had
some doubts about Vare and cited the above. A-19 says that Vera.

he offered high radio facilities to AMYUM. Assuming that Vera himself

out and to obtain a cemplate report on Vera's plans before making
any commitments. The undersigned continues to have some reservations
but Verawas requested by AMSHAG-1, and A-19 likes him so far.
Guertler will pursue the matter further at a later resting.

permission for him to leave the country he will be blackballad.

other pieces of major size.
At the Hotel National of Havana, they changed the "4 barrel" anti-

OPERATION : AMWORLD
CONTACT REPORT #56
DATE TYPED:10 Apr. 64
CONTACT: AMBIDDY-1,AMJAVA-4,AMYUM-19
TIME AND PLACE: 1030-2400 Hrs., 9 Apr. S/H
SUMMARY
1. The Case Officer confirmed that A-1 had definitely decided
not to attempt Operation Genesis and will mount Operation Zenon
instead. The undersigned agreed that this was a wise decision
since the latest reports indicated increasing hostile naval
activity in the area, making chances for survival extremely
slight, and reminded A-1 of his recent speech in which he stated
that AMWORLD propaganda was in support of military operations and
not the reverse, hinting that AMBANG would sacrifice his men
for the sake of publicity for himself. A military operation, even
if it failed completely would not be as harmful as an obvious?”
publicity stunt that cost lives and equipment. A-l appeared to
accept the necessity for postponing Genesis but was obviously
disappointed at not being able to land his sharpshooter to take
shot at the guest of honor during the military review.
"
2. A-1 and A-4 were given the sequence of Q signs to be transmitted
during the test run of the signal plan to be used during the op,
The Case Officer reminded A-1 to tell his people that the transmissions
will come from one of his bases, and to make certain that the captain
of the Adelaida has his copy of the key. The writer suggested that
A-1 merely inform that ship te monitor the frequency and to report
to A-1 what signals were received and what action would have been
taken.
Quertler asked that the Consejo be informed of the Q signs
to be used by the Adelaida and the intermediate craft and the bass.
Ant said that it would be sent up by radio.
6. The writer suggested that the hourly position reports be start
right way to be certain that all would function smoothly during
the operation. Since around-the-clock monitoring of the ships
transmissions will interfere with Disneyland communications with
other bases a second radio will be required. One of the agent
radios will be taken to the base.
A-19 has not located a site for the WAVE transmitter. Alonso
has several prospects and A=ls will inspect them and inform the
Gase Officer soonest. In the meantime, Guertler suggested using
the AHYUM office since amidst all the confusion it would probably
not attract attention. A-4 was also reminded to furnish us with
the signal plan for the WAV Nicaragua link. (The plans to
communicate with Managua war abandoned. Commo will be with Disneyland
The complete operational plan for Zenon was turned over to the
Case Officer on 10 Apr. The essentiale were cabled to headquarters,

TIME AND PLACE: 1500-1630, 13 Apr. 64, S/H
SUMMARY

A pri
22 PRQ Is turned over for traces.
2. As per UFGW-3513 A-19 was reminded that in the future it
was absolutely necessary that the AMWORLD monthly accounting
received on time, othem ise our payments may be delayed.
3. Payroll changes: Guertler discussed the payroll changes
noted in UFGW-3490. The two crewmen mentioned were terminated
for being AWOL but were carried for two months before being
told that they would not be given another chance. "ne two
examples cited for pay increases are explained by the fact that
while the two man were still in the WAVE area they received no
family allotment. They are not at the camps and so are being
paid more. A-19 was reminded that the insurance, forms must be.
submitted in order for an AMWORLDER to be covered and that if
a person is terminated all coverage ceases and will not be resumed
automatically if the person is re-hired. A-19 says he understands
this perfectly and will keep us up to date on all hirings and
firings.
A-19 was reminded that some of the PRQ Is submitted for traces
unnecessarily vague, citing the case of one submitted from
Puerto Rico on Oscar RODRIGUEZ Fernandes. The subjects record
of employment lists "Secret Police" without indicating when or
for what government.
The Case Officer told A-19 that the Consejo had learded that.
Captain Reinaldo BLANCO and Gustavo de los REYES may wish to
contact AMBIDDY-1 and that they might prove useful and should be
given a hearing. A-19 replied that BLANCO had been trying to see
ala for two weeks but that he had been stalling because he did
not know what he could do with him at this stage of the project.
The Case Officer recommended that he should be given a chance
since, he might prove useful in the future. A-19 said that he would
get in touch with him.

6. Quertler asked A-19 if he knew the circumstances surrounding
the case of Blas COMAS Castro, captain of a JURE beat reported
to be in trouble after having received a letter from AMBIDDY-1
thanking him for signing up for AMWORLD. A-19 said that he would
check, but as far as he knew the man must have filled out a form,
and that it was not a frameup.
7. Ramon MONDEJAR Cid and the other members of the M.I.D. recently
arrived from Habana have been completely debriefed by the AMYUM
intelligence section. Very little was revealed by them during
their processing at the Refugee Center, but they have been
very cooperative with the AMYUMS. They have been kept isolated
from the rest of the PBRUMEN community with the intention of
training them and sending them back. A-19 would like to use
Aldo VERA Serafin's group to reinfiltrate this group and pick up
the Habana coordinator, Barnardo NIRVARES. Now that Nacin is not
available, having been kicked out of YOACRE (at KUBARK request,
according to A-19) the AMYUMS have no way to contact NIEVARES.
A-19 mentioned using his embassy contacts to do this, but the
writer strongly urged him to keep this group completely compartmented
from any other groups. So far MONDEJAR has made a very favorable.
impression on his interviers but very little is known about the
coordinator, Benny NIEVARE:. Guertler suggested that A-19 should
have these people questioned about wh : they know of NIEVARES,
the circumstances surrounding their recruitment. This group was
sent with the specific mission of contacting AMBIDDY 1 and asking
for material help. From what is known of this organization it
seems quite likely to be a provocation, and ar A-19 admits, these
people are either unusually competent or completely controlled.
A-19 wants to put them to the test by providing them with sab
material and asking them to hit a specific target before discussing
the matter of further financial or, material aid.

ever, A-1 again reminded this office of the impact an attack
on Playa Giron on the 17th of April would have on the morale
of the Cuban people. The undersigned replied that there are
two sides to the coin; should their operation fail, this would
play into the hands of Castro, and it was the opinion of this
office that the alternate plan would also do much to raise the
morale of the Cuban people.
2. In conclusion it was reaffirmed to A-1 that the
inal decision is his. He replied that after his meeting
with AMJAVA-4 and AMYUM 19 he will let us know the final
decision.

7. Guertler suggested Curaçao as a suitable place for drydocking
Adelaida for needed repairs after the operation. A-1 demurred,
stating that it would be needed for an infiltration op on 3 May.
A-19 was told that it was of the utmost importance that the AKL
Dolores be provided with a top quality captain and engineer,
regardless of cost or nationality, that the equipment was very
sensitive and was irreplacable. A-19 stated that it would be a
problem, especially the engineer, but that he would do so. Guertler'
offered no suggestions where to look, marely commenting that not
that AMWORLD had made many commercial contacts he should be able
to obtain assistance in locating, a good man for the job.'
8. The complete crew for the Dolores has not been signed yet. Some
of the crew from the Adelaida can fill in while she is in drydock.
9. A-lowas told that the Consejo was negoriating for Standard 011
of New Jersey to provide AMWORLD will its fuel on a regular basis
and that the company war.ted a letter from some prominent Nicaraguan
official stating that this was acceptable to the GON.
10. The Case Officer asked A-19 if AMWORLD-2 had closed his Swiss
account for certain. A-19 replied yes. The writer then told him that
that was good because the $25,000 used to open the accound would
be refunded to A-2 and that instead of returning it to the Consejo
they could keep it and we would deduct the amount from the next
month's budget (they have spent most of it already). Shocked looks
around the table. They have already spent most of it. It was a
included in the unexpended assets reported three months ago and
deducted fucceeding month's deposit Henry said we could spend
it. The writer professed surprise since this money was not allocated
to the project but was only to be used to keep the account open.
This lead to a series of complaints about PBPRIME business methods,
*the fact that Ramsay Scarlet has recently billed them for $30,000
for something incurred in November, and was that any way to run
business. The writer commented that they just didn't understand
anglo-saxon psychology and called it an evening, wishing them
the best of luck on their operation.

A Cuban exile observer who was present during the speech.
Headquarters Comment. The following is a résumé of the political
philosophy of Manuel Artime Buesa, leader of the Movimiento de
Recuperacion Revolucionaria (MRR, Movement for Revolutionary
Recovery) as prepared by Source. It is based on statements
made by Artime in his speech on 18 March 1964 to the Associación
para Recuperación Económica de Cuba (AREC, Association for
Economic Recovery of Cuba), on his first publication entitled
Comunismo por qué? (Communism for what?), which was written
nine months before Castro came to power, and on Artime's book
Traición (Betrayal).
Artime does not believe in political extremes - neither the
left nor the right. He believes that extremes always end by
touching one another. If any extreme gains power in Cuba,
and in the case of the extreme right by imposing a dictatorship,
he will continue to fight with weapons in hand. Artime does
not believe in the classification of men by race, by political
ranks in former governments, or by money. He confesses to being
an opportunist in the sense that he is taking maximum advantage
of each opportunity, but not in the sense of changing his
beliefs in accord with opportunities.
It
The main theme of Comunismo por qué? was that more than a change
in government a change in the conscience of men is needed.
outlined the duties of the padrón (landowner) toward the workers
so that the latter may live in dignity and honor. The padron
should feel that the problems of his workers are also his problems.
The worker, in turn, has certain obligations to the padron. If
this quid pro quo is not adhered to, a (Christian) government
has the right to intervene for the common good. In his letter
of resignation to Fidel Castro accusing the latter of being a

Communist and traitor, Artime mentioned that he resigned
because Castro had not been honest with the businessmen by
not telling them their property would be confiscated.
The following excerpts from Artime's book Traicion clearly
outline Artime's ideology:
"We believe the state should foment and stimulate private
We have to have an
economy, both national and foreign.
effective democracy in Latin America because the word.
democracy in that area has been prostituted too often.
Many countries call themselves democratic but in reality
are nothing but militarist and demagogic, and many simply
go through the motions of elections. Many are simply
totalitarian governments which are living off the blood
and toil of the people. The corrupt politicians, the
strong men, the totalitarians have been the strongest
allies of Communism. Our fight is not against one man,
it is not a war of personal hatred--it is a war against
the doctrine of hatred, be it called Castro or what have
you--it is a war against a doctrine; we are as much opposed
to Khrushchev as we are against Tito. We are as much opposed
to the totalitarian' left as we are opposed to the fascist right"
"We don't care if they call us extremist.
They will con-
tinue to call us rightist or leftist, fascist, philocom-
munist. I recall the words of Don Quixote when he was
passing on the outskirts of a small town and Sancho said
to Don Quixote, 'Sir, the dogs are barking at us,' Don
Quixote replied, Let them, Sancho, if they are barking
it is because we are moving. And we will continue to move.
c. "They say we are very ambitious.
-
Our ambition is that in
the coming days when Cuba is liberated people will pro-
nounce our name with respect in our country."
"Our men in Cuba are not only fighting for the independence
of our country but also for the independence of the American
hemisphere, for the survival of Christian principles in
America, for the Western world." Artime maintains that
the situation today is much the way Lenin would have hoped
for. Britain and France have recognized Red China; the
U.S. is at odds with these two governments--this is exactly
what Lenin would have wanted. Artime has supported his
statements, by quoting Lenin, "Within 30 years we will em-
bark on a peace offensive, of coexistence, and we will
split the free nations and smash the impotent bourgeois."
:
:
"The battle-ground for Latin America lies 30 miles from
Four shores, Should the Western world lose this battle,
the sleeping giant (Latin America) will wake up on the
side of the Communist camp. Then it would be preferable
to be dead because the free world will have ceased to be."
.
"We are all guilty for having turned over Cube, to the hands
of men who could not govern her properly. We have knocked
on doors and will continue to do so because our cause is
honorable. We cannot afford to wait for miracles.We
must prepare for a long fight and not expect the aid of
such organizations as the OAS and the UN.It is up to the
Cubans to liberate Cuba. If we are not going to wage
war of principles, I will not join that struggle,”

A-1 would like to have several of the village radios
sent to him in Miami in order to hand carry them to Nicaragua.
A-1 was informed we would have to check into the matter.
8.
Upon arriving in Miami, A-1 accidentally met Luis
Somoza. The latter stated he is going to Egypt, Italy and
West Germany. On his return he will stop in Washington to speak
to President Johnson and Attorney General Kennedy concerning
"his plan."
Regarding General Somoza, A-1 mentioned he had no
trouble obtaining the contract for the Dolores from the General.
A-1 will get the document on his next trip to Nicaragua.
10. A-1 was asked if there were any difficulties in Costa
Rica. A-1 stated there was "a little trouble," but nothing of
major importance. Cornelio Orlich had spoken to A-1 during
his last visit and the former had stated that there would be
some grumbling on the part of the Government of Costa Rica
but this was intended only to placate the opposition. Cornelio
Orlich is scheduled to be operated on for an ulcer on 7 April.
Should there be any need to deal with the Costa Rican Government,
A-1 will deal directly with President Orlich. A-1 expects to
see the president on his next tour through Central America.
(There was no indication during this portion of the conversa-
tion that AMWORLD would be asked to leave Costa Rica.) A-1
was asked if he still stood by his original guess on Cornelio's
age, that is, 73. Martin informed A-1 that reports we had
received indicated him to be in his 50's. A-1 stated if he is
50 he looks like 73. A-1 asked if we wanted toknow his exact
age. A-1 was told not to go to any trouble to obtain it; we
would just like to know for our own information.
11. Reports received by A-1 indicate Adelaida should
presently be at Disneyland.

SCART
20 Mar 64
SUBJECT: Appearance of Manuel ARTIME Buesa at the A.R.E.C. Session
on 18 Mar 64 in the Everglades Hotel, Miami.
At exactly 1550 hours, 18 Mar 64, Manuel ARTIME Buesa appeared
before A.R.E.C. members. ARTINE spoke for one hour and twenty
minutes, finishing his speech at 1710 hours. During that time he
answered questions from the audience.
ARTIME dedicated the first hour of his speech to "presenting his
credentials" (that is how he called what he was going to say). During
that hour he gave a recount of his actions, beginning with the letter
of resignation which he sent to Fidel CASTRO in Cuba, and then reading
excurpts from things published in exile by the M.R.R. and from his
"Political Testament" which he claimed to have written in the Guatemala
training base in the 24 hours preceding the departure for the Bay of
Pigs invasion, etc., etc., up to the present time. He finished that
part of his speech by da laring that he respected the Constitution of
1940, that he was fighting against a system not against one
man, and
that he would continue to fight after the fall of Pidal CASTRO Rus if
another dictatorship ware established in Cuba-either a rightist or a
leftist dictatorship--or if it was simply an at ampt to exchange Fidel
for another person, no matter who it might be.
Then he said that many porsons said he was an extreme rightist and
others said he was an extreme leftist, that oth said he was an
imbitious individual, and others said he was in opportunist.
That all
could answer to those who said he was an extremist was that he did
not like extremes, either of the right or left, because these extremos
always ended by touching each other. That to thow who said he was an
ambitious individual he replied that yes, he was ambitious, but that his
ambition was for his name to be spoken with respect soms day in his country
That he had the ambition that at least, after his death, it would be saids
was worthy man. That, in short, what he had was a great ambition
for History. That to those who said he was an opportunist he could sayı

the same ideas since I appeared in the public light, and they are here
in my Political Testament and in other declarations and documents which
I have made and written. For those reasons I cannot be an opportunist.
He also said that he had knocked, was knocking and would continue to
knock on all doors to get assistance for the liberation of Cuba. That
he classified men into two categories only, worthy men and unworthy men,
and there were no other differences. That to him are men were equal,

That he has known and knows many worthy men from all regimes, etc., etc.,

Questions and Answers:
Following are some of the most outstanding questions and answers:
Questions A man who said he was named Filiberto RIVERO and that
worked for a TV station at Los Angeles, California, asked the
following question. "Mr. ARTIME, I am going to ask you a strong question
which therefore requires a previous explanation. Some time ago one of
your representatives in Los Angeles told me you would be going to that
city and I was going to ask you this question, but you did not go. Now
that I have the opportunity I am going to ask this question to you.
The question is this: In Los Angeles and other places there are rumors
that in certain U.S. circles, which are described as extreme liberals,
they have the plan of using some Cubans--like you, for example--to keep
:
rest of the Cubans entertained making them think they will go to war
when the fact is that their plan is very different. The plan consists
of not having that war and thus be able to show, in a few years, how
peaceful coexistence is possible. My question is this: Have you ever
considered that you might be the Cuban who has been chosen for this
and that you might still not be aware of 147 -
it?
Answer: “I don't know whather such a plan exists or not, what I
can guarantee to you is that I would not be the Cuban chosen for that.
um precisoly supported by the group which is opposed to those liberals,
the group of Latin American men who fear just that, not by the U.S.

but by the countries of those Latin Americans. I am a Latin American
product, not another kind of product. I am receiving help from Latin
America and that is why I cannot be chosen for that plan. Maybe others
are being selected for that. (Ovation.)
Then
Question: A lady in the audience, not a member of A.R.E.C., who
said she was a teacher from Las Villas province, Cuba, asked the next
question. She began by saying in brief words the help which she had
given to insurgents in Las Villas province, etc., etc., and that she had
had to leave Cuba because three of her boys had been executed.
she asked ARTIME: "Why isn't help given to those insurgents?"
Answer: ARTIE said that he did not understand Americans.
said that last week, precisply last week, help had been sent to those
insurgents. That unfortunately it was not all that it should be, but it
was something. He explained that it is necessary to use small and fast
boats and for that reason heavy cargoes cannot be taken, and that it is
only possible to make two trips in one night to the Cuban coast and for
that reason the help cannot be more effective. That at any rate, they

infiltrating arms, shoes, boots, food and technicians in the handling
of armament. He clarified that the function of the technicians was to
teach the handling of weapons to the peasants and also to unite tham.
ARTIME then told the same lady that the person for whom she was asking
precisely where he could help those over there, and for that reason
not in that room. (He was referring to a púrson for whom the lady had
inquired whan he accompanied her from the seat to the microphone, as the
spoke very softly, and the audience asked her to go the microphone
her question so all could hear her.)
Questions Another member of the audience asked the following
questions "Mr. ARTIMIS, we understand--through announcements that have
hen published that Mr. RAY or JURE will go to unbe in the coming months,
there are rumors about another organization doing the same thing.
Are you thinking in some tition of that type to counteract the effects
those possible actions, in favor of your movement?

Answers ARTIB gave the following answers "If they go to Cuba,
may God be with them. But I hope it won't be a demagogic action in
which mon will die to give prestige to others. Let me tell you that
we don't make public what we do or plan to do. Some people want
publicity for their actions, but we put the liberation of Cuba before
publicity.
Comments: In the reporting agent's opinion, nothing new was said
this public appearance. The "presentation of credentials" was already
too well known to the audience. The only thing which called attention
was his clear position of opposing any maneuver to try to impose a
"Fidelismo without Fidel" which the majority of the audience interpreted
meaning Manuel RAY Rivero. Even though ARTINE did not nama RAY,
his implications were quite clear the same as the look on his face when
was asked something in connection with JURE.

FROM:
SUBJECT: Opinions about Manuel ARTIME Buesa's TV appearance on
Sunday, 29 Mar 64.
1. Marcos RODRIGUEZ Menéndez, M.D.C. Executives
ARTIME showed true leadership qualities. It was a blessing
for lawyers when he referred to the 1940 Constitution. He was very
good when he said that he was for unity and called all Cubans to war
without making any differences among them for their tendencies.
2. José Antonio VALLE (mat, unk.), Miami News distribution manager,
attorney, mine owner in Oriente province:
ARTIME is a fake and an egotist, but he is a genius in politics.
He scored a win when he said that he did not have time to answer on a
political basis because they were at war. RAY and ARTIME are fighting
'
for their future in Cuba. They must be left alone until the Cubar, problem
is solved because I don't know which of the two is worse.
3. Angel HERNANDEZ Rojo, member of the D.R.E. &
t
ARTIME is a "yes man" who does not have his own opinion about
what he wants and he unconditionally subjected to the "dollar" without
caring for anything else. The D.R.E. has something ponding with ARTIME
because on one occasion, prior to the Bay of Pigs invasion, he took
over
base which the D.R.E. had in Puerto Rico.

When the balance of the money ($27,000) is sent to
A-1 for the Atlantic-Chesapeake we will also send the $132,000

9. AMWORLD-2 has been told by A-1 to close the Swiss

AMYUM-19 when account has been closed in order that the
information can be relayed to Mike GUERTLER (P).

the rest of the infiltration people now in Miami to Costa.

done in a manner similar to the transfer of sabotage equip-

INTRODUCTION: In the period 6 to 18 January 1964,
AMBIDDY-1 was given 83 hours of tutorial training, in JMWAVE safe-
house facilities, on existing operational doctrine and management
techniques applicable to a major clandestine effort against PBRUMEN.
A copy of the training schedule which was used in this tutorial
training is attached. At the completion of the training course,
the various training instructors submitted an evaluation on
AMBIDDY-1. These evaluations are outlined in the following
paragraph.
2. EVALUATIONS: The below-listed evaluations were prepared
by the instructors who participated primarily in Phase I of
AMBIDDY-1's tutorial training. The Phase I instruction concentrated
on imparting to AMBIDDY-1 current operational doctrine relative to
unconventional warfare techniques. The evaluations are as follows:
AMBIDDY-1.
.
Small Unit Operations and Training the training on
responded most enthusiastically to all aspects of the training on
small unit techniques. He made detailed notes on the material
covered, and these notes included copies of training charts and
diagrams. AMBIDDY-1 displayed particularly intensive interest in
that portion of the training dealing with the principles of
survival and the issuance of individual equipment. In the course
of the training, AMBIDDY-1 was given several practical tactical
problems to solve. AMBIDDY–1's solutions to these problems were
logical and reflected a grasp of the techniques to which he had.
been exposed during the training sessions. Thomas L. DARGUZIS was
the primary instructor in this phase of the training, and he assessed
AMBIDDY-1 as being an intelligent, alert, highly-motivated
individual who has a realistic appraisal of his own limitations.
and capabilities.
Clandestine Activity: AMBIDDY-1 received extensive
training in #Itradecraft subjects, including the nature and
element of clandestine activity, security, cover, compartmentation,

organization of a basic net, communications and reporting techniques.
In the course of this training, AMBIDDY-1 expressed a particular
interest in the subjects of security, cover and compartmentation.
Charles F. MASENGILL was the primary instructor for this bloc of
training," and he reports that AMEIDDY-1 was a keen student who
appreciated the opportunity to learn as much as possible about
clandestine operations. MASENGILL believes that AMBIDDY-1 at the
completion of his training was probably weakest on the topic of
how to report intelligence information.
AMBIDDY-1
c. Resistance Activity and Guerrilla Warfare:
received training on the principles and concepts inherent in
organizing an infiltration team, In addition, he was trained
relative to the principles of organizing a resistance net.
Additionally, he was trained in caching, demolition and sabotage
techniques. AMBIDDY-l also received instruction in the principles
and concepts of guerrilla warfare. AMBIDDY-1 was also given an
opportunity to familiarize himself, through actual range firing,
with those weapons which are normally used by anti-AMTHUG-1 forces.
Alton T. PIRNACK was the principal instructor for this bloc of
training. PIRNACK reports that AMBIDDY-1 was responsive to the
subject material which was presented to him. 'AMBIDDY-1 did not
hesitate to ask questions nor to seek clarification of points which
hẹ did not clearly understand. AMBIDDY-1 did indicate that he was
a neophyte in the subject of PM operations, and, as a result, he
was most appreciative of the training which he was receiving on
these subjects. It was evident during this bloc of training that
caching was an entirely new facet of clandestine operations for
AMBIDDY–1.
2
·
3. COMMENT: Phase II of AMBIDDY-1's training concentrated
on exposing AMBIDDY-1 to those management techniques and principles
which are applicable to a major clandestine operation against a
target like PBRUMEN. This part of the training was carried out
exclusively by Andrew K. REUTEMAN and Stanley R. ZAMKA. In this
phase of the training, AMBIDDY-1 constantly expressed a great deal
of enthusiasm for the subject material which was being presented.
Throughout the training, AMBIDDY-1 gave every indication that he
was absorbing the major portion of the training. At the same
time, it was clear that he was overwhelmed by the material and the
implications of what this training meant in terms of his conduct in
future operations. After the management phase of AMBIDDY-1's
training was completed, REUTEMAN and ZAMKA reviewed the 83 hours
training program in its totality with AMBIDDY-1. In addition, the
program was reviewed with all of the instructors who participated
in the training. As a result of this review, a consensus was
reached that%3B while AMBIDDY-1 is an intelligent and responsive
student, the training which he received does not qualify him for
the position of senior officer in a major clandestine undertaking
against PBRUMEN. The training did, however, alert. AMBIDDY-1 to a
number of problems and pitfalls which he should avoid in his
activities. This training also provided certain guide posts for
AMBIDDY-1, but these guide posts were laid out in such a concentrated
dose that they cannot be considered as an adequate substitute.

While HAWLOTT feels that AMING-2 is usually quite reliable and
objective on general political reporting, his own participation
in exile politics and political ambitions could conceivably
influence his objectivity. In an effort to check the accuracy
of ANING-2's remarks, the CO again discussed the interviews with
AKING-2 on 18 Harch at which time AMING-2 repeated his account
of the interview without any change in text, so that the CG.
is inclined to accept AMING-2's account as generally accurate.
2. During the last week of January AMBANG-1 told Source
private meeting in San Juan, Puerto Rico that he would like
enlist Source's assistance as an advisor on medical affairs and
as a propaganda worker. Source, per PBRUMEN custom, requested
that AMBANG-1 explain to Source what resources he had for the
Riberation of PBRUMEN and anked AMBANG-1 to offer preef why he
should consider himself a leader. Soures claims AMBANG-1 replied
that he had boats and weapons sufficient for strong military
action into PRRUMEN and would be able to place combat forces in

training installations, one of which was reported to be the
property of ABANG/1. AMBANG,'1 replied that he had training
installations on the Florida mainland and had training and
logistical bases or a base in Venezuela.
3. Source asked AKBANG/1 what backing he had from World
Powers for the invasion of PBRUMEN. AMBANG/1 replied that he
still had significant White House contacts despite the death
of John F. Kennedy. He added that he was in contact with top
personnel of ODACID and held regular meetings with a very high
ranking officer of KUBARK. He stated he also had been introduced
by the KUBARKER to the Chief of Operations at YOACRE and was in
regular communication with the ODOATH officer. In general,
AMBANG/1 stated, his sources of funds were largely ODYOXE.
Source then asked if he was to understand that AMBANG/1 had th
approval of CDYOKE for operations into PBRUMEN. AMBANG/1
reportedly replied "I have been given the green light".

Around 1 February Source net in San Juan with AMBIDDY/1
for a private talk. ANBINDY/1 suggested that Source associate
himself with AMBIDDY/l's movement in order to help form a post-
liberation goverment. Source replied that he was rather vague
as to AMBIDDY/1's plans and backing. AMBIDDY/1 stated that he
had been selected by ODYOKE as that PBRUMENER having the necessary
leadership and experience for the overthrow of ANTHUG. Source
asked if he understood correctly that AMBIDDY/1 was telling his
that he had the approval of ODYOKR. If so, why was AMBIDDY/1
draving support from Venezuela and from Central American
Governments. AMBIDDY/1 reportedly replied that he did not
actually rely on Venezuela and other Latin American donors for
his assistance, since he was receiving all his logistical and
financial support from KUBARK. Source stated that he had heard
that AMBIDDY/1 was amassing a formidable invasion force in
Micaragua, Costa Rica and Panaman CZ. AMBIDDY/1 replied that
he had been given very large sums of money, which proved the
reliance which CDYOKE had in him and made obvious the fact that
ODYOKE had selected him to bring about the liberation of PREUHEI
Source asked why it was that ODYUKE and KUBARK would select

ANING/3 asked both AMBIDDY/1 and AMBANG/1 during his

Puerto Rico signified that the two leaders had met or planned

AMBIDDY/1 nor AEBANG/1 denied nor confirmed Source'a questions,

not not, but hoped to meet for talks.

SYNOPSIS OF AMBIDDY-1'S SPEECH TO AREC
18 March 1964
"You will forgive me if before a gathering the Agrupacion de

or technical analysis of the reconstruction of Cuba, the reason
is very simple, it is because I don't know.
Inasmuch as I do not
like to talk about things which I know nothing of I prefer not to
touch upon the subject. Here at this gathering there are men more
capable than I
men who will have the difficult task of the
reconstruction of Cuba upon their shoulders.
I want to talk about what I know about.

I have the pleasure of speaking to some of its members separately

Because I know our movement is very controversal. They say we are
of the extreme right, they say we are of the extreme left, they say

I believe it is our duty to mention them here or anywhere else. .
First of all I do not believe in extremes

Cuba, in the case of the extreme right by imposing a dictatorship;
in both cases we shall continue to fight with our weapons in hand,

AMBIDDY-1 goes on to mention his various publications.
describes his first publication, "Communism por que?” (Communism
what for?) which he wrote nine months prior to Castro coming to
power. The main theme of this pamphlet, according to A-1, vas
that more than changing a government what is needed is a change in
men's conscience. The pamphlet also outlined the duties of the
padron (land owner) to the workers so that the latter may lives
in dignity and in honor. The patron should feel that the problems
of his workers are also his problems. The worker. in k turn has
certain obligations to the patron. If this quid pro quo is not
adhered to the (Christian) government has the right to intervene
for the common good.
Later on, after Castro was in power, A-1 wrote his letter of
resignation accusing Castro of being a communist and traitor.
In this letter A-1 mentions he resigned because Castro had not been
honest with the businessmen by not telling them their property
would be confiscated.
A-1 then went into exile and there he published a book called
Traiccion (Betrayal). This book clearly outlined the ide llogyy of
the movement.
"We believe the state should forment and simulate private
economy both national as well as in foreign. [During the Bay of
Pigs I wrote my political thesis. We have to have an effective
democracy in Latin America. I say effective democracies because

A-1 then alludes to the Alliance for Progress which he refers
to as an Alka Seltzer in the Pacific. He maintains he is not against
the Alliance for Progress but rather that something should also be
done for Cuba.
Question and answer petiod
Question: I understand that in certain sections of the United
States Government there exist ultra liberals who believe that
communist Cuba could be used as an experimental ground and in the
coming years communist Cuba could be used as a proving ground for
the coexistence of the great world powers, that is, Russia and the
U. S. The question is Dr. Artime, have you considered deep in your
conscience the possibility that the U. S. Government is using you
and your movement to occupy the Cubans who wish to liberate their
homeland with other activities so that they cannot liberate their
country with the force and enthusiasm they desire.
'
The question is
have you considered the possibility that you, under your best
intentions, are the instrument by which these ultra liberal forces
in the U. S. can paralyze the liberating activity of the Cuban people?
answer: A very good question. If the U. S. were giving me something
this might be true but I believe the ones who are receiving aid,
possibly other ultra: liberals, may be in collusion with the U.
This is very possible. can make a mistake. I can make two mintshen

against Tito. We are as much opposed to the totalitarian left as
we are oppɔsed to the fascist right.
"They continue to call us extremist.
We don't care. They
will continue to call us rightist or leftist, fascist, philo-
communist. I recall the words of Don Quixote when he was passing ở
on the outskirts of a small town and Sancho said to Don Quixote,
Don Quixote replied, "Let them,
Sir, the dogs are barking at us.'
Sancho, if they are barking it is because we are moving. And
we will continue to move.
"
"They say we are very ambitious. Yes, we are very ambitious.
We have an ambition which blinds us and we are disposed to give
our lives for that ambition.
An ambition for what? That in the
coming days when Cuba is liberated people will pronounce our
name with respect in our country."

the rest of
the Western World." A-1 maintains that the situation today is much
the way Lenin would have hoped for. Britain and France have recog-
nized Red China; the U. S. is at odds with these two governments.
This, A-1 maintains, is exactly what Lenin would have wanted. A-1
then quotes Lenin, "Within 30 years we will embark on a peace
offensive, of coexistence and we will split the free nations and
smash the impotent bourgeois."
"The battle ground for Latin America lies 90 miles from our
shores in a place called Cuba. Should the Westen world lose this
battle the sleeping giant (Latin America) will wake up on the side
of the communist camps. Then it would be preferable to be dead
because the free world will have ceased to be.

bad doors are the ones that have been closed to us in order to
lock Cuba within them.

Answer: Very good question. Very good. A North American friend
of mine once said he would rather carry ten cats in a bag than work
with two Cubans. I said to him that he was quite right; however,
Cubans are not the only ones that are hard to understand.
Latin American is also difficult to understand. Thank God, we are
very individualistic and that is why the communists are having such
difficult time. Because we are very individualistic. The war
is the only thing which can unite the Cubans. The only thing which
can create an unbreakable bond, betweennrich, poor, Negroes, whites,
Catholics, Protestants, Mason, everyone, is sacrifice. I do not
believe in theoretical unions.

AMWORLD Meeting in New Orleans, 24 June 1964
SUBJECT: ANYUM-19 or Nice Guys Finish Last
1. HQS conclusion that AMWORLD interests would best be
served by not opposing the termination of liaison contacts
with AMYUM-19 was prompted by some of the following con-
siderations:
AMBIDDY–1's obvious displeasure with the existing
relationship, as evidenced by his rather pointed ob-
servations about the corrupting effects of such contacts
Ga subordinate levels. The fact that such contacts provide
KUBARK with a certain insight into those AMWORLD affairs
which AMBIDDY-1 prefers to keep secret is obviously a
factor, but not an overriding one, What really worries
AMBIDDY-1 is--he claims--that factionalism drave suste-
_mance from working level liaison between Cubans and
Americans except in those rare instances where the
loyalty of the Cuban representative is beyond cavil.
AMBIDDY-1's lack of confidence in ANYUM-19's
loyalty. HQS position has been all along that AMBIDDY-1
is the sole judge of who among his co-workora merit
trust and who doesn't. To dispute his judgment would
entangle KUBARK into intra-AMWORLD power politics with
no adequate basis for intelligent juda sent. Either we
reserve ourselves the right of co-determination on all
perecanel action or on none. AMWORLD groundrules ar
unambiguỡan on that score. We do not become involved
except in those instances where our opinions are
specifically elicited, as in the field of background ·
checka which only by inference bear upon the issue of
loyalty to AMBIDDY-1. In sum, once AMBIDDY-1 withdraws
his confidence from a co-worker we have no log to stand
en in persisting that we have the right to consider that
particular individual our chosen instrument in the field
of liaison.

x
AMBIDDY-1 called this office to say that Luis
TOMAS Rey and Eladio BAS Trespalacios could mot sail because
they were unable to obtain their re-entry permits.
Since
these two could not obtain their permits "the people" had
told Amado MUNNE Pantaleon that it was not worthwhile for him
to go.
Martin asked AMBIDDY-1 if any mention had been made.
concerning TOMAS's skin rash and that he did not see a
doctor. AMBIDDY-1 stated that he had not been so informed
by AMYUM-19. AMBIDDY- was asked if the only reason BAS:
and TOMAS could not leave was because they could not obtain
their re-entry permits. AMBIDDY-1 answered that was the
sole reason and that all three wanted to go desperately.
AMBIDDY-1 agreed that under any condition MUNNE should go
since he is the most important of the three.

AMBIDDY-1 would call this office at 1800 in order
receive a more concrete answer to this situation.

Martin asked AMBIDDY-1 if the suitcase containing
the uniforms had been sent. AMBIDDY-1 does not know.
However, he will investigate and if the uniforms have not
been sent, AMBIDDY-1 will bring them to the Consejo meeting
on 19 March.

ANWORLD--Talk with AMBIDDY-1
'
AMBIDDY-1 will be meeting with us in the Washington
lehouse on 19-20 March. If you can spare the time, it
might be helpful if you could have a heart-to-heart talk
with him on his relations with Senora Padron, which may be
blossoming forth inte matrimony. There cannot be much
doubt now that she is reputed to have been Fulgencio
Batista's mistress and that this fact (if fact it be) is
videly known. If he marries her, the political repercus-
sions could be calamitous. It would be helpful if you
could tell AMBIDDY-1 point blank that if scandal onsues,¨
this could down the program.

Answer: There are many, madan, who are now helping.
This

we would like but went some. We also have to send not just weapons.
but food, shoes, etc. The guerrillas lack everything. The problem
of supplying them is very difficult but we are trying. We do not
have sufficient beats. To arrive at the coast we cannot use large
ships but small beats and these small boats have a limited capacity.
These small boats can only make two trips in one day and no more.
It is being done on a small scale but it is being done. The force
to liberate Cuba is there inside Cuba and it is up to us to assist
them...
Question: Dector, don't you have any confidence in the OAS.
I refer specifically to the recent cache of arms discovered in
Venezuela?
Answer: I admire the Venezuelan people, I admire Venezuelan
democracy and if a strong measure is taken against Cuba, because of
the just screams of the Venezuelan people and if the OAS listens
to these screams, I will admire the CAS.

Telephone Conversation with AMBIDDY-1 and
Raul Hernandez (as Martin Ferrer)
DATE : 14 March 1964, 1230 hours
1. AMBIDDY-1 would like to have a meeting with the
Consejo as soon as possible to talk over many outstanding
problems and to discuss thoroughly the new budgetary pro-
cedure. Martin informed A-1 that this would be brought to
Henry's attention upon his return. A-1 is speaking to the
Agrupacion para la Reconstruccion Economica de Cuba on
Wednesday, 18 March, so he cannot make it for that date.
2. A-1 advised that Luis Entialgo has accepted the
offer to work for AMWORLD and will be returning from Spain
shortly.
3. A-1 has not yet heard from the Filipino and requests
that we check into this matter.
"
A-1 was asked for his opinions concerning the DMJM
people. A-1 is very pleased with the survey and feels that
the engineers plans are reasonable and fitting to his project.
A-1 estimated, however, that the total figure may be in the
$300,000 category. This is another subject which A-1 would
like to discuss in the next seting.
"
5. Another topic he wants to discuss is the transfer
of the C-47 to Nicaragua.
6. A-1 informed us that "key personnel" are no longer
listed on the budget, however, there are individuals which
fall into the category of guerrillas and infiltrators who
are in Miami and are receiving retainers.
7. A-1 was informed that the propagation charts for the
month of April are on their way to him.

could obtain the approval of the government to engage in this
type of business. It appears to A-1 that Vico Starke did
present the contraband pro position to Cornelio Orlich and
received tacit approval. A-l informed both. Cornelio and
Vico that since it was their country they could do as they
pleased, however, he would not permit his vehicles to be used
for this purpose.
His main concern was to liberate Cuba and
•
not to engage in the internal affairs of Costa Rica. His
only desire is to be left alone so he can work effectively.
C.
What is Figueres' role in this? A-1 replied that
he had not seen any indications that Figueres had been
involved. Although he and Vico Starke are close friends,
they are political enemies.
d. What were his specific charges against Cabezas?
A-1 stated:
(1) The main charge against Cabezas was his
collusion with Vico Starke to subordinate AMWORLD
the MCRL.
(2) Cabezas held a meeting with Vico Starke's
brother and Rafael Calderon without authorization or
informing A-1.
:
When A-1 initially confronted Rolando Cabezas, the latter
refused to answer any of A-l's questions. At a later
meeting Cabezas confessed that the reason why Vico Starke
had wanted control of the MRR was for the contraband
whisky. A-1 feels that this contraband whisky was just
an alibi and the main motive had been to overthrow the
Costa Rican Government.
"
Will Vico Starke accept defeat or will he try again
to control our movement? A-1 feels that vico Starke no
longer poses a direct menace to his organization. Starke
has been removed as the intermediary to Cornelio Orlich.
Starke, however, is still in close contact with Cornelio
Orlich. A-1 emphasized that Vico Starke will not be per-
mitted to enter the camps, mainly GUILLOT, even though it
is on his estate..

DATE

1. Martin began the conversation by welcoming A-1 home.
2. Martin stated that he had a message from Henry which
would have been sent out today had A-l still been in Costa Rica.
There were a few questions that Henry would like answered:
Since the Consejo had no previous indications of
Calderonista attempts to overthrow the government, we
would appreciate any additional information A-1 might have.
A-I began by saying that Vico Starke had had meetings with
Francisco Calderon. Calderon's brother, Rafael, had been
very friendly with Vico Starke's brother as of late. Vico
Starke's brother had been at GUILLOT ever since the first
arrival of the AMWORLD contingent. Rafael Calderon had a
meeting in GUILLOT with Vico Starke's brother of an unknown
nature. A-1 considers the Calderonistas the main opposition
to the government. Other substantiating reports had roached
Figuls, the head of security for the Costa Rican Government.
Vico Starke had placed old Calderonista elements in key
positions within the MCRL. A-1 gave Col. Figuls as his
source of information. Vico Starke had wanted to place these
old Calderonista elements within the AMWORLD organization
in a supervisory capacity and they also would have the
final say within AMWORLD.
b. What did A-1 mean by other reports reaching Cornelio
Orlich and are you certain Starke not acting in concert
with Orlichs. A-1 replied that Cornelio had received other
report through his intelligence section, however, Cornelio
had placed very little credence in them. Cornelio visited

message sent to him in Costa Rica, however he did not receive
the accompanying message. A-1 was asked to find out why the
private link message did not reach him. Also, it was explained
to A-1 who "El Narizon" is.
4. A-1 was casually asked if there would be any objection
to ANYUM-19 attending any of the Consejo meetings. A-1 had no
objections.
5. A-1 has some motion pictures and photographs of the
bases and will bring them to the next Consejo meeting.
6. A-1 was informed that a letter from Luis Sierra, chief
of the guerrillas, was intercepted by his own people in Miami.
This letter contained a photograph with Sierra and other members
of the guerrilla teams dressed in their new uniforms. A-1 was
asked to investigate how this letter had been sent from the base
and also how Sierra was able to have the picture developed.
+
7. This brought up the subject of Manuel Gomez. A-1
said that Gomez will be leaving on Monday, 16 March, for
Nicaragua to survey AMWORLD installations. A-1 had just a
few hours previously spoken to Gomez. In the conversation,
Gomez elaborated on the security measures he wishes A-1 to
take concerning his own security. A-1 continues to sing the
praises of Gomez. A-1 also commented that he has noticed a
marked improvement in the security of his personnel since
the last time he was in Miami.
White in Costa Rica, A-1 detected being followed by
another car. A-1 was able to lose the surveiller. Martin
took this opportunity to stress to A-1 the need for increasing
his personal security measures such as more body guards and
more secrecy concerning his movements.
9. The ADELAIDA arrived in Hollywood o/a 8 March. A-1
was not able to examine the contents of the sabotage equipment
due to his preoccupation in Costa Rica with the MCRL and Vico
Starke. The ADELAIDA onloaded weapons from the barge and sailed
for Nicaragua..
10. AMJAVA-4, AMWORLD-2 and "the Mexican" will leave
together for Nicaragua on 16 March.
11. A-1 expressed an interest in moving the C-47 out of
Costa Rica. A-1 would like to discuss the method of transfer
with the Consejo.

1. AMBIDDY-1 began the conversation by saying that the
reason he had been late in checking was that he had been at
meeting with the DMJM engineers. A series of items had been
discussed on which A-1 would like to have our suggestions.
A-1 expressed the desire to meet with the Consejo as soon as
possible in order not to give the impression to the DMJM people
that he was being masterminded by someone else. Martin explained
to A-1 that Henry was currently out of town, but that his request
for a meeting would be brought to Henry's attention upon his
return. A-1 went on to say that the deadline for the budget to
be submitted is close at hand which also adds to the urgency
for a meeting.
2. Martin asked A-1 if he had checked his Post Office:
box. A-1 replied yes. A-1 was then asked to confirm or deny.
the rumor concerning Santiago Alvarez which alleged that A-1
has given him full autonomy within AMWORLD. A-1 said that he
has not had a chance to talk to Santiago Alvarez since his
return to Miami, but would do so soon. A-1 stated, however, that
when he had approached Santiago Alvarez, the latter was informed.
he could bring with him "a mechanic or two," but A-1 never
authorized Santiago Alvarez to bring his entire group en masse...
.
3. A-1 advised that the radio link between Miami and
Costa Rica has been established. A-1 was told that there woul
be no need to obtain a HAM radio license to operate. Should
his organization be approached by the local authorities con-
cerning the operation of the radio, they are to plead ignorance
of the law and stop transmitting. This information was obtained
from Jim Smith 7 A-1 mentioned that he had received the dummy

1. Has there been an open break between. Starke and the
Orlichs? A-1 stated that at the beginning of the crisis
there had been a break between Starke and Cornelio Orlich,
however, Starke has been able to smoothen the rupture by
telling Cornelio Orlich that his main interest in controlling
the MRĤ vas for financial gains through the contraband trade.
8. Is Cabezas your main source on Starke and Calderon?
A-1 commented that cabezas had been one of his sources, but
also Col. Figuls plus reports given to A-1 by his own people
in the camps. However, his main source was the facts which
speak for themselves.
3.
.
Changing the subject, Martin asked A-1 why he could not
go to Guatemala. A-1 explained that what he had wanted to say
in his message was that at this particular time Guatemala would
have to be ruled out because his passport showed an exit from
Mercedes Airport in Nicaragua. However, this did not preclude
future meetings in Guatemala. A-1 apologized if he had given us
the wrong impression in his message.
4. A-1 stated that within the coming week he might want to
have a special meeting with the Consejo concerning the latest
political developments in Costa Rica.
5. A-l is forwarding us a tape on Honduras and Costa Rica
as soon as possible.
6. A-1 is not satisfied with the developments in Nicaragua
and with Iglesias in particular. A-1 implied that the main
problem may be the funding mechanism in Nicaragua and misuse of
AMWORLD funds. A-l is sending AMWORLD-2, who is a public
accountant, to review the financial situation there.
97.
'
A-1 was asked to service his post office box since
there are several letters waiting for him..
A-1 expects to meet with the DMJM people, who are now
in Miami, along with ANWORLD-2 and AMJAVA-4.
9. It was requested of A-1 that he precede any Consejo
messages which require immediate attention with the word'
"URGENTE" so that members of this office will not needlessly
be called at all hours of the night. A-l agreed.
10. A-1 was reminded that we still have not received
AMWORLD-2's report regarding his interview with Eusebio Mujal.

which AMYUM-19 belongs), liaison with AMWORLD conducted
through AMYUM-19 ipso facto involves KUBARK in factional
strife. We recall that some of the major troubles be-
setting the action mechanism prior Playa Giron stemmed
from the interference of political commissars Without
derogating from the importance of the ideological
component in the struggle against AMTHUG, in any showdown
between the military command and the political functionary
corps, it behooves us to range KUBARK alongside the
former unless the points at issue manifestly implicate
PEPRIME security. Under AMWORLD groundrules KUBARK
supports AMBIDDY-1 as the commander of an unconventional
warfare instrument, not an exile organization, let alone
the ideology: and aspirations which animate it.
d. The ANYUN opposition group represented by ANBUR–15
clearly desires a share in the decision-making proce6898
which KUBARK has entrusted to AMBIDDY-1. While they pay
lip service to the principle of non-interference in
purely military affairs, in the final analysis it would
be impossible to keep the two aspects apart. Any con
cessions on KUBARK's part to the pretensions of the
ANTUN opposition would confront KUBARK with intangibles
in the form of occult pressures brought to bear upon
AMBIDDY-1 whose impact we could not possibly gauge or
control.
AHYUM dissidence flourishes in the WAVE area,
wh
AMWORLD's center of gravity rests in Central
America. Unless AMBIDDY-1's stewardship-in unimpeded by
AMYUN factionalism, AMWORLD's performance is bound to
suffer since. AMBIDDY-1's preoccupations will always
retain focus on his WAVE area backyard..
The impression that ANWORLD may be disintegrating
18 fed by intel which essentially reflects WAVE area
backstage maneuverings in the political sphere, not the
situation in the camps about which we are, as a matter
of fact, relatively uninformed. By striving to insulate
ANWORLD against the vagaries of WAVE area bickering and
strife, the AMWORLD pture is bound to move into clearer
focus and any shortcomings for which AMBIDDY-1 should be
called to account can no longer be blamed upon the
debilitating effects of AMYUM intrigue and-most important…
cannot possibly be blamed upon KUBARK once its links with
ANYUN-15 have been severed.

We passed

' if it is true, in case reporters should question him about
it, but that we felt that the easiest way out of this matter

fairly lightly. In other words, perhaps we could play it

because it was felt that Frank was a bit of a blowhard any.

therefore ought not be blamed upon authoritarianism (without
which AMWORLD cannot conceivably prosper) but upon a leadership
gap in AMBIDDY-1'a personality makeup which even "democratio
centralism" couldn't correct or cure.
4. In assessing the prospective consequences of a cessa-
tion of contact between AMYUM-19 and KUBARK, we shall have to
take into account that he is fully cognizant of the fact that
KUBARK supports AMWORLD. The relationship that has existed
heretofore is known to him in all its facets..

Justly be blamed if not on AMYUM, at least on AMBIDDY-1's
political representation in the WAVE area. With that
representation effectively eliminated, one of the main
sources of ODYOKE discomfiture will have been effectively
dislocated. Impending changes should aï least eliminate
the AMYUN press and intel sections.
1. Should there be further unpleasantness in the
WAVE area, KUBARK will, once contacts with AMYUM-19 have
ceased, have a base for plausible denial of responsibility
for not preventing it.
'
3. If we are to believe certain not altogether
unbiased reports, AMBIDDY-1, through his mistress
Adelaida PADRON, has become linked with the exile demi-
monde which moves on the fringes of common crime and
which is closely intertwined with the remnants of Batista
regime. While AMYUM, and particularly AMYUM-19, may to
some extent serve to counteract and dlow down there trends,
they are obviously unable to halt them entirely. Hence',
what little benefit we could have derived from a tie-in
between ANYUN and AMWORLD has not been forthcoming.
Short of an enduring political compromise between
glicting viewpoints, which we don't consider within the
realm of practical politics, any solution which keeps
AMBIDDY-1 out of the WAVE area and close to his command
post, serves AMWORLD and hence KUBARK interests.

struggle, most ideological reservations ought be subordinated.
Regarding this fundamental issue he and KUBARK may be at odds.
In serving as our principal working level liaison contact, he
has not restated the temptation to try parlaying it into
political power vis-a-vis AMEIDDY-1, a fact that has obviously
not escaped AMBIDDY-l's notice. Without impugning AMYUM–19'■
good faith, we have reason for believing that on occasion he
has conveyed our views in the garb of KUBARK criticism of
AMBIDDY-1's capabilities, e.g., as a paramilitary planner and
it appears, has left AMBIDDY-1 with the completely erroneous
impression that we were taking sides in the factional dispute
involving AMYUM, in essence backing ANYUM-19' against AMBIDDY–1.
In advising AMBIDDY-1 on the pros and cons of dismissing.
SAMBORA (P), AMYUL-19 told AMBIDDY-1 that dismissal would in
all probability spell a break with KUBARK which he must have
known and of which he was subsequently reminded, ran completely
counter to KUBARK's oft stated position that personnel matters
are in AMBIDDY-1's hands. By implication, at least, he may
have reinforced AMBIDDY-1's suspicions that RAMBORA was linked
with KUBARK. apparently AMBIDDY-1 has not been unduly
influenced by ANYUN 19's continuous harping on the threat"
posed by AMBANG-1 (ARYUM-19 was never shaken in his conviction
that AMBANG-1 receives KUBARK support). Another bete noire
has now reared its ugly head in the person of Oliva.
1
ANTUM-19's ideological preoccupations have seriously
ſtracted from his performance as a liaison contact. As a
de facto penetration of AMYUN and as a source of personality
information he has done well by KUBARK. Thanks to him KUBARS
undoubtedly now has a much clearer understanding of the
interlock between AMWORL) and AHYUM, although we shall have
to observe the course of events before accepting AMYUM–19'■
promise that they are Siamese twins who if surgically separated
will hemorrhage to death. We owe him a debt of gratitude to
have alerted us to the impending rift and to have, enabled us
to arrive at the only possible decision, 1.e., to throw the
full weight of KUBARK's support behind AMBIDDY-1. Through him
ve have also learned a great deal bout AMBIDDY-1's malient
characteržation as a leader, of course making due allowance
for a subtle injection of AMYUM 19'a venon. In fairness to
ARBEDDY-1 it should be stated that some of the characteristión
to which ANTUM-19 takea most violent exception, even if they
are ingrained, have been inculcated into AMBIDDY-1 by KUBARK

Should be in honest conviction reach the conclusion that he was
shunted aside because KUBARK considered him an obstacle to
establishing full sway over AMWORLD, he could easily rationalize
a betrayal. Other "ideological" considerations could be adduced
by him to justify actively opposing KUBARK. Whatever he may
do along those lines would not be through inadvertence but by
design. We have weighed and discarded the possibility of
neutralizing him through recruitment. This would not work if
our reading of his personality is correct. We can think of
number of deterrents, out of KUBARK's reach, which will probably
make him think twice before throwing down the gauntlet. To
provoke the enmity of both AMBIDDY-1 and KÜBARK would be an act
of defiance of which we consider: AMYUM-19 incapable. Besides,
AMYUM-19 strikes us as an indivudal imbued with a sense of basic
decency and of Christian morality.
In balance we doubt whether AMYUM-19 is going to pose
major threat to the security of AMWORLD. In any case, HQS
decision to accede to AMBIDDY-l's desires on working level
liaison, even if it entails a rupture in relations with AMYUK–19,
vas made in full awareness of the fact that he could cause ·
trouble and inflict damage if this be his intent. Should this
come to pass, however, it would be unfair to shift the entire
blame onte AMBIDDY-1. While we can hardly applaud the glaring
lack of political acumen AMBIDUY-1 has displayed in this whole
affair, while his motives in dispensing with AMYUM-19's ser-
vices may not be entirely honorable, and while HOLB, his main
source on the ANTUM cabal, is self serving and questionable to
put it mildly, the fact remains that the final decision was
UBARKE
much as it was AMBIDEV_1's.

ABSTRACT
INCRUFIUN
Transmitted herewith is additional information concerning
AMBIDDY/1's home life which may be of interest to BECKHOFF.
It would be interesting to learn the origin of the recurrent
rumor that the date of the PILON raid was advanced at the
instigation of ODYOKE and that AMBIDDY/1 feels himself betrayed.

1. ANBIDDY-1'a pronceupation with his political image

dictatorial leanings. We replied, in effect, that we enter❤

tions of liberalism and laisses faire with a heavy dose of

by his implied inclusion in the line of succession, A-l only
voiced mild dissent.

AMWORLD-Possible Basis for Entente between AMBIDDY-1 and SAMBORA
ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES
1. We advised SAMBORA at a Washington meeting with him,
16 June 1964, that from the way things look to us he had painted
himself into a corner from which he could not extricate himself.
Another error was to have permitted someone like MOLE to block
his path to the AMWORLD hierarchy. This in retrospect, however,
is all water over the dam.
2. If SAMBORA is to perform his functions as we first con
ceived them he should go to AMBIDDY-1 and arrive at a new understanding.
SAMEORA was informed that we intend to meet AMBIDDY-1 before
SAMBORA returns to Miami. At this meeting we intend to state in
no uncertain terms that the security of the organization is in a
deplorable condition. This perhaps may have the effect of placing
SAMBORA in a more favorable bargaining position.
3. We counseled SAMBORA to negotiate a hard contract which
would encompass at least the following terms:
He would not work under nor be responsible to MOLE
but only to the highest echelons of AMWORLD hierarchy.
b. Full access to all files, bases, information needed
to perform a professional job.

c. The complete and unhesitating support of AMBIDOT-1 in
all security matters.
If Anl is unwilling to accept these terms or offers any restrictings
or conditions SAMBORA has our permission to turn in his badge
and bid AMBIDDY-1 a fond adieu.

ABSTRACT

"
1.
The following AMOT report concerning the not-so-private
affairs of AMBIDDY/1 and his fiancee may be of interest to
BECKHOFF. According to AMYUM/19, AMBIDDY/1 intends to formalize
his relationship with Iden B sometime within the next few months.
The marriage will probably take place in Latin America and Iden
B will make her home there to avoid a public scandal which would
have a harmful effect on the AMYUM organization. Attention is
called to paragraphs 14, 17, and 26 which answer, in part, some of
the questions raised in ref dispatch concerning ODYOKE involvement
in AMWORLD. The Station has forwarded reports of this nature
which concern claims by members of the Cuban exile community of
KUBARK sponsorship of AMBIDDY/1. Of the specifics cited by the
Cuban, intelligent or otherwise, to support their allegations
those statements attributed to the AMWORLD principals themselves
appear to be the only ones which can make a claim to "knowledge"
as opposed to conviction based on AMWORLD's affluence. To date.
no tangible evidence of KUBARK involvement with AMWORLD has come
to our attention.
Source: Iden A.
Source states that she has known AMBIDDY/1 since they
were children in Esmeralda municipal term, Camaguey province, from
where both of them come originally. Source further states she is
also a close friend of Iden B, who is now AMBIDDY/1's mistress
and a homosexual like source (according to source's statements).

13. One time AMBIDDY/1, Iden B and source had a meeting and
discussed who should be the pilot of his private aircraft. Iden
B proposed a pilot named ALEXANDER (according to source, ALEXANDER
had relations with Iden B,) but AMBIDDY/1 opposed this and
complained that the PBPRIMERS forced him to select the personnel.
14. About 7 months ago (on or about Nov. 63), AMBIDDY/1 told
Iden B and source that he was going to receive a secret training
course under PEPRIME direction. AMBIDDY/1 used to leave every
day at 6 AM and come back at night. According to source, the
course lasted 6 weeks and most of the times Iden B used to drive
AMBIDDY/1 in an automobile to a place in Coral Gables where the
course was being given. Every time AMBIDDY/1 returned from the
classes he talked about the things he had learned and talked
about secret writing, codes, of some pens with a substance which
could kill instantaneously, about sabotage methods, etc., etc.
15. AMBIDDY/1 frequently spends long hours at night in his
house making up accounts to justify expenses.
16. After Iden B's divorce, AMBIDDY/1 moved with her to 881
*NE 71st Street. AMBIDDY/1 talks constantly in the house where he
lives with her about his future plans, about the single party,
about the dictatorship which has to be imposed in Cuba, etc.
AMBIDDY/1 often puts on a uniform, poses in front of the mirror an
talks about invasion.
WAVE Comment:
This is one of several recent reports
concerning statements attributed to AMBIDDY/1 in which he has
spoken of the need for a strongman to run Cuba. AMSHADY/1 reports
that on 10 June Aurelio MARIN Naredo (one of approximately 30
AMWORLDERS recently arrived from the camps) states that AMBIDDY/1
appeared at the training camps, took a dictatorial position on a
number of issues terminating with the statements to the effect
that he was the only one to liberate Cuba, he was the only one to
run it later, and that there would be no voting and no elections.
MARIN objected, stating that he had joined a revolutionary group,
hot a dictatorship, and along with other trainees requested to
return to the WAVE area. According to AMSHADY/1 when the trainees
arrived and went to the AMYUM offices to receive their final check
AMJAVA/4 refused, a fight ensued and AMYUM/19 had to intervene.
MARIN characterized AMBIDDY/1 as deceitful, liar, coward, demagogu
dictator, power mad, a flagrant opportunist who cannot be trusted,
etc. Realizing that AMSHADY/1 is strongly prejudiced' against
AMBIDDY/1 this comment is forwarded for what it is worth. AMYUM/1
has confirmed the incident at the AMYUM office and states that,
whether or not it is justified, there is a considerable number of
AMWORLDERS who hold similar views now and who attribute statements
to AMRIDDY/1 which are inconsistant with his previous public.
statements.
17. At the time of President KENNEDY'm death, source asked
AMBIDDY/1 whether this would barm him and he replied smiling that
it did not, that now he was receiving more aid than before.
AMBIDDY/1 told source that he had received a card from Mrs.
Jacqueline KENNEDY in reply to the condolences which he had ment
her, and a card written by Bob KENNEDY with greetings,

18. According to source, AMBIDDY/1 has just given Iden B a
fabulous residence in Miami. According to Iden B, the residence
is in the name of AMWORLD/2," but they wrote another document

9. Source further states that in view of the fact she
(source) has many friends who like "poses", she was able to
introduce to ALBIDDY/1 some important Venezuelans including
Colonel Pulido BARRETO, Carlos SISO (mat. unk.) and Osvaldo
BAJARES (Venezuelan economist). Source states that,
AMBIDDY/1's request, three meetings were held with those
individuals in source's house. According to AMBIDDY/1 the
objective of the meetings was to get support for his plans,
and the objective of the Venezuelans was to overthrow Romulo
BETANCOURT, and they were allied to the National Liberation
Armed Forces (FALN). The conversations revolved around CASTRO
Leon. The Venezuelans believed they could make a pact with
the Communists and later eliminate them. At that time various
members of FALN came to Miami (source doesn't remember when).
AMBIDDY/1 assured the Venezuelans he could influence GPFOCUS
and KUBARK to get support for their cause.
Carlos SISO told source he distrusted AMBIDDY/1 and
believed he was a KUBARK penetration to learn all their plans.
SISO also told source that when Osvaldo BAJARES returned to
Venezuela he had been arrested, and SISO believed AMBIDDY/1
had denounced BAJARES. In the last meeting, SISO told source
that he was going to put AMBIDDY/1 to a test. SISO asked him
"whether it was true he had gone to Haiti on an official mission
as an ODYOKE envoy." AMBIDDY/1 was very surprised and said he
had, but insisted in SISO telling him how he had learned that.
The meetings with the groups of Venezuelans stopped since that
time.
After these happenings, AMBIDDY/1 informed source he
had written a report to the Americans about the Venezuelan
problem, and that he had treated Rafael CALDERAS very well in
this report because CALDERAS had given him financial assistance.
10. AMBIDDY/1 showed source an unbound book and told her
this was the most important book ODYOKE had because it contained
Tilitary secrets which were known to a very few people. AMBIDDY/1
boasted of being one of the few men in the U. S., who had that
document. Source leafed through the book and saw some weapons,
noticing that some of those weapons were marked. AMBIDDY/1
explained that those marked weapons are the ones which AMTHUG/1
has in his possession.
+
11. Source further reports that on various occasions, in
private conversation which AMRIDDY/1 had with Iden B,
.
Ideň☎ and source, he said that when he seizes power in Cuba he
is going to organize guerrillas to invade Mexico and other
countries which have denied help to Cuba. According to source;
AMBIDDY/1 is convinced he will be President and Iden B, First
Lady. ›
When AMBIDDY/1 talks of the 1940 Constitution he says it
must be defended publicly and respected as something sacred, but
in private he has said that when he seizes power he is going to
use every page of the Constitution as toilet paper.
12. Source heard AMBIDDY/1 talk about a book which had been
published which strongly accused KUBARK, and say that he, Iden
3, and Iden F had furnished all the data for this book and
would receive about $8,000.00 as their share of the sale profits.

son. Iden B met BATISTA through Carlos CANTILLO Gonzalez.
Iden B was BATISTA's mistress she was married to Iden C, who is
now in Miami also and has a very bad moral reputation. On
various occasions Iden B has received money from BATISTA, always
through Orlando PIEDRA Negueruela. The last money which she
received, $200.00, was when she was already living with AMBIDDY/1
Iden B has many friends among MASFERRER's people and is a very
close friend of the wife of Enrique MASFERRER Rojas. According
to source, AMBIDDY/1 has had various meetings with Orlando
PIEDRA Negueruela. Quite some time ago (source doesn't remember
exact date). AMWORLD/2 raised $10,000 for AMBIDDY/1 from among
"batistianos." AMWORLD/2 and Orlando PIEDRA owned a gasoline
firm called "Reca", and at present AMWORLD/2 is still on very
good terms with PIEDRA Negueruela.
Iden B used to "pose" with her sister, Iden D, to please
BATISTA and in the presence and with the approval of her husband
Iden C. Iden B is a very close friend of "Flor de Loto", Tete
*MACHADO, Aida* PEREZ Pozo, a woman called Pat (La Americana) and
Natacha* D'ANGELO, all known homosexuals who hold "posing" parties
now in Miami like they used to in Cuba. One time when AMBIDDY/1
went to "Flor de Loto's" house he met Iden A.
5. According to source, Iden B was also the mistress of
Marcos PEREZ Jimenez, former dictator of Venezuela. Iden B met
PEREZ Jimenez through Colonel Pulido* BARRETO who was a friend
of PEREZ Jimenez. Pulido BARRETO put Iden B in contact with an
individual named PELAEZ, a narcotics trafficker according to
source, who introduced her to PEREZ Jimenez. Since then Iden B
lived with PEREZ Jimenez for about a year, and every time PEREZ.
Jimenez visited her he gave her $100.00 for the "visit".
6. Iden B was also the mistress of Pedro* SUAREZ (mat. unk.),
former Councilman of Marianao municipal term, Havana province.
According to source, Pedro SUAREZ was Iden B's lover here in
Miami. One time Pedro SUAIZ took Iden B to see a "witch"
mulatto who lives in Miami, who is also Rolando MASFERRER's
"witch", according to source. Pedro SUAREZ wanted to control
Iden B through this "witch", but she came to an agreement with
the "witch" so that the "witch" would write a letter to BATISTA
to make him send a large sum of money to her. When Pedro SUAREZ
learned about this, he beat up the "witch" and denounced her
to the Cuban Refugee Center. According to source, Iden B has
another lover named "Chicho!" CARDENAS (mat. unk.), who is now
Public Works Minister in the Republic of Panama.
7. AMBIDDY/1 talked to Iden C and asked his help in

WAVE Comment: The Station is investigating these rumors
of an alleged love nest being built for Iden B. AMYUM/19 claims
that he is unaware of any validity to the rumor.
19. At present, Iden B lives with her two sons, AMBIDDY/1
and a maid named Iden G who is also a homosexual. This Iden G
has brothers in Cuba who are militiamen and she corresponds with
them. Iden G's husband is known as "El Gallego", and he is now
in the training camps. Iden G has been a friend of Iden B for
many years, and is the one who used to accompany her to her dates
with BATISTA. According to source, Iden G knows too much about
Iden B and is the one who really directs her.
20.
Source further reports that the current AMYUM Chief of
Intelligence, Iden H, is married to a woman named Iden I, who
practices prostitution. AMBIDDY/1 has ordered the Intelligence
Chief to collect information on Iden B, but all the reports he
submits on her are good because the AMYUM Intelligence Chief is
an unconditional supporter of Iden B. One time the AMYUM
Intelligence Chief hit an AMYUM member because he made unfavorable
comments about Iden B.
21. Source learned from Iden B that Juan AMADOR Rodriguez is
one of the newspapermen in exile who receive money from AMBIDDY/1.
Iden B also told source that the articles and declarations made
by Iden J are written by Iden K.
22. Source further reports she learned AMBIDDY/1 had difficulties
with the ERACORN brothers because Hugo ELIAS Martinez, stationed
in one of the encampments, brought contraband whiskey into
Nicaragua and this angered the ERACORN brothers. Source also
:
learned that an individual named Raul LEAL Garcia deserted from
the encampments together with 21 men. This Raul LEAL is now
living in marital relations with Martha BRAVO, a very close friend
of Iden D.
23. Source 2: Iden L
Both Iden B and her sister Iden D are homosexuals. Iden C
(works at the Eden Rock in Miami Beach and lives with a Miami Beach
gangster in addition to practicing prostitution. Iden M is an
accountant, is registered in the Association of Cuban Accountants
in Exile and works on Miami Beach.
84.
According to source, Iden B was Fulgencio BATISTA Zaldivar'
mistress and had a son by him. In order to avoid trouble in this
affair, BATISTA married her off to Iden C, a member of the
Constitutional Army with a terrible moral reputation,
Iden B used to "pose" with her sister to please her lover
BATISTA and her husband. Afterwards, Iden C continued to exploit
Ides B with this "posing".
When Iden B arrived in the U. 8., (source does not
remember date) she became the mistress of former Venezuelan
President Marcow PEREZ Jimenez, and later the mistress of Pedro
BUAREZ, & former Marianno Councilman. “SUAREZ „avo Iden B an

25. Source further reports that Iden B had homosexual
relations with Iden A (source #1). In turn, this Iden A also
has homosexual relations with a known homosexual named Iden G,
aka "Campeona", who lives with Iden B and AMBIDDY/1.
According to source, this group of "ladies" used to meet
with Olga*GUILLOT Vidal both in Cuba and here in Miami to hold
"parties". One of Iden B's friends is Aida PEREZ Pozo, aka "La
Gorda", who together with-Pat (aka "La Americana") are partners
of a man called "Chucho" who is in jail on charges of narcotics
trafficking in which he was recently surprised.
Source states that she is well acquainted with Iden B's
intimate affairs because she knew her in Cuba and lived in her
house here in Miami for one year.
26. Source 3: AMCRAG/1
On 17 May 1964, Francisco TABERNILLA Palmero talked to
AMWORM/1 and told him KUBARK was investigating the private lives
of AMBIDDY/1 and Iden B, because it seems it is feared AMBIDDY/1
is being infiltrated by "batistiano" elements.
The investigation that is being made of AMBIDDY/1 is quite
publicly known in Miami.

AKWORLD-- Review of Deficiencies
A meeting with AMBIDDY-1 has been called for weekend
of 27 June in order to review certain deficiencies in ANWORLD
management and, in this context, convey to AMBIDDY-1 expres-
sions of Chief, WH's serious concern over manifestations of
insufficient leadership in giving direction to and exercising
supervision over the AMWORLD effort and the personnel assigned
18.
In reviewing events of the preceding twelve months,
will be possible to balance praise and stricture. What
kappened, it appears, is that after a flying start, the
project in beginning to feel the effects of a devolution of
CIA controls and that deficiencies in the quality of AMBIDDY–1'
leadership now appear in more striking relief, m
In relating to AMBIDUY-1 our views regarding the
state of ANWORLD affairs, we propose to dwell on following
aspects:
=
Management Slippagen, carrying over into th
the
field of finances. Still no capable administrator. No
indications disbursament of funds subjected to centrele
other than requiring receipts. Doubts whether any kiné
of budgetting still being enforced aince we converted to
straight and fixed subsidising. Faint odor of corruption.
St.?. Suality of Personnel. Leadership bracket poorly
staffed. šince program's inception, recruitment drive

scandal potential of this relationship. Has proveR
impervious to low-key advice that scandal could ensue
and that its full exploitation by Castro would be
foregone conclusion.
4. Above inventory of major defects in ANWORLD. probably
incomplete and partly based on hearsay and derived from
patently prejudiced sources. Some manifestations of disarray
may merely be concomitant of organizational shakedown and
elimination of marginal personnel. Others may be presumed
endemic ills of most resistance organims left to own devices
plus Cuban propensity to fractionalize. In final analysis
as
we could probably justify the Agency input as long as AMBIDDY-1
produces an occasional Pilon. Reconstruction of viable resis-
tance movements inside Cuba, however, is remote prospect,
especially if we conclude that target area now virtually
denied to all but singleton, short-tern operators. Commando
raids may continue to prosper as long as we are permitted to
ve
render intel support on its present level.

above field grade level either at standstill or unavailing.
Why is it good people do not flock to ANWORLD's colors,
especially after Pilon? Among reasons most fréquently
mentioned, AMBIDOY-1's alleged unwillingness to delegate
authority and tendency to surround himself with dross of
exile community which repels good elements. Sierra and.
Cantillo, who above average; have already quit.
Political Action. Other than what taken in hand
by AMBIDDY-1 personally, media output of deplorably low
quality. AMBIDDY-1 himself goofed after Pilon.
Operational Planning. June performance below
par despite WAVE training and Jenkins' consultation.
last-minute choice of target in Pinar del Rio ill-conceived
Rio
and slipshod.
Operational Security. Virtually non-existent.
Twin-strike against Cabo Crus and Punta Maisi, originally
scheduled for June 1964, prematurely blown and Cubaa
reception committees presumably lying in wait. Prelim
inary survey indicates likelihood proposes operation
videly known in AMWORLD Miami cirales. Leakage, there-
fore, not necessarily attributable to high-level penetra
tion, but hypothesis such penetration exists is quite
supportable.
Remedy: Headquarters will couse discussing
operational plans inside U. B. and insist on passing
intel abroad.
HBIECY-1 has consistently ignored our advice
batten down hatches and prepare for major CIS
slaught, "especially post-Pilon. His so-called intel
stion staffed with camp-followers and headed by a the
Daly professional (Major Gomez) about to be ditched.
Morele situation. Poor, except maybe ámo
eat entres. Amtum-18 toying with idea to quit.
Others may follow suit. Charisma no substitute for
managerial ability. ANBIDDY-1's dissoluteness setting
peor example,
"Adelaida." Clear indications she henpeake him
and possibITIty that after one your of cohabitation he
trusts her unreservedly, withholding nothing. Either

AMWORLD MEETING IN NEW ORLEANS, 24 June 1964
SUBJECT:
Adlaida PADRON y Crus - Decision
29 June 1964
Nove Her to
Nicaragua
1. Drawing liberally upon data supplied in UPGA 16512,
we reminded AMBIDDY-1 about our misgivings regarding his
association with Adelaida PADRON y Cruz. He conceded aware-
ness of some of the rumors circulating about her past private
life and stated that he had satisfied himself that they were
founded. He injected that wo knew that Jose Mole Rosales
has been asked to do some investigating and had given Adelaida
Padron a clean bill of health. We also happened to know that
KOLE was aware of the true story and for reasons of his own
ad decided to withhold it from AMBIDDY-1. We inquired what
knew about Senora HOLE and he commented that she had bee
"bad woman" We observed that the "had beam" was open to
question.
2. ANBIDDY-1 averred that he had listened to a telephone
conversation beton Adelaida and her former husband, Reger
Bejas Lavernis, in which the latter had admitted that the str
about his having acted under higher orders when marrying
Adelaida were unfarmded. AHBIDDY-1 also charged the ex-husband
of having tried to matice his wife to participate in orgies,
but that Adelaida had refused to
3. As regards Adelaida's alleged illicit relationship
•President BATISTA, AMBIDDY-1 simply declared the charge
founded. Adelaida did know Carlos CANTILLO Gonzales
was m old fried of the family. She also had met ex-Presi-
JINEEEZ, but nothing of spromising nácare ha
had ensued.
. When asked whether it was trus that laida had intro-
dused him to several prominent Venezumians, he denied this and
stated that intredestions had been made by Silvia GARCIA,
trusted childised friend of ANBIDDY–1.

of logistics in Costa Rica, was accused of embezzling

The following is a letter from AMBIDDY-1's father
to his son.
8 June 1964
My dear son Manolin,
It has been a while since we have received a letter
from you.
We are writing this to find out how you are
and we suppose you are well. Here everyone is well,.
thank God.
Your mother is not writing you because I am writing
it quickly so that it can leave today.
We have presented everything since 20 March as well
as depositing the price of the fares and we are only
waiting for permission to leave which we will soon have.
When it happens we will send you a cable.
Your Godmother Rosa is sick and when I saw her today
she told me she hoped you would come to liberate her.
Therefore we know you are doing your duty. I support your
position. Don Jaime is well, thank God.

I saw Emilita and she sends her love. She also told
me to tell you to write Lino and his brother a letter
and to send it via this channel. Emilita is not going
there until you send (the letter) and it should be
ba
done through this channel if it is possible.
That letter which is addressed to Conseulc du la
Campa de B. put a stamp on it immediately and mail it
so it arrives at its destination. I am staying in her
father's home and I am very anxious to help her.

5. Our query why Adelaida, if she had AMBIDDY-1's
interests at heart, appeared to have qualms about owning up
in respect to past events, was parried by AMBIDUY-1 by claiming
that Adelaida was of course aware of all these rumors and had
warned his of possible political embarrassment.
6. Evaluating UFGA 16512 on the basis of our talk with
AMBIDUY-1, we conclude that its main source has a high batting
average. At least there appears to be a hard core of truth to
practically all allegations made, to the extent wa ware able
to check them out. We would venture the guess that, despite
his protestations to the contrary, AMBIDDY-1 is quite conversant
with Adelaida's past history, but can see no practical gain in
so telling us. He may reason that an avowal of intent to marry
woman whose antecedents are in fact as described, would seriously
blemish his image and that by pleading ignoranca now he can, if
things should get out of control, always strike a pose of injured
innocence and elicit a "here but for the Grace of God go 1" re-
I"
action from his PAPRIME associates.
7. Agreement that all interested parties would benefit by
Roving Adelaida's abode from the WAVE area to Nicaragua was
reached on the basis of AMBIDDY-1's acceptance of our flat state-
ment that wea view Adelaida as a potential hazard to AMWORLD's and
KUBARK's security. He based this reasoning upon numerous indi-
cations that Adelaida had become all but completely privy to
everything that was going on in AMWORLD and that her discretion
left a great deal to be desired. We drew no denial from AMBIDDY-1
when stating that Adelaida had become witting of the WAVE training
course for AMBIDDY-1 and that she presumably knew about KIBARKA
support for AHWORLD. We referred to Adelaida's lesbian associates,
without stating that we suspected her of holding charter membership
in that severity. He mentioned by nams Aida FEREZ and Lucia CABO.
When the latter was labelled by us a lesbian believed to be in
Adelaide's sompluta emfidence, AMBIDDY-1 evinced surprise mid
for reasons difficult to fathom almost dismay. We concluded
stressing the importance of breaking up Adelaide's circle of
associates and confidents as an indispensable prerequisite for
containing the threat her access to information we considera
classified represents and asked AMBIDNT-1 te make sure that
member of this group would follow her to Hisaragua.

1. AMBIDDY/1 himself raised this matter with
while neither James nor Ferrer were within earshot.
Quoting ANYUM/19, he inquired whether marriage with
Subject would be one of the causes for KUBARK to
terminate the existing AMWORLD relationship. I
emphatically answered in the negativa, going over by
now well-trodden ground once more and, hopefully,
making myself understood.
8. In summary, I stated we held no views one way
or the other about his intent to contract marriage.
Our concern was strictly political since we could
visualize a number of unpleasant consequences flowing.
from the event. True or false, certain allegations
had been made about Subject's past and there were
goodly number of people prepared to testify to the
accuracy of those allegations, among them (I presumed)
Subject's ex-husband. The political implications of
the proposed union could not possibly escape him,
especially if ANTHUG should get hold of it.
AMBIDOY/1 opined that he had lived in open
sin with Subject for over a year. This was what was
bothering him and evidently some of his closest
associates, not Subject's alleged past. He needed
this relationship with Subject to maintain (literal
quote) his emotional balance. He was working under
considerable strain and the rare moments with Subject
alone were his sole relaxation. The issue of sin was
deeply disturbing to him, and marriage, he felt, would
resolve this situation of conflict. In order to avoid
certain political repercussions, he was now giving
thought to taking Subject with him to Nicaragua: and
contract a "secret" marriage.

ANWORLD Meeting in Juan, 7-8 June 1964
SUBJECT: AMBIDDY/1's Political Reporting
1. I reminded Subject that in the past we had
frequently pressed him to keep us abreast of his
political activities with particular emphasis upon
relations with the host governments in Central America.
The response to our urgings had been increasingly
disappointing and of late reached the vanishing point.
Since it was not curiosity that had prompted us to ask
for timely reporting but a desire to be of service in
protecting the rear, we were now wondering whether
it would not be best to leave the determination whether
or not to submit political reports to him rather than
continue importuning him which was beginning to place
us in a slightly ridiculous position. AMBIDDY/1
pleaded over-work in excuse of his failure to provide
timely reporting and we resisted the temptation to
point to other more likely causes of mental and physical
fatigue.
8. As of now we believe to have reached a clear
understanding with AMBIDDY/1 that as always ve stand.

THE TROOPS THAT WILL OVERTHROW CASTRO ARE ALREADY IN CUBA
THEY ARE THE PEOPLE WHO CHEARED HIM.
WHEN THEY BELIEVED HIM A HERO OF
OUR LIBERTIES
Following is a translation of an interview of Manuel Artine
by Agustin Camargo, as reported in the Spanish language maga-
zine Bohemia Internacional, Caracas, Venezuela, 7 June 1964.7
8. - Your group has initiated a new offensive against the Castro
regime during the last few days in cooperation with one carried
out by other revolutionary units. Do you expect victory soon?
Everyone knows when wars begin, but never when they end.
I would like to say that it will be soon, but my duty as
a leader is to prepare the people of Cuba and the Cubans in exile
for the kind of war we expect: a long, hard war, but one that
we shall win if all Cubans pull together in accordance with their
ability.
There may be imponderable factors, "surprises" which
could bring about the fall of the tyrant; but we must never
count on "miraculous" solutions, on invasions that do not exist
or on organizations that will pull our chestnuts out of the fire.
-
Are you considering the possibility of eventually uniting
your men and resources with those of the Cuban Revolutionary
Junta or the Alpha 66
-
II Front
-O
MRP or any other unit that
may be currently carrying on the struggle inside Cuba?
- The frontiers of our movement have never been closed to
anyone who wants to fight for Cuba, with the exception of totali-
tarian movements either of the right or of the left.
What we do think wise to explain is that we do not be-
lieve in political action units in exile. We believe only in

We made no attempt, which in any case would have been
vain, to break up the relationship between AMBIDDY-1 and
Adelaida. We apologized to him for involving ourselves in
matters of a private and intimate nature which unfortunately
were beginning to impinge upon ODYOKE security interests.
AMBIDOT-1 in turn made it clear that he thinks he is in love
and that separation is not in the cards. We dropped the
issue by assuring AMBIDDY-1 that the day would come when things
could be seen in better perspective and that he could depend on
not to gloat of remind him that we had told him so.
We mentimed offhand that we assumed that Adelaida
had all the papers necessary to affect her departure from
PEPRIME. AMBIDDY-1 replied that she had not been able yet to
get the necessary papers. We simply commented that she should
ask for then.

-
You personally and the M.R.R. in general have always been
cited as "favorites" of certain North American groups or go-
vernmental agencies. Is that correct?
A. - I would like to have those who speak of this favoritism
answer me this question:
Do they call the Bay of Pigs episode favoritism?
Do they call the two years I spent in jail waiting to
put my back to the wall and be shot favoritism?
Do they call the state of abandonment in which the clan-
destine M.R.R. was left in Cuba after the battle of Giron Beach
favoritism?
Do they call favoritism the fact that on my leaving jail
I had to break with the Revolutionary Committee because it had
been converted into an instrument for not carrying the war to
Cuba?
Do they call favoritism the fact that we have had to
leave American territory to be able to continue the struggle
against Castro?
Do they call favoritism the fact that we have to fight
long war because we get no help from those who could make it
short?
But these campaigns of "favoritism" do not surprise me.

I know that International Con unism cannot admit publicly that
it is being defeated by the people of little Cuba who are only
getting help from their brothers in Latin America, from: God
and from their indomitable desire to be Free.
->
Q. Today you talk of bringing about uprisings in the forces
of the Castro regime, and you seem to trust in this as the best
way to liberate the island from Soviet and Communist domination.
Why didn't you take that position three years ago, since it was
Just as valid then as now?
A.
Three years ago we took the same position as today. Just
remember that the M.R.R. was the first revolutionary organiza-
tion to rise up against the tyrant Castro to try to overthrow
him by internal action at a time when many were convinced that
Fidel was a Communist but said "that it was not yet time to say
o to the people".
Remember that the first weapons for internal rebellion
were carried to Cuba by the M.R.R.
Remember that Francisco, the M.R.R. Coordinator in Cuba
was not only the cheerful organizer of the resistance but also
eventually the national coordinator of the whole clandestine
movement.
Remember that the Bay of Pigs invasion was designed to
be only the gold buckle to fasten up the stage of active re-
sistance and guerrilla activities.
Remember the long list of over 150 martyrs of the clan-
destine war of the M.R.R. which shown clearly the priority we

they respect the dignity of man.
This is not the first time we say publicly that this
war of liberation of our enslaved Cuba must be carried on
"no matter whom it pleases, no matter whom it displeases",
since it is true that powerful nations have international
obligations to carry out and it is also true that we Cubans
have our inescapable duties to our enslaved country.
Q.
-
--
If arned action within Cuba guerrilla war in the
mountains and war of terror in the cities should, as ex-
pested produce a wave of popular uprisings both among students
and workers and in the military units of the dictatorship,
do you think that the democratic nations of the hemisphere
would come to our help? Aren't you afraid of a repetition
of what happened in Budapest?
A. - Although I am convinced that at some definite moment
they would come to our help, we cannot base our war on col-
lective assistance. We must plan our strategy as a purely
Cuban struggle from beginning to end.
Many Latin American nations have already helped us
-in accordance with their ability and thanks to them we can
do what we are doing.
As for the rear of a repetition of what happened in
Budapest taking place in Cuba, we cannot forget that Cuba
has no frontier with Russia.

never had blind confidence in anything human, because everything
that is done blindly is done badly, it is true that I had con-
fidence in North American material help. Reason: because we
were seeing it. (I do not think it was a secret to anyone where
the weapons we used in the invasion came from.) I had no scru-
ples in accepting American weapons to offset those from Russia
which Fidel Castro was receiving in gigantic shipments.
After leaving prison I lost coníidence in that assistance
because since then not only have I seen none, but also I have
not seen the possibility even of getting any.
Not only has my interest switched toward Latin America,
but also my gratitude toward these people who have opened their
arms to offer us help when all doors were being closed against
us. Thanks to them we can continue the struggle.

.
What opinion do you think the conduct of nations like Eng-
land and France deserve, who, turning their backs on principles
they claim to hold and on moral and humane considerations, take
part in propping up Castro's bloody regime by supplying him
with credits and all kinds of financial backing?
A. - First I do not want to confuse countries with governments.
Most peoplems are innocent of the atrocities and treacheries of
their governments.
That kind of behavior never surprised me in the case of
the English government, as they did something even worse in
Korea where their soldiers were dyingunder attacks from waves

assigned at that time to rebellion in the local forces.
Remember that before the misc camps were set up
there were infiltration camps provided especially to assist
this internal rebellion.
8. - Some international circles claim that Russia is abandon-
ing Castro, that it has agreed on this abandonment secretly
with North America, and that this is visibly evident in the
gradual withdrawal of Soviet troops from the island. They add
that confidence in this agreement has caused North America to
"tolerate" this fresh outbreak of armed activities in the Car-
ibbean. Do you share this view?
Frankly I do not believe in international pacts that are
not clear to me, and I believe much less in the willingness of
Russia to carry out its agreements: Poland, Chechoslovakia
and Hungary are historical witnesser of Russian treachery.
As for "tolerating our activities", I cannot speak,
because we have not asked for "tolerance" for them. It never
cccurred to me to "ask permission" to die for my country...
Would you subordinate the possibilities of liberation
of your country to any advantage of an international nature
for the United States?
My country's interests are greater than those of any other
nation. Any Ouban who does not believe that does not deserve
to be called a Juban.
I do not believe the United States expects such a shook-
ing attitude from the Gubans. They may have many faults but

of Chinese from red Manchuria while the goverment was selling
steel to Felin.
In the case of the French government I was sorrowful be-
cause of the figure of Gen. DeGaulle. As a young Cuban I used
to hold in my heart the image of DeGaulle, hero of the Second
World War, leader of his country's resistance in the fight
against the foreign invader.
It was hard for me to realize that this same man would
turn his back on the principles which made him beloved by the
free world. It is unfortunate that such a brilliant career
should have been darkened at its ending.
In any case, some day Cuba will be free and those govern-
ments can be sure that, if they do not alter their conduct, they
will then receive their payment in the same historical currency
that they have passed out to our martyred people.
You and your party have been accused of being fascists, of
being a bee-hive for the Central Intelligence Agency and a
"cover" for the worst political and economic interests of our
country. What do you have to say about that?
A. Nothing. Let my actions and my history answer the ques-
tion. Those who are going to go on saying this are the Com-
munists and the foolish tools of communism.

was the only organization at this stage of the Cuban struggle

contains our complete ideology, and the same thing is contained
in the political testament that I wrote before leaving for the
Bay of Pigs, as it also appears in my book Marchas de Guerra y
Cantos de Presidio (War Marches and Prison Songs), written while
I awaited death, as is clearly explained in the recent pamphlet
about my full statement to the members of the A.R.E.C.
If wishing to carry to Cuba a state of independence, li-
berty, justice, respect for the dignity of human beings; if
wishing to have the constitution of 1940 effective as long as
it is not revoked by the same people who approved it; if oppos-
ing all demagogic extremes and all totalitarian impositions;
if all this is being a fascist; then I am a fascist.
But since fascism is totalitarianism established by an
oligarchy in the name of supposed racial purity, I cannot be a
fascist.
As for the other accusations of obeying or being a cover
for unsavory interests, I challenge anyone to give me the name
of a single individual among our revolutionary directors who
has a blemish in this respect; I challenge anyone to analyze
the statistios of our martyrs; I challenge anyone to analyze
our history.

the situation on the island and treat with Castro as if they
believed that all hope of liberation had expired. Can you tell
us something about the internal struggle against comunism?
A.
->
To think that all hope of liberation has expired in Cuba
is to show a complete lack of knowledge of the condition and
character of the Cuban people. The history of Cuba is a his-
tory of repeated martyrdom in search of real liberty.
I can say very little about the internal struggle that
does not affect its security. But let it be sufficient to say
that today there are guerrillas in five of the six provinces
of Cuba; that the tyrant knows about them and that he has not
been able to wipe them out because of the peasants' support
for them; that in the cities the sentiment of the workers has
begun to be mobilized toward passive resistance, and that
within the very ranks of the militia Cuban patriots are form-
ing independent cells.
From the days of the Bay of Pigs you seemed to trust blind-
by in North American material backing for your struggle. But
lately we see you shifting your interest toward Latin American
countries.
Why?
Actually my first glance was toward Latin America. I took
residence in Mexico where I published my book Traición (Treach-
ery) and I traveled around Latin America Carrying the shout of
alarm against communism. Afterward I went to North America in
constant search of resources for the war, and although I have

A.
-
Yes. We dream of independence with liberty, liberty with
culture, culture with bread, bread for honest work, honest work
with respect for the dignity of the human being; and all this
in a democratic regime of Latin American character and Chris-
tian morality.
8.
-
Would your group favor keeping some laws of the Revolution
if it is proved that they correspond to some need, or do you
think that the Fidel epoch should be swept out completely and
a fresh start made?
2424 -
A. When Fidel's regime is overthrown, Cuban needs are going
to be quite different from those of our country with the tyrant
in power. I believe the laws he made which could answer real
Cuban needs were badly conceived and directed even worse.
I believe that without fundamentally changing the 1940
constitution, which means for Cuba a return to the rule of law,
it will be possible to make laws which will meet Cuban needs.
Are you opposed to the negroes?
No; nor am I opposed to the whites, which means the same
thing to me. What interests us is not the color of the skin.
but the color of the soul and of the ideals.
Perhaps that is why our movement is the one that has
more black brothers in its ranks, including the highest civil
and military positions.
of
Do you favor, as has been stated, establishment in Cuba
semi-confessional state with open predominance of the
most conservative elements of the Catholic Church?

Neither of the most conservative nor of the most liberal;
that would be "clericalism" and it is expressly condemned in
Papal Encyclicals.
I personally am a Catholic and will never deny my faith,
because I have no vocation to be an apostate.
But of course, the movement is full of men of all rali-
gions and oreeds.
Certainly we shall reaffirm with the 1940 constitution
our belief in God and the necessity for Christian morality.
We believe that every child has the right to receive
preparation in whatever religion he chooses.

What will the M.R.R. do with the Rebel Army and the Hi-
liția once Cuba is liberated?
Those who turn around and fight against the tyrant will
be retained in the armed forces with the same rank as before.
Those who do not will be discharged and returned to private
life if they have committed no crime, but if they have, they
will have to answer to the civil courts in normal fashion,
which will again function in Cuba in accordance with the 1940
constitution.
The only ones who have anything to fear are foreign
Communists and members of repressive agencies.

regarding the house in the WAVE area which AMBIDDY-1 intends to
purchase in the name of Nilo Messer.
3. If it should turn out that the conditions described in
Ref report are not drastically remedied and continue to pose a
festering threat to the security of AMWORLD, your station may have
to be requested to investigate. In the meanwhile, we are hopeful
that subject's removal from the WAVE area will serve to attenuate
this bad situation.
Thanks to Mef A report, we were able (without going into
too much sordid detail) to put AMBIDDY-1 on notice that we view his
association with Subject in the WAVR area as a potential threat to
AMWORLD's and EUBARK's security and that the political scandal.
potential of the existing situation is equally formidable. We
consequently fell in with AMBIDDY-1's suggestion, made during the
latest meeting in Panama City, that he wave the center of his illicit
affair to Manngua where it would be easier to contain unpleasant
repercussions than in the WAVE area. We urged AMBIDDY-1, and he
promised to hood our advice, that ne dot permit subject to take
along to Hicaragua nembers of her present entourage, singling out
Identity O of Ref A as a particular case in point.
It should be stressed that ANBIDDY-1 is unwavering in hi
(real or feigned) conviction that Subject is pure as driven snow and
badly maligned and that he has a ready explanation for every "rumor.
It would have been unwise to attempt coercing him into discontinuing
his affair with Subject and most likely he would not have yielded to
any pressures. Hence, we had no choice but to settle for the pro-
posed move to Nicaragua which represents a palliative at best.

nals and return to the rule of law.
Do you believe Cuban national interests when freed from
communism will be better served if the nation is placed in a
position of international neutrality?
A. We shall always be an aggressive forefront of the West
against comunism. We can never be neutral in a struggle in
which the destiny of civilization is at stake.
-
Engineer Ray and you seem to be performing parallel acți-
vities as you approach almost five years of struggle against
Castro and are apparently the two most important political
figures of our future. Could you tell us what keeps you apart?
A. -
Starting from the assumption that we are fighting for a
democracy, any ideological difference between another group of
Cubans and ourselves will be resolved in the future by the Cuban.
people in free elections. I do not think this is the historic
moment to talk about differences. If the regime set up in Cuba.
after Fidel Castro is defeated is a totalitarianism or a dieta-
torship of left or right, we shall KEEP ON USING OUR GUNS.
Why don't you take the command of Brigade 2506 and why has
it not been possible to consolidate around the brigade all the
exile elements since it is the largest group of veterans of our
war?
1..
A great many of our brothers of Brigade 2506 are already
in our ranks. The brigade could not consolidate exiles around
it because it was formed to be a military unit without politi-
eal plans; recently arrived from Communist prisons, it went to
North American army camps to continue its training. That is

good or ill have left a political philosophy to history.
A
leader has a duty to understand them completely. But the ide-
oligies that are most familiar to ne are moulded in the unfor-
gettable thoughts of Jesus Christ, Martí and Bolívar.
This is the first time I hear myself called an "An-
tillean version" of Primo de Rivera. If anyone says so, it
must be in secret because I have never heard it. What I was
called once was a "fascist" when I was in prison awaiting the
death penalty; it was the traitor Fidel Castro in person.
It is possible that he has friends in exile.
Q.
What do you consider the weakest of the Castro regime?
A. - The people, the people of Cuba, who would rather die on
their feet than live on their knees; the people who now real-
ize the total surrender to a foreign power and have seen the
complete failure of Communist doctrine. The troops that
will overthrow Fidel Castro are already in Cuba, the very peo-
ple who cheered him when they thought him the hero of our li-
berty.
The presence of Russian occupation troops in Cuba has
definitely revitalized the nationalist spirit of our country.
What will you do in case you come to govern Cuba, with
private schools, with the press and with private initiative of
an economic nature?
In the first place, our fight is not for the purpose of
putting me in the government; it is to make our country inde-
pendent. But if you ask me what is my idea about what a govern-

why I left its ranks. I did not want enyone to say that I was
trying to orient the brigade politically by trying to unite
the exiles around it. Besides I thought that I was more useful
to my country in trying to carry the war into Cuba than in re-
ceiving a training that I did not know whether I would put da
in practice some day. Time has proved I was right.
-
Q. What would you do, or what are you doing with the follow-
ers of Batista? Do you think this way of naming some people
who form closed bloos with persons of very dissimilar history
and interests, is real and does any good for Cuba?
- For me there are no Batistianos nor Priistas nor any other
discriminative "ista". I only believe in a moral classifica-
tion of men, and there are good ones and bad ones in all the
governments our country has had. The only salvation for Cuba
is to bring together all worthy and honest Cubans of all epochs,
of all social classes, of all colors, and of all ages, into a
new historical generation to consolidate our nation after the
traitor's regime has been overthrown. Poor Cuba if we continue
to harbor sectarian hates and sterile discriminations!
It is said that you are an admirer of Jose Antonio Primo
de Rivera, that you are familiar with his ideology, and that
his assistants say in private that you are an Antillean version
of him. Is this true?
It is a fact that I am familiar with Primo Rivera's ide-
ology, as I am also familiar with that of Mahatma Ghandi, Rous-
seau, Roosevelt, Lenin, Hitler and all the men who for mankind's

ment ought to do in Cuba in respect to these matters, my answer
is: Regarding private education: protect it in every possible.
way, and raise public education to the same level as private.
Regarding the press: liberty of the press and assistance for
the school for reporters to make Cuban newspaper men more ef-
ficient. The Cuban press will educate our peoples' background
so as to definitively wash the wounds which communism has in-
flisted on the spirit of our children and young people.
1
Regarding private enterprise: protection for it, assis-
tance for small business, and by means of modern tax laws make
sure that business performs its social function. The United
States, Western Germany and many other countries can give us
an exact idea of what we want.
What is your final message to your exiled people in this
grave moment of history?
That we cannot and must not trust in international solu-
tions nor in easy paths to our country's independence. That
we must return to the romantic spirit of our war of independence,
to that difficult, self-sacrificing, hard war of a Martí 001-
leeting pennies and a Maceo spending them on bullets; to that
war of Cubáns within and Oubans without against those who are
no longer Oubans.
If every Cuban offers what he can; if we obtain, as was
done in 1895, the fraternal embrace of our brother peoples; if
we put the interests of a country that must be saved before our
personal interests, Ouba will be independent. Because this bat-

A CONTROVERSIAL FERSONALITY
It can be said of the Secretary General of the Movement
for Revolutionary Recovery, Manuel Artine, that there is much
to say, but never that he has lacked spirit to fight for the
liberty of Cuba.
.+
Combative and polemical, Artime today occupies a singu-
lar position in the fight against Castro in which he collects
furious insults and almost fanatical proselytiem in equal quan-
tities. Hir early struggle against Batista's dictatorship and
his activity in Sierra Maestra in Column One commanded by Fidel
Castro, made him an outstanding figure in the Revolution. His
break with Castro and his denunciation of the olive green trea-
ohery to the great romance of the Cuban people made him the
target for all attacks and insults. In the spring of 1960 Ar-
time went into exile. In Mexico he wrote a book denouncing
Castro's apostasy. With other eminent democratio leaders he
helped icund the Revolutionary Front (later Committee) and ex-
erted intense propaganda and political activity throughout the
continent which culminated in the disastrous Bay of Pigs inva-
sion. This was one of the most critical points in Manuel Ar-
time's civic career. His activity in it -- personally heroic
though it was - helped throw on him the shadow of new attacks
and suspicions. But it also converted him into a leader of the
first rank which the maturity of a prison term and his sonspi-
ratorial and revolutionary activities afterward only enhanced.

Manuel Artime has become today, by virtue of the attack
of his troops on Puerto Pilon, the principal figure of current
Cuban activity. His group has been hammered into one of the
most disciplined, one of the largest and most efficient in the
Con-
heroic struggle of the people of Cuba for their liberty.
sequently everything he does and says is of passionate interest
for this people in exile, a people which wants to know closely
and they should the thoughts and activities of the men
--
who will probably lead them in the future.
This is why Manuel Artime is brought to these Cuban
pages of BOHEMIA, which have been, are now and will continue
to be the ideal civic rostrum for the people of Cuba.
Artime has the floor.

Boysen or Mr. James.
2. Latest report indicates that the ADELAIDA will
arrive at Monkey Point at 0400 4 June. A-1 has obtained
his re-entry visa. A-1 was again asked to give us the
tapes on his Venezuelan conference. A-1 promised to have
them done today.
3. A-1 was asked to please make sure that someone
sees Mr. Barnes concerning the petroleum arrangements.
It was mentioned to A-1 that Mr. Barnes has been waiting
for over a week to see someone in A-l's organization.
Mr. Barnes has been kind enough to offer his services
and we feel it is unfair to keep this gentleman waiting.
All plans to send Sixto Mesa and Mr. King today. A-1
will notify us of what transpired at the meeting.

1.
AMBIDDY-1 called the office again tossay that he
would be meeting Al Burt at 1600. A-1 inquired if it would
do any harm in seeing Mr. Summ of the State Department since
the latter mentioned to AMJAVA-4 that he had not seen A-1
in over a year. A-1 felt that a courtesy visit was called
for. We advised A-1 that we could see no harm in visiting
him.
A-1 reported that one of his pilots, Ginebra, had
reived an offer to fly planes in the Congo. A-1 did not
know if Ginebra would accept the offer.
3. We told A-1 that we had received a report that in
finca in Nicaragua called Marianita he had met several U. 8.
Air Force officers and asked if there were any truth to the
report. A-1 stated that one of their houses is located in
Marianita but he had not met any U. S. officers there.
4. A-1 gleefully reported he contemplates making
quite a lot of changes in Miami. A-1 did not elaborate
but it appears that most of the propaganda section will be
leaving Miami.
5. A-1 was requested to ‘obtain
the DOLORES by 1 June.

6. We asked A-1 if he had any ideas of where AMBANG-1
is at present. A-1 is of the opinion that AMBANG-1 is
probably hiding in some small island off Puerto Rico.
7. A-1 inquired if he could sue the Newsweek magazine.
We advised him that he could sue but the likelihood of him
winning the case was slight. A-1 was referring to the
article which stated he intended to draw the United States

any truth to the matter. A-1 laughed and said, "Of course
not."
8. A-1 was advised that we consider 7 June a firm
date for the Consejo meeting. The reason we are piuning
him down to a specific date was because of the necessary
preparations that have to be made prior to any meeting.
A-1 said he would be there on that date.

1. AMBIDDY-1 stated that AMJAVA-4 will be meeting
with Carl in Houston this afternoon.
2. A-1 wants to meet with the Consejo on 7 June at
0830 in Panama City.
'
3. A-1 again reminded we would like to have the tapes
on what transpired in Venezuela. Martin reiterated that
in order to protect his interest we must have current.
intelligence concerning his organization.
.
4. It is the opinion of the Consejo that a frank,
off-the-record talk with Al Burt of the Miami press would
do no harm. We consider Burt to be a responsible newspaper-
man and he may be in a position to help A-1 put the
Pilon raid in its proper perspective. If A-1 thinks
this is a good idea he should speak openly to Burt about
the Pilon raid omitting the embroidery that has accompanied
his recent press statements. A-1 was reminded this inter-
view, if given, snould not mention or allude to KUBARK
support. Since Burt is an ambitious journalist he may
probably ask A-1 for a scop on his next raid; again we see
no harm in this. A-1 said he would ask Burt if he wanted
to go on a future raid. We mentioned that we doubted he
would accept the offer.
6. According to A-I, AMYUM-19 is still in New York
and is expected in Miami shortly.

AMBIDDY-1 expects to get his residency permit
today from Immigration in Miami.
.
2. Concerning A-l's request that we choose frequencies
for the 511 radios it was our opinion this task could be
done by Felix Rodriguez. In the special commo training
given to Felix, a course was specially geared to choosing
the correct frequencies and the proper crystals. A-1
mentioned the original request had sterwed from Felix.
A-1 was informed that the reports we have gotten about
Felix reflect that he likes to give the tedious jobs to
someone else and this is the case here.
3. A-1 and AMJAVA-4 will be leaving for Nicaragua
5 June.
'
A-1 asked if the Consejo meeting could be post-
poned until 9 June. A-1 was reminded when we originally
asked him to pick a day for the meeting we considered it
definite commitment. A-1 ecquiosed and said he would
