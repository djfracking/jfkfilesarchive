Mr. Lally
Amendment of CA for Antonio DOUBLETTE
(201–312729)
Form 124 dated 22 November 1966
1. In accordance with Reference, Subject was granted
an OA on 22 November 1966 to permit the WH/7/Haiti Desk to
utilize Subject as a Creole translator of unclassified tapes,
Subject was recruited in December 1966 and has been per-
forming this function satisfactorily since that time.
2. It is now requested that Subject's OA be amended
to permit WH/7/Haiti Desk to utilize his services to trans-
late sensitive telephone tapes (LIFEAT) from the Spanish,
French and Creole languages into English. To date the
Mexico City Station has been providing Headquarters with
a translation of the Spanish and French portions of this
intelligence take, with Port-au-Prince Station assisting
with translation of the Creole portions. Recently, however,
the Port-au-Prince asset departed Haiti and, at present,
neither Station has the capability to translate the Creole
portions. Since it is believed that the Creole portion may
contain important operational information from a CI stand-
point, the Haiti Desk proposes to utilize Subject to fulfill
this gap. Subject will be polygraphed before he is given
'this added task. Your expeditious attention to the above
request would be appreciated.

The salaries listed for LIFEUD in the project renewal
request do not jibe in most cases with the memoranda of
oral commitment which we have on file, and in some instances
(LIFEUDs 7, 8 and 9) the salaries are almost doubled. Would
you please verify for us that the salaries as submitted
in the renewal are those being paid, and if this is the
case, would you also prepare revised MO6s and send us
copies.

reference C included an armund arount of $500.00 each for the use or
LIBHI-Q, LIITUD-8, and LIBHUTH-24 PCV's; $400.00 each for the use of LIFTUD-S
and LITTLE-7 PCV's; and $300.00 per year for mileage reimburscrent to Carol
K. HINSISTUP. These arents have been paid these arounts over the years in
accordance with project approvals, However, in dew of the P-15-35 and
M-33-5 resulation revision in turunt 1964, which established the requirerent
for a TVA slot for PCV's used on a continuiry Mais, the question of the
need for a TVA is raised to preclude a possible audit exception.
3. The POV's are used by the amenta in transporting tires and othe
materiel between various operational mints. Mily use averares fhm 20
to 50 miles per day and from 1 to 4 hours per day dependine uron the assigment.
Use of pooled vehicles is not possible because of the widely semratel
points of contact, the need for situltaneous use and the irrecticability of
coontinsting the use of pooled vehicles fror a cover standpoint. Public
transportation is not practical amin because of the widely separated points
of contact and coverment transportation cannot be used because of cover.

Headquarters records indicate that Project LENOC was for
Linated 30 Jane 1965 as reported by reference B. WILSTED and MV-2539
were both transferred to Project LIFEAT. An ended TVA was for-
warded to the Station by TN #0561324, dated 9 July 1965...
2. The establishment of a transportation allowance is predicated
on a reduction in the number of Organization vehicles and a Savings
to ODTOKE. Considering vehicle depreciation over a period of several
yours and charges for gas, oil and maintenance, it is deemse economical
for eyes to pay the transportation allowance of $50.00 per month.
The availability of a POV, Which is intended primarily for personal
transportation and used only incidentally for official use, makes it
advantageous for the employee to receive a transportation allowance.
3. In the case at hand it is noted that 90% usage of a vehicle
by WILSTED, representing 1500 miles per month and a proposed $80.00
per month transportation allowance, is for official business. Sanco
the vehicle is used almost exclusively and very extensively for official
use, it scors or appropriate, as well as to the advantage of ODYONE
and WILSTED, that it should on an official vehicle.
4. Headquarters appreciates Station desire to reduce the number
of QP vehicles. However, each case must be decided on the basis of the
circumstances involved and, particularly, OLYOKE interest, he request
that the Station reconsider this case before wo submit it to higher
authority for approval.

Completion of Training Report on
David M. WILSTED
1. In a Mexico City Station Safesite, Subject received training
on a part time basis from 17 through 27 May 1967. The instructor was
Andrew S. PARMERS (known to trainee as Pablo Z5LAYA) from KUROAR,
Headquarters. Subjecta covered were clandestine communications,
operational security, Soviet Bloc intelligence activities, and
operational reporting.
2. As a student, Subject was cooperative, participated with
enthusiasm, and performed all requirements well. Although he has
had very little previous formal training, he has had much practical
experience and assimilates theory rapidly.
3. As a person, Subject is mature, calm, friendly, has a sense
of humor, practical, a doer rather than a thinker, aggressive, and
confident. He has broad area knowledge, is satisfied with his cover
employment and with his KUBARK employment. He had no complaints and
showed good emotional stability. He likes Mexico and Mexicans, and
speaks excellent Spanish.¨
4. He has a very limited knowledge of KUBARK functions and
organization, but he considers himself to be a careerist in this
organization.

1. Station Mexico City appreciates Headquarters forwarding of the dial
recorder pressure tape for project LIFEAT. While trying to expend the regular
tape on hand, Station had experimented with the new fiber-tipped pen as a
substitute for the standard ball point pen in the dial recorder. However,
either the altitude or the dry climate (or a combination of both)dried out
the fiber-tipped pen after short periods of use.
2. Station believes that the pressure tapes will provide a satisfactory
solution to this problem which has plagued the Project for some time.

Thomas C. LUND reported on returning to Headquarters
after his TOY in Mexico that one of the LIFEAT basehouse
keepers, possibly LIFEUD-1, was having difficulty in getting
the pens for the dial recorders to write. Therefore, Head-

100 reels of pressure tape for the LIFEAT basehouses to use
with the dial recorders. Headquarters hopes that this will
be a satisfactory solution to your problem, and if not,

process in use. If there is anything to the UNIBATH developer, its use in
our outside darkroom would be a decidedly worthwhile investment. lnquiries

1. Headquarters approves the suggestions made in reference for adapting
the ZONAR format to LIMAVOY needs. The Station will use the first two columns
for numbers running from 01 to 30 to designate the recording machine on which
the material was received, and the 6 spaces in column three will be used for
the dossier number assigned the target. Under this system, the Station has
room for expansion up to 999,999 tanets. The name IN, namo OUT, and telephone
number columns will be the samo for LIZNVOI ac for the system applied to
LIFEAT/ZONAR_abstracts.
2. Headquarters has several questions on the remaining columns.
a.
First of all, will the Station have the ZONAR abstract
sheets filled out in Spanish or English? If the runs appear in
English, they will be of limited value to the "exicans; if they
appear in Spanish, the Spanish and English abbreviations for the
same Subjects will not fall together in alphabetical consolidated
runs for the subject type runs. (See paragraph 3. below.)
b. According to paragraph 3 and 6 of reference the Station
wants the following III SONAR listings every timɔ months:
LIENVOY: 1 copy NAME IN, NAME OUT, TELEPHONE
LIFAT ENVOY consolidated run: 1 copy AME IN, NAME OUT,
TELEPHAN
The Station now receives two runs of LIFEAT and in addition to the runs
listed above, also receives listings by Subject, symbol and diacritical
mark. Does the Station no longer need these three types of listings and
will one instead of two LIFFAT runs be satisfactory for the Station's
needs? The Station receives an extra (third) copy of the yearly cumulative
run. Will the Station want one extra cony of the LIFEAT/LIE VOY yearly
cumulative ZONAR rur, also?
Does the Stationment the ZONAR run for LIEVOY to bear the
classification of SECRET?
3. With respect to the use of Subject and Symbol codes for LIENVOY ZOMAN
abstracting: Whether the runs are in English or Spanish, LIVOY can use the
same symbol column symbols as those which appear in the sterile manual.
(Some
symbols such as II which indicates LCHARVEST material have been deleted from the
symbols passed to Liaison services.)
With respect to the subject codes, the field may translate directly into Spanish
the English words against which subject codes have already been assigned, and then
abbreviate these words into four letter groups. If the Spanish is used, please
submit your list of Spanish abbreviations for Headquarters information records.

1. Subject's application for "rentista" status in Mexico is
being processed by Gobernacion and LIKAYAK/2 has been requested by
Gobernacion Undersecretary Fernando ROMAN Lugo to check with ODYCKE
as to whether Subject has any derogatory background. ROMAN Lugo is
particularly interested in preventing any American with Communist
connection from settling in Mexico.
2. Subject is described as a North American of Russian origin;
the origin is probably shat brought about the request for traces,
and the Station for the time being attaches no other significance
to the query.
3. LIKAYAK/2 is being told that there is no derogatory infor-
mation on Subject and that if any are developed through a query to
Headquarters, he will be notified. No further action is contemplated.
