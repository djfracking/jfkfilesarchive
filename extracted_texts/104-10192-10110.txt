to request ODCA approval of the creation of this Coordinating
Committee and ODCA recognition of CLASC as its chosen hemispheric
labor instrument. The eventual approval of the ODCA leadership
appears likely; indeed, it is doubtful that the Act would have
emerged from the Montevideo Seminar if informal agreement of the
ODCA leadership had not been obtained in advance.
12. Negative CLASC Influence on Party Youth Wings. Closer
CLASC identification with the CD political movement will likely
rub off negatively on the CD youth wings which invariably are further
left than their parent parties and identify much more closely with
the revolutionary image and mystique CLASC has som and propagated.
It is perhaps significant that CLASC has intensified its efforts
since January to establish youth appendages to the Christian labor
movement. This initiative appears to have made greatest-progress.

IV THE ROLE OF ODCA:
The Latin
ODCA Contributes Little Positive Direction.
American CD partics formed their regional organization in
Montevideo in 1949 -- the Organizacion Democrata Cristiana de
America (ODCA). The current officers of ODCA are:
President
:
Rafael Caldera, Venezuela
•
Vice President : Hector CORNEJO Chavez, Peru
Vice President
Rene DE LEON Schlotter, Guatemala
Secretary General: Tomas REYES Vicuna, Chile
ODCA has consistently assumed an anti-Yankee posture on a broad
range of key issues (most forcefully on the American intervention
in the Dominican Republic) but on balance has been less strident
in its criticism than several of its member partics (notably the
Chilean, Bolivian and Dominican CD's), probably because of
Caldera's restraining hand. The Organization would merit much
closer attention than we have given it to date if it had substantial
influence on or authority over member parties, or could apply
sanctions against national groups. But ODCA amounts to little
more than a fraternity. Its member parties have little ideological
homogencity and the cement of their union appears to be based more
on revolutionary mysticism (which most parties are careful to
qualify with adjectives like peaceful, democratic and Christian)
and im negative factors (hostility to the U.S., capitalism and the
oligarchies), than on a foundation of CD doctrine or basic agree-.
ment on just what they want.
14. Efforts to Firm Up the ODCA Role. We have asked contacts
in European CD circles to prod ODCA to set criteria for membership
and behavior and that the Europeans weigh petitions for support.
from the Latin American parties and organizations against these
criteria. DYVOUR officers have argued that while the Europeans
cannot realistically require nascent and ill-trained CD groups in
Latin America to hold to the same rigid standards of political
morality that have evolved in Europe, neither should the Europeans

continue to tolerate and thus abet the irresponsibility of the
Latin CD parties because there are no standards at all. ODCA
leader Caldera appears to recognize the need for least some
basic idcological common ground among ODCA-member parties. But
no signal success has been achieved in this direction to date
and we are not at all sanguine that even modest progress will be
made in this regard in the foreseeable future. Reporting on the
Congress of the World Christian Democratic Union (CDU) held in
Lims in April 1966 indiestès clearly that the Latin American
parties will not submit without combat to any effort (whether
initiated by the European financial backers of the CD movement
or by OBCA) that aims at imposing standards and controls that
will implage on their complete freedom of action.
→
15. Formation of Central American Regional Grouping. The
Central American CD parties act in El Salvador in July 1966 to
establish a smaller regional grouping, The Union Democrata Cristiana
de Centroamerica (UDCCA). This action does not appear to reflect
any element of pique with ODCA (the relations of COPEI and Rafael
Caldera with the Central American parties appear close and cordial)
but rather a desire to establish a smaller and more cohesive unit
that can better address itself to the problems comon to the
area and, to a lesser extent, to the individual CD parties. UDCCA
is comprised of five parties (in Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua,
Costa Rica and Panama), with the possibility that a sixth party
will be formed in Honduras.

EUROPEAN CD ROLE AND INFLUENCE
16. The European Christian Democratic Union (ECDU). The
European CD partics were first to establish a regional organization,
the Nouvelle Equipe Internationales (NEI) in 1947. The NEI never
played a major role in world Christian Democratic affairs. From
the outset the Latin American parties maintained their closest
ties with individual leaders of the CD movement in Europe, particu-
larly those involved in financial operations with the sister parties
and CLASC in Latin America. The NEI became progressively less

mid-1965 the organization was revamped and re-christened as the
European Christian Democratic Union (ECDU). Its newly elected
President, Mariano Rumor, Secretary General of the Italian PDC,
appears intent on making the ECEU a strong organization which will
at least match the Socialist International in stature.
"
17. European Financial Support to the CD Parties. The two CD
organizations which have contributed most heavily to the support
of the Latin American CD parties and related organizations are the
Institute for International Solidarity (IIS) and the International
Solidarity Foundation (FIS). Between them they will contribute
an estimated $500,000 to $1,000,000 to the CD parties and CLASC in
Calendar Year 1967. It was recently reported that the COPEI party.
of Venezuela will receive $450,000 for the 1968 election from FIS
at the rate of $160,000 per year commencing in 1966.
3. The IIS. The Institute for International Solidarity,
headed until recently by Dr. Peter Molt (the new Director is
Adolf Herkenrath), is an arm of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation
of the German Christian Democratic Union (CDU). Like its

18. Difference in Function of IIS and FIS. From the start
of its activities, the Germans and Italians have contributed
almost the entire FIS budget (in 1964, for example, Vanistendael
contributed only $15,000 from the CISC International Solidarity
Fund). FIS appears to be the exclusive European CD channel for
örganizational support to the Latin American CD parties. While
the IIS is the rich partner in the IIS-FIS tandem and could easily
fund the Latin American parties directly, the FIS channel is
preferred by the Germans and has two major advantages: First,
since IS is a regional solidarity instrument with representation
(but not contributions) from all the European parties, the
responsibility for support to certain controversial Latin parties
is watered down and distributed among the European CD's collectively.
Thus a Latin American government or party in competition with the
local CD's cannot easily make a formal demarche to the IIS or the
German government. Second, it is easier to obfuscate the magnitude
of European organizational support to the Christian Democratic
movement in Latin America if it is channeled through a multi-party
organization. The Germans have limited IIS funding to less
.controversial areas support to youth and student formation,
political training institutes and CLASC training institutes.

CONCLUSIONS
CD's Challenge Comunist Domination of the University.
It was noted in Para. 5 above that almost without exception CD.
strength in the university greatly exceeds the voting strength of
the parent party. The same is true of the Communists, and it is
a fact that Communist/Christian Democratic strength on the campus
is overwhelmingly dominant throughout the hemisphere. Few would
take issue with the conclusion that the vast majority of university
youth are attracted to movements projecting an inspirational
message (the word "inspirational" more accurately characterizes
the CD movement than does "ideological") or an aura of revolutionary
mystique. During the past few years Communist voting losses in
the university have been picked up mainly by the Christian Democrats
the vote has shifted from one movement with a message to another.
It would appear that the Christian Democrats are the only political
group capable of challenging the Communists' hemisphoric domination
of the campus.

23. Growth Potential Exists, But Much Less Than Originally
Anticipated. The CD movement has made only modest progress the
past two years. Indications are that the development of the
movement will be much slower and less extensive than many anti-
cipated in the first flush of enthusiasm following the Frei
victory, for it has many problems to resolve. Chief among these,
perhaps, is CD failure to reach the lower social classes and to
develop a significant worker base. The chances of CLASC contri-
buting positively to correct this failure appear remote.
major problem is the absence of an ideological commonnground,
Another
despite the lip service paid to the Papal Encyclicals and the
Catholic social philosophers, and the failure to enunciate minimum
behavioral standards that these philosophical roots would impose.
This deficiency is the root cause of two manifestations: First,
a propensity to consort with Communist and assorted Marxist groups
(c.g., in Colombia, Bolivia, the Dominican Republic and Panama).
Second, the progressive radicalization of party youth wings which
threatens to push the parent parties further left. The fact;
remains, nevertheless, that Christian Democracy is the most unified
non-Communist movement in Latin America. It cannot be labeled
democratic or anti-Communist because of the behavioral aberrations
of several national parties.
24. Need for Eclectic Operational Approach to CD's. The
ranks of those who viewed Christian Democratic prospects with
great enthusiasm. two years ago -- including the European financial
backers of the movement -- have dwindled considerably. But those
who have been critics of Christian Democracy from the outset (many
of whom might be described as the "visceral denigrators") have
displayed no more perception in evaluating CD prospects. The
head-in-the-sand generalization that Christian Democracy has no
future does not stand the challege of investigation. Neither does
the assertion that Christian Democracy is the hemispheric wave of
the future. The only valid generalization that might be made on
CD prospects is that all generalizations are false. We would
submit that the only valid approach to the CD phenomenon is to assess
the movement and make operational judgements on a country-by-
country basis. There are some countries where the collapse of
the party would be no loss. The key question is: Can the party
develop as a positive element in national political stability?
If so, it is incumbent on the Station to develop assets within
the party and to examine the need for operational involvement.
Station posture toward the CD movement must be based on the raw
realities of the local situation, case by case,

CHRISTIAN DEMOCRACY IN LATIN AMERICA
The decisive victory of Eduardo Frei in the Sep-
tember 1964 Chilean presidential election led many to
hope that Christian Democracy would develop signifi-.
cantly throughout Latin America, competing with Com-
munism on ideological grounds and offering an alterna-
tive, democratic route to social and economic progress.
No such trend has yet developed. The Christian
Democratic movement's appeal is to students and middle
class, a relatively small percentage of the population
in most Latin American countries. Its concepts of
basic social reform and the dignity of the human person
may appeal to the workers, but they still cast their
vote on a pragmatic basis for the least objectionable
of the established parties that have an immediate chance
of governing.
The movement's progress is likely to be hampered
by its lack of strong leaders and effective labor or-
ganizations to compete against the entrenched posi-
tions of other political movements.
Current Balance Sheet
The Christian Democratic
movement is generally agreed to
be of current political signifi-
cance in only four Latin American
countries--Chile, Peru, Venezuela,
and El Salvador.
In only one of these--Chile--
is the Christian Democratic Party
(PDC) the governing party. Frei's
solid victory in the 1964 presi-
dential election was followed by
an even more impressive showing.
in the March 1965 congressional
election. However, the party's
reform program has run into dif-
ficulty in the upper house of
Congress, which is still con-
trolled by the opposition; no
progress has been made in weaken-
ing Marxist domination of the
urban labor force; and Frei's
moderation has been increasingly
challenged by the left wing of
his own party, which may capture
control in the next two or three
years.
The only other Christian
Democratic party with a claim to
a role in government is the one
in Perú. It was brought into a
pre-election coalition by the
dominant Popular Action Party
in 1963 and, although it gained
only four percent of the votes,
it holds two cabinet posts. Its
voting strength has been weakened
recently by the defection of a
dissident faction which formed a
separate Popular Christian Party.

20. Strength in University No Indicator of CD Party
Strength of Recential. From the foregoing, however, it does
not follow that the growth of CD strength in the university
presages a corresponding increase in CD party strength. While
voting patterns in the university provide valuable insights on
population (particularly youth) attitudes and aspirations, these
patterns are not a reliable barometer of either organized party
strength or future potential. In no country of Latin America
is the voting strength of the 's or the Communists nearly as
strong among the population at large as it is on the campus..
One reason is that the university population of Latin America is
less than 2 percent of the total population. The CD campus leader
almost invariably graduates from student politics to more direct
party involvement when he leaves the university. -- even if the
party has no discernable future. It would appear, however, that
the non-university youth (locking the pseudo-intellectual pre-
tensions and the self-bestowed elite label of the university-
trained) are much less inclined to vote and militate for Christian
Democracy simply because it has emotional or inspirational appeal.
21. CD Failure to Transform Affinity of Lower Classes Into
Votes. The inadequately educated and the lower social classes in
Latin America are inevitably motivated by the pragmatism of the
possible; to vote for a party that has limited potential to achieve
national power, simply because it espouses views that hit responsive
chords, is a luxury ho believes he cannot afford. Better, he
thinks, to vote for the least objectionable of the traditional
parties. Christian Democracy remains basically a middle-class
mover. With few exceptions (Chile, the Dominican Republic and
to a lesser extent Venezuela) it has scant worker or campesino
appeal. By and large, Christian Democracy has failed to reach
those on the lower rungs of the social ladder.
22. Individual Party Fortumes Appear Unaffected by CD
Progress Elsewhere. Many expected, or at least hoped, that the
Frei victory in Chile would give impetus to the development of
the CD movement throughout the hemisphere. This has not happened.
There is no evidence that individual CD parties were either assisted
And
or hindered in their development by the Chilean success story.
yet the view persists that the Chiltan victory was a boon to the
movement's potential and progress. During the past year COPEI
leader Rafael Caldera has broadcast a variation on this theme that
several European CD leaders have taken up. They argue that COPEI
must emerge victorious in the 1958 election if the CD movement is
to maintain its momentum, for an idcologically based movement
cannot avoid peaking off, and gradually down, if it has only one
significant victory to cite over a period of several years.
would reject the view -- based on election results in Argentina,
Colombia, El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Uruguay
individual party fortunes will be affected in any significant
measure by the successes or failures of sister parties elsewhere.
What appears to emerge from these elections is rather solid
evidence that the national parties will sink or swim on their
cm devices, based largely on leadership abilities, the development
of middle cchelor cadres, organizational talents, appeal to the
"socially disinherited," and the pragmatism of local issues and
considerations. International events (with rare exception) count
for little, and the influence of ODCA and the successful CD parties
even less.

Several CD leaders, most
notably Frei in Chile and Caldera
in Venezuela, have expressed con-
siderable concern over the grow-
ing radicalization of party youth
wings. In several countries the
positions assumed by CD youth.
groups (or important wings) are
almost indistinguishable from
those of pro-Communist youth ele-
ments. In Venezuela, the wing
of the COPEI youth headed by
Marta Sosa is so "far out" it
has earned the sobriquet "the
Astronauts." Chilean President
Frei reportedly told a German
Christian Democrat that his youth
wing is moving dangerously far
to the left. In Panama, the
-dominant wing of the CD youth has
assumed positions at least as
radical as the Communists. And
in the Dominican Republic the
Social Christian group in the Na-
tional University, while differ-
entiating itself from the Commu-
nist students on certain issues,
has frequently taken a parallel
line.
The great concern of respon-
sible party leaders is that these
students, as they progress from
campus to parent party, will swell
the ranks of the radical wings
and push the parties further left.
Other observers, however, expect
the "hotheads" to mellow once
they participate directly in
party life and cope with hard
political reality. Both views
can be defended. Some mellowing
is inevitable, but in the past
ten years the demand for revolu-
tionary (even convulsive) change
has mushroomed--and among the
youth the cry has assumed much
greater proportions.
Both German and American
observers have commented that
massive and intensive political
training of youth and political
cadres might arrest this drift
to the left. Frei and Caldera
have specifically asked the West
German CD party's Institute for .
International Solidarity to in-
crease its support in the student
training field. However, the
Germans, who have long been pro-
ponents of organizational programs
in Latin America, appear inclined
to the position in the youth and
student field that party leaders
have permitted the situation to
deteriorate too long for even a
massive training program to pro-
duce a moderating trend.
The Labor Arm
A major influence in the
development of the Christian
Democratic movement will be the
actions and attitudes of its
labor organization, the Latin
American Confederation of Chris-
tian Trade Unionists (CLASC).
So far, as an organized force, it
has been, a dismal failure except
among the campesinos. Its only
impact and sole purpose up to
this time has been as a political
action instrument with primary
appeal to the working classes.
In this role, it has earned a
reputation for independent action
and irresponsibility that has re-
flected negatively on the whole
movement despite CLASC's vigorous
claims that it is not subservient
to the Christian Democratic po-
litical leaders.
In spite of the apparent
differences between CLASC and

1962, but the party had signifi-
cant strength in three important
south-central states (Parana,
Sao Paulo, and Guanabara). Like
all other Brazilian parties, it
was abolished during a political
reorganization under the Castello
Branco administration. Most of
its members then affiliated with

and campaigned under its banner
in the November 1966 congressional
elections. It is unlikely that
there will be any significant ex-
pansion in the number of politi-
cal parties--the new Brazilian
constitution sets down stringent.
1. standards that virtually eliminate
the possibility of a repetition
of the former proliferation of
parties. The former PDC has made
no attempt to reconstitute itself,
but its former members will prob-
ably join with like-minded con-
gressmen to pursue policies con-
sistent with Christian Democratic
ideology.
The Guatemalan PDC was only
recently recognized as a legally
constituted party.
This group,
which is being financed by Cath-
olic sources in Germany and Bel-
gium, has some strength in the
youth and student movement and
some growth potential among the
campesinos who make up more than
half the population. Current
direction of the party leaves much
to be desired; its leader, Rene de
Leon, appears honest, but he has
little organizational flair or
popular appeal. With more vigo-
rous leadership and the develop-
ment of a middle-echelon cadre,
the party might develop signifi-
cantly--particularly if the in-
cumbent Revolutionary Party (PR)
administration fails to resolve
basic problems confronting it.
"
The remaining nine Chris-
tian Democratic parties--in Ar-
gentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Costa
Rica, Ecuador, Mexico, Nicaraguá,
Paraguay, and Uruguay--show scant
promise of developing into forces
of national importance over the
next five years. Leadership of
even modest stature exists only
in Argentina (Salvador Alende,
Horacio Sueldo) and Bolivia
(Remo di Natale).
Party Youth Wings
As with all political groups
in Latin America, the vast major-
ity of CD party militants. come
from student organizations in the
local universities. In most
countries of the hemisphere, CD.
voting strength on the campus is
much greater than the political
strength of the parent party.
A few examples illustrate this
point: In Panama, the party
polled 3.1 percent of the national
vote in 1964 (and probably would
poll not more than 5 percent to-
day); but its university youth
got 12.8 percent in the January
1966 campus election and 24.4
percent in January 1967. The
Dominican PPSC received 5.4 per-
cent of the vote in 1962 (and its
present strength could well be
lower because of internal divi-

Venezuela's Christian Demo-
crats (COPEI) have strong hopes
of duplicating the victory of the
Chilean party in 1968 and appear
to have narrowed the gap between
their 22 percent of the elector-
ate in 1963 and the governing
Democratic Action's 32 percent.
COPEI Secretary General Rafael
Caldera, one of the few Latin
American CD leaders of interna-
tional stature, is expected to
be the party's standard bearer
in his fourth try for the presi-
dency. He has recently come out
in favor of a politically expe-
dient move to the right, thus
filling the vacuum of the center-
right of the Venezuelan political
spectrum and opening new sources
of support.
"
In El Salvador, the PDC
garnered 31.2 percent of the
votes in the March 1966 legisla-
tive election and one of its.
leaders, Jose Napoléon Duarte,
retained the mayoralty of San
Salvador. In less than six years
the PDC has become the leading
opposition party. It has little
chance of capturing the presi-
dency in 1967, but should be a
strong contender by 1972, with
Notre Dame - educated Mayor
Duarte the likely candidate.
Applying even the most gen-
erous criteria to the judgment
of potential, there are not more
than four other CD parties--in
the Dominican Republic, Panama,
Brazil, and Guatemala--that might
develop as moderately important
forces over the next five years.
The Dominican Revolutionary
Social Christian Party (PRSC),
led by Coanabo Javier, has aban-
doned, at least for the time being,
the irresponsible policies it
adopted after the April 1965 re-
volt and has moved toward the po-
litical center. The party has
made its opposition to the Bala-
guer government clear, but has
also indicated that it intends to
operate within bounds acceptable
to the President. The PRSC hopes
that this moderate: line will in-
crease its following and enable
it to improve on the poor showing
it made in the 1966 elections.
The party has developed a small
but talented cadre, primarily
from the university ranks.
The Panamanian PDC was reg-
istered some five years ago and
polled only 3.1 percent of the
votes in 1964. Although it con-
tinues a minuscule party, it has
made significant organizational
strides and its philosophy of
social justice gives it roots.
lacked by most Panamanian parties,
which are largely personalistic
or tied to financial interests.
The PDC is currently negotiating
with the mass-based Panamenista
Party of Arnulfo Arias--Panama's
largest--in hopes of forming a
coalition for the May 1968 elec-
tions. The CDs have offered to
provide the Panamenistas with
much-needed administrative skills
in return for a share of the as-
sembly seats in the next election.
A long-range goal would be to
acquire support within Arias'
party and inherit his mass fol-
lowing when he passes from the
scene.
The Brazilian PDC polled

the CD movement, a closer and
more formal relationship appears
to be in the offing. Last April,
officials of: CLASC who are also
officers of the Christian Demo-
cratic parties met in Montevideo
to arrange closer coordination
between the two groups. To ac-
complish this goal, they proposed
that both the CD party labor de-
partments and CLASC be granted'
formal representation in the
Christian Democratic Organiza-
tion of America (ODCA), the re-
gional grouping formed in 1949...
The plan has not yet been.
implemented, but eventual ODCA
approval appears likely. Closer
CLASC identification with the CD
political movement may have an
adverse effect on CD youth
wings, which--being further left
than their parent parties--have
identified more closely with
CLASC's revolutionary image.
Since the first of the year,
CLASC has intensified its ef-
forts to create its own youth
groups and appears to have made
some progress, especially in
Central America.
The Role of ODCA
In its 17 years of existence,
ODCA has not evolved beyond a
sort of fraternity held together
more by negative factors such as
hostility to the US, to capital-
ism, and to the oligarchies, than
by any basic agreement among it's
members on doctrine or principles.
Moreover, the individual parties
have made very clear that they
will fight any effort--whether
initiated by ODCA or by the Eu-
ropean financial backers of the
CD movement--to impose standards
and controls that will impinge
on their freedom of action.
In general, ODCA takes a
slightly less hostile line on
US policies than that of its
member parties. This probably
results from the influence of
its president, Rafael Caldera of
Venezuela. The organization's
two vice presidents are Hector
Cornejo Chavez of Peru and Rene
De Leon of Guatemala. Tomas Reyes
Vicuna of Chile is its secretary
general.
Only in Central America has
there been any move toward a
more cohesive unit geared to area
problems. A smaller regional
group, the Christian Democratic
Union of Central America, was or-
ganized last July. It now has
five member parties, in Guatemaia,
El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica,
and Panama, and a sixth may be
formed in Honduras.
European Role and Influence
Although Latin American
Christian Democracy like the Eu-
ropean variety, has its roots in
the profoundly humanistic and
democratic ideas of the French
philosopher Jacques Maritain, it
does not contain the European
fascist concept of the corporate
state. The European reaction to
the growth of Communism in the
1930s had little effect on the
Latin American CDs; consequently
the Americans were moving to the
political left as the Europeans
were moving to the right.
Not until 1947 did the newly
important and affluent European

CDs attempt to coordinate inter-
national CD activity through an
organization they called the New
International Team (NEI). This
organization never achieved any
significance because European
influence in Latin America had
already been undermined by a basic
difference in political philosophy
and because the Latin American
parties had been maintaining in-
dividual relations with the var-
ious European groups. These ties
were strictly on vague ideological
grounds and for financial reasons.
-
The two heaviest European
contributors to the Latin Ameri-
can parties are the Institute for
International Solidarity. (IIS) and
the International Solidarity
Foundation (FIS). Between them
they will contribute an estimated
$800,000 to $1,000,000 to the
American CD parties and CLASC in
calendar year 1967. In addition,
it was recently reported that
the COPEI party of Venezuela will
receive $480,000 for the 1968
election from FIS.

of Adolf Herkenrath, is an arm

It has assumed this responsibility
because it is composed of repre- .

the executive committee that he was going directly to Caracas,
Venezuela. It was not until after his return that it was
learned that he had not gone to Caracas or to Guatemala as
he had planned. He later explained that while he was in
Puerto Rico he telephoned his relative in Guatemala and was
informed that the latter had "failed in his efforts."
Field Comment. Presumably he was referring to an interview
with President Julio Cesar Mendez Montenegro which Batista
had earlier said had been arranged by his cousin. (Cf.

Source Comment. The document, as originally drafted, was
modified because Barbeite felt that the tone was too strong.
Also, the amount of money requested was reduced to $10,000.

$75,000 would be requested. (Cf. UFG-8327)) (@508 -

AMMOP Circular Letter to Identity A Leaders and Organizations
ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES
AR:
FYI
REF: WAVE 9754
1. As indicated in reference, the AMMOP organization on
15 March 1966 sent a circular letter based on Fidel Castro's
13 March speech to Identity A individuals and organizations.
The letter, which was signed and composed by AMMOP/1 and which
was accompanied by transcripts of the speech, condemned Castro's
attack on Chilean President Eduardo Frei; requested support for
Frei's position; and asked the recipients to join the struggle
maintained by the Cuban people to overthrow Fidel Castro and
prepare for the freedom of Cuba from Communism.
2. The youth wing of the ANMOP group, headed by AMCRIB/1,
mailed a letter to its Identity A youth contacts based on the
13 and 20 March speeches by Fidel Castro along the lines cited
above. Included in this letter were the strong anti-Castro
statements made by Identity B. Copies of both letters are for-
warded under separate cover.
3.
According to AMMOP/1, his letter was replayed by FUSEE
and was the basis for an article in a Santiago newspaper by
Identity C.

Estimado demócratacristiano:
Después de leer una copia literal del discurso pronuncia-
do por Castro, en la escalinata de la Universidad de La Habana, el
pasado 13 de marzo, me considero obligado con el Gobierno, el Par-
tido Demócrata Cristiano y el pueblo chileno, que fueron innoble-
mente atacados por Castro durante el transcurso de su alocución, a
expresar mi opinión con relación a dicha ofensa.
Digo obligado, porque el hecho de ser demócratacristiano
cubano, integrante de esa gran comunidad de seres humanos que un
día se dieron a la tarea de realizar una revolución en libertad y
que lamentablemente vieron tronchadas sus aspiraciones al compro-
bar que las mismas eran ahogadas por la sangre vertida en los pa-
redones de fusilamientos por héroes como Porfirio Ramirez, Presi-
denta de la FEU de la provincia de Las Villas en Cuba y el Dr.Hum
berto Sori Marín, Comandante del Ejército Rebelde y autor de la
primera Ley de Reforma Agraria; debe servirme de experiencia para
expresar lo que pienso decir a través de estas lineas. Digo obli-
gado, porque en igual forma que nosotros hemos pedido en múlti-
ples oportunidades, colaboración y solidaridad con nuestra lucha,
solicitud que lamentablemente no ha sido respondida por algunos,
alegando unas veces desconocimiento y otras imputándonos incom-
prensión con el "proceso revolucionario" que se está llevando a
cabo en Cuba, no queremos que en esta oportunidad en que son los
compañeros chilenos los que necesitan de nuestra solidaridad, va-
yamos a encontrar a alguien que por desconocimiento, no se decida
a respaldar públicamente al Gobierno, Partido y pueblo de Chile
en la actitud cívica y valiente adoptada frente a las ofensas ex-
presadas por Castro durante su discurso, entre las cuales trans-
cribimos las siguientes: "A decir verdad, siempre he creido que
Frei es un representante de la burguesía chilena, que su gobier-
no es un gobierno de la burguesía. Jamás he creido que Frei vaya
a hacer ninguna revolución".... posteriormente, al referirse a
los sucesos provocados por los comunistas en la mina de cobre del'
Salvanor donde murieron varias personas dijo: "Frei es un reaccio
naric Frei ha demostrado con este hecho, no ser un individuo de
mano irme, sinó un individuo cobarde, que abusa del poder,..

Frei ha demostrado ser un mentiroso. Frei ha demostrado ser un po-
litiquero vulgar que para justificar su sanguinario gesto, trata
de culpar a la Tri-Continental. Frei se desenmascara. Frei demues-
tra al pueblo de Chile y al mundo qué tipo de revolución es la
que va a hacer, qué tipo de gobierno es el que va a llevar adelan-
te. Es decir, no una revolución sin sangre, sinó una política de
sangre sin revolución; sangre sin revolución, esa es la política
de Frei, sangre sin revolución, ese es el gobierno de Frei, sangre
Isin revolución, esa es la política de la Alianza para el Progreso".
Después de estas expresiones, no podemos menos que salirle
al paso a Castro y a la camarilla que desgobierna hoy a Cuba, e
instar y pedir mayor colaboración con los patriotas que hoy ofren-
"dan sus vidas por liberar a Cuba, a fin de evitar no solo la con-
tinuada masacre de cubanos que se lleva a cabo en la Isla, sino
tambien ponerle fin a todos estos incidentes bochornosos para la
historia, en los que aparece un cubano, ofendiéndo públicamente
ante el mundo a un Presidente, a un Partido y a un pueblo que a
contrario sensus de lo que él esta haciendo en Cuba, si está rea-
lizando una revolución en libertad, sí ha defendido en todo momen
to el sano nacionalismo, si se ha puesto de frente cuantas veces
sí
las circunstancias lo han requerido a los oligarcas y explotado-
res.
Para terminar, sólo me queda reiterarle, que en nombre de
la solidaridad que une a todos los demócratacristianos, exprese
públicamente, su deseo de colaborar con la lucha que mantiene el
pueblo cubano por derrocar al castrocomunismo y poder realizar en
Cuba, una verdadera revolución en libertad, así como su respaldo
a la actitud asumida por el Gobierno, el Partido Demócrata Cris-
tiano y el pueblo chileno en los actuales momentos.
Pendiente de su atención y respuesta y dejando constancia
de mi mayor consideración, quedo suyo
Cordialmente,

Estimado compañero:
?
La JDC de Cuba, fiel al pensamiento de nuestro Apostol
José Martí que dice: "ver en silencio un crimenes cometerlo", no
ha queridɔ marginarse del daño que Castro quiere hacerle a la
Revolución en Libertad, que está realizando el Presidente Eduar-
do Frei, su Gobierno y el Partido Demócrata Cristiano de Chile.
Consciente de que es posible que no te hayan llegado
muchas de las informaciones relacionadas con los innobles ata-
ques públicos de Castro a Frei y su Gobierno, calificándo al Pre
sidente de "representante de la burguesía chilena", "reaccionario”
"mimado del imperialismo yanqui y guardián de sus intereses en
Chile.....etc. Hemos querido comunicarte, no sólo los ataques de
Castro a Frei, sino una de las muchas respuestas que se le han
dado Castro. Nos referimos a la que en dias pasados hiciera el
Diputado Democrata-Cristiano Chileno, Alfredo Lorca y que a con-
tinuación transcribimos "Realmente. Fidel Castro es un caso dig-
no de análisis. Hace pocos dias atrás, según expresaron diputa-
dos que estuvieron en Cuba, Castro dijo que Frei era un gran Pre-
sidente. Agregó que si el hubiera estado en Chile, habría hecho
lo mismo que Frei.
Pero ahora, porque se le ha tocado la epidermis de la
Tri-Continental, Frei se transforma en un Castro Cualquiera.
Yo estuve en Cuba -añadió Lorca- en 1959 cuando Castro
subió al poder. En esa ocasión le pregunté al ver a tantos hom-
bres armados, si pensaba reorganizar al ejército. Y él me contes-
tó, con ese modo tan tropical: "chico, armas para qué cuando se
tiene al pueblo".
Sin embargo, añadió. Lorca- en los siete años que Fidel
tiene al pueblo detrás de 61, anda mas armado que un militar en
plena guerra. En Chile, todos los Presidentes que yo recuerdo, los

The following analysis has been prepared in WII Division and
is transmitted to all Wi Division Stations and Bases as a review
of the current status of Christian Democracy in Latin America and
an updating of Headquarters' view on the movement. We believe
the subject matter merits close and careful study by all Station
operations and reports officers whose comments are solicited.
FYI, this material, in a shorter and sanitized form was published
in the 3 March issue of the Current Intelligence Weekly Review,
and will thus be widely disseminated throughout the intelligence
community. However, the WOGEAR study could not include much of
the "Conclusions" section since it was interpretative and had
operational overtones. Thus we've decided to send the full text
herein in book dispatch form.

1. The decisive victory of Eduardo Frei in the September 1964
Chilean Presidential election led many to hope that Christian
Democracy might develop significantly throughout Latin America
competing with Communism on idcological grounds and offering an
alternative, democratic route to social and economic progress.
Christian Democracy's advocacy of "Third Force" concepts plus
frequent manifestations of anti-Yankee syndrome caused some
observers to swallow hard, but there was no denying that these
concepts had an emotional appeal. This political charisma,
coupled with a commitment to, basic social reform and opposition to
Communism, and presented within an ideological framework stressing
the dignity of the human person, comprised a package of considerable
attractiveness to the Latin American, particularly the student and
middle class clements. This dispatch will review the current status

No se puede decir que Frei sea un cobarde, un mentiroso
ý un déspota como Fidel Castro afirma añadió Lorca- En cambio
61 está resguardado por metralletas y no puede dormir, ni se le
conoce domicilio fijo porque los hijos de los muertos en el pare-
don le buscan. Además -puntualizó Lorca- vale la pena destacar que
nadie se ha ido de Chile. En cambio, es público y notorio que más
de 300 000 personas han huido del paraiso fidelista. Y me atrevo.
a penzer que si Fidel Castro diera libertad a quienes quieren ir-
se de Cuba, se quedarfa solo con sus barbas y su hermano Raúl,
porque Camilo Cienfuegos ya no está. Dicen que se cayó de un avión.
Finalmente, Lorca recordó el caso del que fuera Presiden-
to de los tribunales populares de Cuba, Sori Marín."Es un hombre
Integro, puro y extremadamente justo", decía Castro de él. "Estoy
seguro que nunca condenaría a quien no mereciera la pena de muer-
te". obstante una mañana amaneció de mal genio y el Sr. Sori
Marin. He convirtió en un agente de la Central de Inteligencia de
los Estados Unidos. Resultado: hizo fusilar a ese hombre puro,
Integro y justo.".
Estas palabras, expuestas por el Diputado D.C. Alfredo
Lorca, señalando algunas de las muchas contradicciones de Castro,
ratifican una vez más lo que la JDC de Cuba a través de sus di-
rigentes, le ha venido diciendo a toda la juventud demócratacris-
tiana de América y que hoy, con más fuerza y moral que núnca nos
permite pedirte en nombre de la solidaridad que nos une, que ex-
pongas públicamente tu respaldo a la Revolución en Libertad que
viene realizando el Pueblo, Gobierno y Partido Demócrata Cristia
no de Chile así como tu colaboración a la lucha que mantiene el
pueblo cubano por derrocar al castrocomunismo existente en nues-
tra Patria.

represent key factors in the development of the Christian Democratic
movement in Latin America. Our major purpose is to determine, some
two years after the Frei victory, whether the generally enthusiastic
assessment of Christian Democratic prospects engendered by this
highly significant election was justified.
I - CURRENT BALANCE SHEET OF CHRISTIAN DEMOCRACY
2. Parties of Current Significance. Christian Democratic
parties are generally agreed to be of current political significance
in only four Latin American countries Chile, Venezuela, El
Salvador and Peru.
--
8. The Chilean PDC is the only party with the respon-
sibility of governing; the solid victory of Frei in the 1964
presidential election was followed by an even more impressive
showing in the March 1965 congressional election. However, the
Party's reform program is being implemented with less than
deliberate speed, no progress has been made in weakening
Marxist leadership domination of the urban labor force, and
indications are that Frei's moderation will be increasingly
challenged by the left wing of the PDC.
b. The COPEI Party of Venezuela has strong hopes of
duplicating the victory of the Chilean Party in 1968 and
appears to have narrowed the gap between itself (22 percent
of the electorate in 1963) and the governing Accion Democratica
Party (32 percent). COPEI Secretary General Rafael Caldera,
one of the few Latin American CD leaders of international
stature, is expected to be the Party's standard bearer in his
fourth try for the presidency.
c. In El Salvador, the PDC garnered 29 percent of the
votes in the March 1966 legislative election and one of its
leaders, Jose Napoleon Duarte, retained the mayoralty of San
Salvador. In less than six years the PDC has become the
leading opposition party. It has little chance of capturing
the presidency in 1967, but should be a strong contender by
1972, with Notre Dame-educated Mayor Duarte the likely
candidate.
d. The Peruvian PDC formed a coalition with the Popular
Action (AP) Party in 1963; it currently holds two cabinet
positions. Some would argue that the Peruvian CD (with only
4 percent of the votes in 1963) has no real future in compe-
tition with the dominant AP and the long-established APRA,
both reformist parties, and thus should not be included in a
listing of significant CD parties. Some weight is added to
this argument by the very recent split off of a dissident
faction of the PDC into a separate party. However, the
inclusion of the Peruvian party here is based primarily on the
fact that it is the only CD group participating in a coalition
government and thus contributes an element of stability to the
political scene in Peru.

3. Parties of Moderate Potential. Applying even the most
generous criteria to the judgement of potential, there are not
more than four CD parties in the Dominican Republic, Panama,
Brazil and Guatemala that might develop as moderately important
forces over the next five years.
--
'S. The Dominican PRSC stands as a prime example of
CD irresponsibility from the time Caonabo Javier took over
Party leadership in the wake of the Dominican Revolution in
April 1965. It has collaborated with the entire spectrum of
Marxist-lining parties, and moderation of its extreme
militancy in the near future appears unlikely. The PRSC has
developed a small but talented cadre of leadership, primarily
from the university ranks, and is buttressed by the strongest
CLASC affiliate (CASC) in the Hemisphere.
b. The Panamanian PDC was registered some five years
ago and polled only 3.1 percent of the votes in 1964. Although
it continues a miniscule party, it has made significant
organizational strides and its philosophy of social justice
gives it roots lacking by most Panamanian parties, which are
largely personalistic or tied to financial interests. If the
Panama CD succeeds in expanding its middle-class base and
attracts militants from the predominantly negro and mestizo
population, it could become a force of some importance.
C. While the Brazilian PDC polled a mere 4 percent of
the vote in 1964, the Party has significant strength in three
key states of the Center-South (Parana, Sao Paulo, and
Guanabara). Like all other pre-Castello Branco political
parties, the PDC was unable to campaign under its own banner
in the presidential and parliamentary elections of late 1966.
Expanded political activity will probably be permitted after
the seating of President Costa e Silva in March 1967, but it
is expected that the number of legally recognized political
parties will be limited. It appears likely that the PDC will
have to merge with another party if it is to compete in the
legislative life of the country. If the PDC joins with a
party that has strength outside the present PDC strongholds,
and the PDC message and mystique sets the tone for such a new
political entity, the net result could be expanded importance
for Christian Democracy in Brazil.
d. The Guatemalan PDC was only recently recognized as
a legally constituted party. This nascent group has good
strength in the youth and student movement and growth
potential in the important campesino sector. Current direction
of the party leaves much to be desired; PPC leader Rene de
Leon appears honest and intelligent but he has little organ-
izational flair or charisma. His leadership is being challenged
by a group of militant "Young Turks" on the left. With more
vigorous leadership and the development of middle echelon
cadres the party could develop significantly.
--
4. Parties of Insignificance. The remaining nine Christian
-Democratic parties in Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica,
Ecuador, Mexico, Nicaragua, Paraguay and Uruguay -- show scant
promise of developing into forces of national importance over the
next five years. Leadership of even modest stature exists only
in Argentins (Salvador Allende, Horacio Sualdo) and Bolivia

II - PARTY YOUTH WINGS
"
As
5.. CD Strength in Universities Ahead of Party Strength.
with all political groups in Latin America, the vast majority of
CD party militants are drawn from the ranks of student appendages
active in the local universities. In most countries of the hemi-
sphere, CD voting strength on the campus is much more significant
than the political strength of the parent party. A few examples
illustrate this point: In Panama, the Party polled 3.1 percent
of the vote in 1964 (and probably would poll not more than 5
percent today), while its University youth got 12.8 percent in the
January 1966 election. The Dominican PRSC received 5.4 percent of
the vote in 1962 (and its present strength could well be lower
because of internal divisions and leadership conflicts), but its
youth wing on the campus garnered 40.2 percent of the vote in
May 1966. In Venezuela, COPEI polled 22 percent of the vote in
1963; its student wing on the campus of the Central University,
however, polled 40.2 percent of the vote in 1966. These comparitive
figures suggest some conclusions which are presented in Paras. 19
and 20 below.
6. Radicalization of Youth Wings. Several CD leaders, most
notably Frei and Caldera, have expressed considerable concern over
the growing radicalization of party youth wings. That youth groups
of every political stripa assume positions to the left of their
partics is nothing new, but the situation in several CD groups has
gotten badly out of hand. In several countries only an opaque line
divides the positions assumed by CD youth groups (or important wings)
from the stance assured by Marxist youth elements. "In Venezuela,
the wing of the COPEI youth headed by Marta Sosa is so "far-out"
it has earned the sobriquet "the Astronauts. Chilean President
Frei reportedly told a German Christian Democrat that his youth
wing is in danger of becoming Marxist. In Panama, the dominant
wing of the CD youth has assumed positions at least as radical as
the Communists. And in the Dominican Republic the Social Christian
group in the National University is allied with the Communist
students.
"
The great
7. Youth Tending to Push Parties Further Left.
concern of responsible party leaders is that youth input to the
parties will swell the ranks of the radical wings and push the
parties further left. Some observers believe that the CD youth
problem has been exaggerated and that the "hot heads" will mellow
once they participate directly in party life and cope with hard
political reality. While this is partially true, we would take
issue with this relaxed view. The raw material to be molded is
far different than it was ten years ago; since that time the demand
for revolutionary (even convulsive) change has mushroomed
among the youth the cry has assumed din proportions. The natural
mellowing process will no longer produce the same magic.
and
S. Need for Training. Some believe that the only way of
arresting the CD youth drift to the left in the foreseeable future
lies in massive and intensive youth and political cadre training.
Efforts in this direction to date (at IFEDEC, several national
political training institutes, ORMEU and various student training

courses) have been discouraging. In most instances the teachers
share identical biases with the students with the result that
misconceptions are reinforced and no new horizons are opened up.
Frei and Caldera have asked the German Institute for International
Solidarity to increase its support in the student training field,
but the Germans, while recognizing the serious need, have thus far
declined to increase their commitment. To accomplish anything
significant, the Germans believe a massive program must be launched
(which would tax their current resources), and they wonder whether
the CD youth situation has been permitted to drift too long to
salvage.
III - THE IMPACT OF CLASC ON THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT
9. CLASC Poses Serious Danger for CD Movement. A KUMONK
study points out that "Organized labor could contribute substantially
to the development of well-organized CD political parties in the.
hemisphere, but it also offers the best chance for CD extremists
to cause harm to the movement." Few would argue that how the CD
movement fares and the image it projects depend in not insignificant
measure on the posture assummed and progress achieved by CLASC.
More often than not, the judgement of a mass movement is based on
the worst element comprising it and in this regard CLASC is
challenged only by the party youth and student wings. As an
organized labor force CLASC has been a dismal failure (with the
exception of its campesino arm); its only impact and sole raison
d'etre up to this time has been as a political action instrument
with primary appeal to the working classes. It is unlikely that
CLASC, under Maspero leadership, will mellow as do parties when
they achieve the responsibility of government.
10. CLASC Has Maintained Posture of Independence. Despite its
"Christian" label, CLASC has consistently maintained that it is not
subservient to the Christian Democratic movement or any member
party. The statement cannot be disputed, for while CLASC is guilty
of most of the same aberrations as the least responsible of the CD
parties, it invariably commits its follies independently, (often,
in fact, setting an example that is emulated by the parties). But
while CLASC can defend its claim of independence, it is also true
that CLASC does not discourage the belief that it is the chosen
labor instrument of the Christian Democratic movement, although
this label has never been formally bestowed.
-
11. Closer Ties Between CLASC and CD Movement Appear Likely.
It appears likely that a more organic participation of CLASC in CD
affairs is in the offing. A Seminar was held in Montevideo from
11 23 April (sponsored by the Christian Democratic Formation
Institute -- IFEDEC) for officials of CLASC who are also officers
of Christian Democratic parties. The Seminar, called for the
specific purpose of arranging closer coordination between the CD
political movement and the Christian labor movement, resulted in
the signing of the "Carta de Montevideo" on 20 April. The Act
calls for formal representation of ODCA in both the Christian
labor organization and CD party labor departments. To this end,
a Coordinating Committee was formed the Comite Relacionador Y
Coordinador De Organizaciones Laborales Y Funcionales De Los
Partidos Democrata Cristianos. The Act appeals to the CD parties
