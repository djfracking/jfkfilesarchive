A.
Alberto LLERAS Camargo (201-102576) was born in Bogota,
3 July 1906. He left school at the age of seventeen to become a
journalist. He traveled to Argentina and lived in Buenos Aires for
three years (1926-29) writing for various Argentina periodicals.
His political career began upon his return to Colombia in 1929,
when he was appointed secretary of the Liberal Party (1930-33) and
received tremendous impetus under the aegis of Alfonso LOPEZ,
Liberal Party leader and former President of Colombia (1934-38 and
1942-45). Subsequently, LLERAS served in the National House of
Representatives (1931-34). When alfonso LOPEZ was inaugurated Pred-

General of the Presidency (1934-35), and later made him Minister of
Government from 1943 to 1945. The latter year he was made Minister
of Foreign Affairs, as well as "First Vice President of Colombia.
His public service culminated then in his accession to the Presi-
dency on the resignation of President LOPEZ in 1945. After dis-
charging the duties of Chief Executive for a year (1945-46), LLERAS
was elected Secretary General of the Pan American Union in 1947, a
post which he held until 1954. He then resigned and returned to
Colombia to accept the position of Rector (President) of the
University of The Andes (1955-56). Devoting himself once again to
politics, LLERAS began writing a column in the Liberal Daily El
Espectador. In his columns he strongly criticized the Rojas regime
(1953-57) and called for the return of constitutional government in
Colombia. In March 1956, he was elected President of the Liberal
Party and shortly thereafter (June 1956) travelled to Spain and had
conversations with Laureano GOMEZ, a leader of the Conservative
Party and former President of Colombia (1950-53). These two polit-
ical leaders signed a manifesto condemning the Rojas regime and
