extremely delicate, highly productive operations targeted against
the Communist Party of Costa Rica, and a political action opera-
tion of a most sensitive nature stemming from them. This latter
operation, focused as it was around the president of the country,
called for constant good judgment on how to pursue U.S. Govern-
ment interests with this highly sensitive and significant intelligence
at hand. (It was highlighted at the WH Division's Chiefs of Station
Conference held in February 1971 as a classic example of both the
collection and use of intelligence on the real "national interest"
level.)
Throughout these operations, Mr. Williamson handled him-
self very well, especially during the latter part of his tenure when
he was under considerable pressure as an almost inevitable conse-
quence of the impact of these operations. Ultimately, Mr.
Williamson's recall from Costa Rica was requested by the Costa
Rican Government. It should be stressed that this was a mark of
his operational success rather than the result of any operational
"flap" or miscue whatever. (The U. S. Ambassador was the
government's ultimate and preferred target but, for a variety of
reasons, it was desired by local authority to avoid that kind of a
confrontation with the U.S. Government, so Mr. Williamson was
selected as the next best target in the Embassy.) Publicity based
on false and self-serving leaks by the local government placed Mr.
Williamson under the most intense atrain in his final weeks. The

Comments of Reviewing Official;
I fully concur with the Rater's comments. I am
pleased that Mr. Flannery explained the circumstances
surrounding Mr. Williamson's recall from Costa Rica
so well. His tour was a fine piece of operational work
and in no way should it be tarnished by misinterpretation
or gossip.

fact that, under these general circumstances, he continued to
function normally, responding to numerous demands being made
on him by the situation and Headquarters, and set about paving
the way for his successor to take up the cudgel from the best
operational platform all this speaks for itself and certainly
underlines the fine quality of Mr. Williamson's professional and
personal characteristics.
-->
In the realm of normal activity, Mr. Williamson handled
his officers with both firmness and tact. He was a good manager,
ran a taut Station, and had cut back on several marginal operations,
streamlined others, and initiated some new ones. He writes well
and quickly, and he has exceptional fluency in Spanish. He moved
very well in the local community and, during his tenure, established
a wide range of contacts.
Mr. Williamson's relationship with the Ambassador was
excellent, and his wife was a great help to him in discharging his
representational duties and in developing contacts within the Costa
Rican community.
In sum, Mr. Williamson is a "pro" who turned in a strong
performance both before and after the chips were down.

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT
SUBJECT: Earl J. Williamson
1 April 1969 - 31 March 1970
Costa Rica has become progressively more important to
the Agency because of its very active Communist Party and
signs of the imminent arrival of the Soviets. In anticipation,
Mr. Williamson has geared his Station and honed his opera-
tions to cope with these problems. San Jose Station has some
of the more sophisticated and interesting operations in the
Central American area, and the Station is preparing to exploit
its assets to the maximum to meet the expected presence of the
Soviets.
Mr. Williamson is an old "pro" who has had a variety of
experiences in the intelligence field and who brings to his work
maturity garnished with enthusiasm and expertise.
He has done particularly well in guiding his subordinates
and extracting the maximum from them. His leadership is deft
but firm.
His relationship with the past ambassador, a difficult
person to deal with, who was not at first happy to have Mr.
Williamson, progressed to the point that he became a valuable
member of the Country Team and had the respect of the ambas-
sador. There is a new ambassador now and it is clear that
Mr. Williamson has gotten off to a very good start with him.

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT
SUBJECT: Earl J. Williamson
1 April 1968 - 31 March 1969
:
Mr. Williamson began his tour as Chief of Station, San
Jose, in July 1968. He was well prepared for the responsibilities
of the assignment, having served in two important stations as
Deputy Chief of Station, and as Deputy Chief, WH/COG.
At the outset of his assignment, Mr. Williamson was
confronted with an ambassador who had reservations on several
matters connected with the station, including problems con-
cerning the establishment of a "third country" radio operation.
Shortly thereafter Panamanian exile and guerrilla activities
placed an additional burden on the San Jose station and on rela-
tions with the ambassador. Mr. Williamson weathered these
initial rough spots well, keeping Agency interests protected.
In the seven months since his arrival in San Jose, Mr.
Williamson not only succeeded in overcoming the ambassador's
initial frostiness, but has mollified the ambassador's misgivings
on several potential items of conflict. Furthermore, he has won
a strong endorsement from the ambassador who has made it a
point to inform Headquarters officers that he is highly pleased
by the manner in which Mr. Williamson is handling his assign-
ment.

SUBJECT:
Memorandum in Liou of Fitness Report
Mr. Earl J. Williamson
-
1. Mr. Williamson is on the eve of his departure
as an overseas Chief of Station. This is a logical and
justified next step in his career development. Mr.
Williamson's responsibilities have been considorable
in recent years: DCOS in two important Stations;
Chief, FI and then Deputy Chief of WH/COG. It should
be pointed out that in the latter position he was
Acting Chief for long periods, performing admirably.
His new assignment indicates that the most senior
officers in the Division have recognized this.
1
2. Mr. Williamson is a professional intelligence
officer in the strictest sense of tho word. He is hard-
driving and tenacious%; despite his seniority he is on
any list of activists; he has the capability of gotting
things going, of getting the job done. He applies rigid
standards to his subordinates, but no less rigid than
those he applies to himself. He is cost-conscious to
an unusual degree. He is a fluent speaker of idiomatic
Spanish and can handle himsolf well in any miliou. If
Mr. Williamson is ever less than diplomatic it is whon
considering ersatz operational proposals or phoney
practices, neither of which he can tolerate.
3. There is no question that in his next assignment
Mr. Williamson will benefit from the social graces of his
charming wife. In his own private life Mr. Williamson
maintains numerous important contacts.

medium-sized installations, cince they must handle a peculiarly
wide range of problems. Included were case studies serving to
remind outgoing chiefs of various operational approaches and
techniques, but more time was devoted to policy, coordination,
management, reporting, and administrative responsibilities of
the Chief of Station, both within CIA and in the government at large,
at home and abroad,
The bulk of the course is given in lectures and question periods
conducted by officials responsible for the missions, functions, pro-
grams, and services discussed. A few key items of suggested read-
ing are included, and bibliographies of suggested reading tailored to
the individual's assignment are offered for those who want them.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT:
Memorandum in Lieu of Fitness Report ·
Mr. Earl J. Williamson
-
1. Mr. Williamson reported to WH/Cuban Operations
Group in February 1966 and immediately took over the
functions of Chief of the FI Branch. This Branch is
concerned with the conduct of positive intelligence
operations on a world-wide basis against the Cuban
target. A small proportion of these operations were
conducted directly from Headquarters (including the
direction of assets inside Cuba, a denied area). The
larger number of these operations was conducted through
third countries and supervision involved the provision
of staff support and guidance and extensive dealings
with other Divisions and, to a lesser degree, with
representatives of foreign liaison services. Mr.
Williamson took hold of these duties quickly and force-
fully and carried them out effectively and officiently.
In July 1966, Mr. Williamson was appointed
Deputy Chief of the Cuban Operations Group. In this
role his duties involved supervision of the totality
of the operational effort, including FI, CI, maritime
infiltrations, propaganda, political action, and
economic warfare. Again, Mr. Williamson undertook his
broader duties forcefully and efficiently. He has
shown qualities of leadership and good managerial skills
in dealing with personnel and organizational matters.
3.
3. During this period, Mr. Williamson has primari-
ly been interested in substantive operational matters.
He has carried out officiently and promptly those
staff functions which I have assigned to him, but I
detect a certain lack of interest in these, Probably
1
this reflects his most outstanding ability and con-
suming interest in the roal heart of our activities--
the production of intelligence and in the conduct of
actions against our targot. He has participated
personally in several operations and is one of the
relatively few senior officers who delights in handling
agents and making recruitments,

CORBET
4. Mr. Williamson is conscientious and economical
in the use of operational assets, manpower and money.
He is married to a charming young woman who is socially
active, entertains well and is a real asset in repre-
sentational activities.
5. Mr. Williamson's Spanish is fluent and
colloquial, and in combination with his extensive
understanding of Latin America and its people contri-
butes enormously to his effectiveness.

Subject is departing Spain for an assignment PCS Headquarters

the past three and one-half years he has headed up the Station's Cuban
operations, has acted as
has acted as a coordinator of Cuban activities in Western
Europe and has actively participated in operations in support of other
WE stations.
Starting completely from scratch, the Station was able, under
Subject's able direction, to develop extensive operations against the
priority Cuban target, including technical operations against the
installation, recruitment and defection of important officials, pene-
tration of commercial establishments, recruitment and training of
internal assets, bi-lateral operations with the local services, etc.
Subject is an officer of considerable energy and drive. He has
a knack of developing and exploiting interesting contacts and much of
the success of the Station's Cuban program was due to his intimate
connections in Cuban exile circles. Subject was also able to enlist
the support of the local services in connection with certain aspects.

'composed (in addition to himself) of four case officers, two reports
officers and a secretary. Although he may be considered a "tough"
supervisor in demanding the best of his subordinates, the record.
will show that he was able to build a very successful program.
During his tour at this Station, Subject made an important con-
tribution toward the achievement of high priority targets. He is in
every sense of the word an experienced, energetic and dedicated
officer.
Since Subject's activities in support of other WE stations
in the conduct of Cuban operations were under the direction of Head-
quarters, the rating box for this specific duty has been left blank
for completion by the appropriate Headquarters official.

MAY 19 3 13 PM :65
During the period under review Subject's activities in suppØrk-of
Cuban operations elsewhere in Europe and his responsibilities as Coordina-
tor of Cuban activities for Western Europe have kept him away from the
Madrid Station approximately one half of the twelve month period. Since
these activities were under the direction of Headquarters, and not this
Station, the rater does not feel qualified to comment on Subject's per-
formance of Specific Duties 2 and 3 and has therefore left those rating
boxes blank for completion by the appropriato Headquarters' official.
With respect to Specific Duty 1, supervision of Station's Cuban opera-
tions, Subject has applied himself aggressively and imaginatively to this
task and the rater feels that Station's Cuban operations have been main-
tained at a high level and have been an important contribution to KUBARK's
world-wide effort against this priority target. Obviously Subject's fre-
quent and prolonged absences from the Station have not permitted him to
give this task his undivided attention or the day-to-day continuity that
is so necessary and important.
In the conduct of the Station's Cuban operations Subject has direct
supervision of four operations officers, ono full time and one part time
reports officer, and a secretary. Subject is an efficient organizer and
supervisor. He thinks and writes clearly. Ho is fluent in Spanish, In
the conduct of the extensive Cuban operations he has shown himself to be

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL
I know subject and am thoroughly familiar with his work and performance.
I concur in this report with one exception, namely the rating given
subject for specific duty No. 6. Because of his travels which absented
him from the Station for one-half of the past year, subject perforce was
inadequately qualified to take charge of the station in the absence of
the COS. Specializing on Cuban operations entirely, he has but a
-limited knowledge of the station's other activities and considering only
the effectiveness of his performance of this duty, I could not rate him
higher than P. This is not a comment on his capability but rather an
evaluation of his effectiveness in performance of this particular duty.

on foreign language competence, if required for current position, Amplify or explain ratings given in Section 8 to provide best

During the period under review Subject's duties and activities have continued to be
concentrated on the Cuban target. Subject's performance of those duties has been
eminently satisfactory and have received the recognition and commendation of Head-
quarters. Subject is an all-round operations officer with considerable experience
and no significant weaknesses. His strengths are his aggressive approach to his
operational responsibilities, his sound judgment and his complete dedication to
duty. Due to: Subject's energy and imagination the Madrid Station has been able to
develop a highly effective and well-balanced program of Cuban operations. In ad-
dition Subject has spent a good part of his time in support of high level Cuban
operations outside of Spain, assignments which he has carried out with a high degree
of professionalism and success. In every sense Subject can be classified as a man
of action.
In the conduct of the Cuban operations Subject has direct supervision of three op-
erations officers, one reports officer, and one secretary. In addition he maintains
indirect supervision of a debriefing center, an intelligence processing shop and
all activities relating to the recruitment, training and dispatching of agents to the
target country. Subject maintains contact with high level liaison officers whose
cooperation and support are needed for a good part of our overall operations and the
excellent cooperation we have received from those officials attests to the skill of
Subject. Subject, of course, is fluent in Spanish. His drafting of cables and
dispatches is excellent. Subject hac at all times exhibited cost consciousness in
the planning and execution of his operational responsibilities. In a word Subject is
an excellent officer and a credit to the organization in every respect.

to run his own station and, in my opinion, it would be an injustice to him if he
is not assigned as chief of a medium sized station wher, his service

in improvement in the attitude and performance of the officer in question.
Subject is especially effective in his dealings with high level liaison officers
and the fact that our relations with the various security services are currently on a

Subjećt has devoted to this important activity. At the same time, subject has not

Station's performance in connection with all phases of this top priority activity, car-
ried out under Subject's supervision, has been the subject of commendatory conments from
Headquarters. In addition to direction the Station's own Cuban operations, Subject has
boen frequently called upon to support other WE Stations in connection with various
phases of their Cuban oporations, particularly in making both "warm" and "cold" ap-
proaches to high level diplomatic candidates for defection. These assignments have been
undertaken by Subject with much enthusiasm and a high degree of professionalism. As a
matter of fact, Subject was away from Madrid on these and similar missions for 120 days
during calendar year 1962.
In the conduct of the Cuban operations, Subject has direct supervision over four
officers and indirect supervision of the debriefing center, the intelligence processing
shop and all activities relating to the recruitment, training and dispatching of agents.
Through personal liaison with leading Spanish intelligence and security corvice of-
ficials, ho has been most successful in obtaining their cooperation in support of our
operations. In addition, Subject has expended much of his after-hours time to maintain-
ing contact with agents and persons of operational interest.
Subject is fluent in Spanish. He is an efficient organizer and supervisor and thinks
and writes clearly. In summary, he is an experienced, energetic and highly dedicated
officer. While he is well qualified to take over his owh Station, it is my hope, and

Wintson,
This officer, who is Deputy Chief of Station and also Chief of oporabe
-
directly supervises a sizeable number of personnel involved in joint oporab
with liaison and directs the operations in which they are engaged. In the com-
paratively short time he has been in this Station he has succeeded in making major
advances in our liaison relationship to the point where we can now accomplish
considerably more than before his arrival. He is energetic, imaginative, gets
things done, and works round the clock his off duty hours he employs mainly in
developing further his liaison and other operational relationships. Furthermore,
unlike some officers in liaison he is also most active developing independent
operations. As for his qualities as a deputy, suffice it to say that he is the best
deputy I have had in my entire career with this organization - a truly outstanding
officer, as reflected in the numerical ratings I have given him, whom I would be
glad to have with me any place I may be assigned.

MEMORANDUM FOR:
SUBJECT
Earl J. Williamson
: Foreign Divorce Decree
"
1901
1
1
"
1. The purpose of this memorandum is to bring certain information
to your attention which relates to the fact that your current spouse was a
party to the dissolution in Mexico of a former marriage.
2. Recently, the Office of General Counsel completed a study of the
validity of a Mexican divorce decree and potential problems arising from
such a divorce for JKLANCE employees concerned and JKLANCE. A
summary of CGC's study is attached,
3. You will note from the attachment that the employee whose cur-
rent marriage follows a Mexican divorce may be confronted with serious
problems affecting eligibility for payment of various government benefita
such as reimbursement of hospitalization expenses, survivorship benefita
and certain types of overseas allowances. My purpose in writing to you,
therefore, is to be sure you are made aware of and understand the serious -
ness of the problems which would arise in the event of a challenge to the
validity of the Mexican divorce and, consequently, to the validity of the
current marriage. This challenge could arise at any time and from a
number of sources.
4. JKLANCE has another interest stemming from Mexican divorces
and this is one of security, depending upon the employee's specific employ-
ment. In the event such a divorce is challenged, subsequent litigation and
attendant publicity become quite probable. It is, of course, in JKLANCE's
best interest that this sort of activity be avoided where possible.
5. Rocognising that there are various types of Mexican divorce, and
also that the various states in the United States have decided cases in different
ways depending on the type of Mexican divorce involved and its own case law.

TRAINING REPORT
MANAGERIAL GRID SEMINAR (50 hours)

Student
: Earl J. Williamson
Year of Birth: 1915
Grade
: 15
Office
: WH
Service Designation D
No. of Students
: 46
EOD Date : June 1952
COURSE OBJECTIVES AND METHOD
Course objectives are to aid participants to: learn the managerial theories
contained in the Grid; understand their personal managerial styles in Grid
terms; evaluate convictions about managerial values; develop team action
skills; increase candidness of communication; strengthen the use of critique for
problem-solving and learning; and acquire an appreciation of Organization Cul-
ture and Development.
In
The method of learning offers a challenge to all participants regardless of
level or experience. A Grid Seminar is not "taught" in the usual sense.
Grid teams, participants solve complex management problems. Objective solu-
tions are made available. Individual and team performance is repeatedly
assessed. Various measuring instruments are used to evaluate effectiveness.
Critique sessions assist each participant to understand how he might change
his own behavior to increase his problem-solving effectiveness. Thus managers
are not told the best way to manage, but they learn by convincing themselves.
About twenty to thirty hours of study are completed as prework, insights
gained are deepened and personalized during the intensive 50-hour Seminar.
ACHIEVEMENT RECORD
This is a certificate of attendance only. No attempt was made to evaluate

you may wish to discuss your personal situation with your attorney or a rep-
resentative of JKLANC E's Office of General ( ounsel. In the meantime,
however, JALANCE's position with respect to your situation is that it assumes
the validity of your current marriage, unless the earlier Mexican divorce
action and your current marriage are challenged. Should that challenge over
occur, it may be necessary for JKLANCI to determine that your eligibility
for benefits based on your current marriage must be suspended until such
time as the challenge is litigated or otherwise resolved. "pecial note should
be taken of the fact that such a challenge might arise after your death, possibly
resulting in the distribution of insurance proceeds and other death benefits to
other than your immediate family as constituted at your death and contrary to
your own intentions and wishes.
6. Please advise me of your plans and any actions takon in connection
with the above. If you have any questions on the substance of this memorandum
or its purpose, please do not hesitate to let me know.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Personnel

SUBJECT
:
Deputy Director for Plans
-
Request
: Mr. Earl J. Williamson
for Approval of Ten Days of
Additional Home Leave
REFERENCE
:
HR 20-30b(3)(b)(10)
1. The circumstances surrounding Mr. Earl-J,
Williamson's departure from San Jose, where he had
been Chief of Station, are described in the attached
memorandum. Because of the disruptive nature of his
PCS transfer to Washington, Mr. Williamson has requested
an additional ten days of home leave. As he is a State
Department integree, the Office of Finance, subject to
approval of his request, can offset the State disallowance
of his additional home leave and the charge to his annual
leave by adjusting Mr. Williamson's escrow leave account
as appropriate.
2. Due to the nature of his transfer, Mr. Williamson's
request for an additional ten days of home leave appears
to be warranted. In accordance with the provisions of
the referenced regulation, it is recommended that Mr.
Williamson's request for an additional ten days of home
leave be approved.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Home Leave Earl J. Williamson
-
1. The following are the circumstances concerning my
departure and home leave from San Jose, Costa Rica.
a.
My home leave and return for a second tour
to San Jose was approved by Chief, WH Division in
the summer of 1970 for January 1971.
b. In October 1970 home leave and return orders
were requested from State Department and physicals
were taken.
c. In December 1970 home leave and return orders
were received from the Department based on the itinerary
I had requested to be effective on or about 1 January
1971,
d. My departure scheduled for 3 January was
deferred by the Ambassador based on operational
considerations at the time.
On 8 January 1971 I was officially declared
PNG by the Conta Rican Government.

f. To give the public impression that my departure
was a routine transfer, the Department, the Agency, and
the GOCR agreed to the postponement of my departure
until 21 February 1971.
K. On 11 February 1971 1 received Department orders
based on my previously requested itinerary for home
leave and reassignment to Washington,
h. My home leave itinerary included five days annual
loavo in Mexico onroute and 25 days home leave reporting
for duty on 5 April. I actually arrived in D. C. on 23
March and was fully occupied until 5 April in locating
and renting a homo and getting my family settlod.
1. In accordance with Department regulations, I
have been credited with only 15 days home leave and the
additional 10 days have been charged to annual leave,
2. I submit that the circumstances of my departure from
San Jose wore unusual and beyond my responsibility or control.
The delay in departure definitely occurred because of opera-
tional requirements abroad which negated my original home
leave schedule. I would like to request the granting of an
exception to the 15 day home leave limitation to show my
return to duty as of 23 March (the date I arrived in D. C.)
rather than 5 April the date the Department has me returning
to duty,

Now that Earl Williamson has come and gone

felt the same way about it.

Notification of Designation as a inrticipant in
the Organisation Retirement and Disability System
Action: Advise Subject
REF: Book Dispatch 5096
1. Subject has been found to be qualified as a participant in the Organi-
sation Retirement and Disability system and has been so designated ellective
24 October 1965.
2. Although such designation under present statutes in viewed favorably
by most persons, the regulation governtag this retirement system gives the
individual the right to appeal such a deterraization if he deems the designa-
tion adverse to his best interests. In order that this technical requirement
may be satisfied, subject should be notified promptly of his designation and
of his right to appeal. Any questions he may have should be answered in
accordance with information contained in Boos Dispatch 5096 or referred to
Headquarters. An appeal with reasons therefore must be received in Head-
quarters within 60 days of the date of this dispatch or acceptance of desig-
nation will be assumed,
3. we believe that the benefits of the ɩrganisation retirement system
are superior to the benefits of the Civil service retirement system. How-
ever, there are a few situations in which an employes at the time of retire.
ment may have so many years of service (almost 37) that he would receive
a/higher annuity under the Civil service system, because of this, the policy
decision has boẩn made that a participant in the Organization system who
would receive a higher anmality under the Civil service system may, not later
than one year prior to his retiremon!, apply to be removed from our system
and transferred to the Civil bervice system. Thus, subject should not antici-
pate this contingenty as a factor in decidia, whether be regards his designa.
tion as a participant-adverse to his best interente.

Request of Earl J.. Williamson, GS-15, to
Remain in the Employment of CIA Following
Marriage to an Alien

1.
This memorandum submits a recommendation for your approval:
this recommendation is contained in paragraph 7.
2. Mr. Earl J. Williamson, a GS-15 Operations Officer, has
requested permission to remain in the employ of CIA as a Staff
Employee following his marriage to Miss Virginia J. Lobo, a 26 year
old Cuban citizen living in Spain. The marriage is scheduled to
take place in October 1965.
3. Mr. Williamson, 50 years old, attended Loyola University in
1947-48 and Berlitz School of Languages in 1948. Prior to joining
CIA, Mr. Williamson served with the U.S. Army (1942-40) achieving the
rank of 1st Lieutenant in CIC. Subsequently, he was Chief, Civil
Intelligence Branch in the Panama Canal Government (1949-52).
Mr. Williamson entered on duty with CIA in June 1952 as a GS-12
Operations Officer with WH Division. In January 1953 he was appointed
DCOB, Havana, remaining in this position until January 1959 when he
was reassigned to Headquarters. In August 1960 Mr. Williamson was
assigned to Madrid and in 1963 was appointed DCOS, Madrid, which is
the position he presently occupies.
4. The COS, Madrid, Mr. James A. Noel, has known Miss Lobo for
over three years. He says she is a most attractive young lady who is
a member of a distinguished and respected Cuban family. She is well
educated, fluent (bi-lingual) in English, intelligent, cultured, and
gracious. He has found her to be discreet at all times.

who has spared no effort to expand and improve the Agency's coverage
in his area of assignment. WE Division and WH Division, where
Mr. Williamson will be reassigned, foresee no difficulty, siverse
effect in future usefulness or mobility as a result of this marriage.
6. I have reviewed Mr. Williamson's employment record and
consider him an able and valuable member of the Clandestine Services.
He has consistently performed his duties well, has strong to out-
standing Fitness Reports, and is a definite asset to the Agency. I
believe that the proposed marriage will not detract from his long
term use by the Clandestine Services.
7. In view of the above consideration, I recommend that
Mr. Williamson be continued in Staff Employment Status following
his proposed marriage.

application for permission to marry an alien is

lady and is a member of a distinguished and respected Cuban family. She is
woll-oducated, fluent (bi-lingual) in English, intelligent, cultured and
gracious. I have found her at all times to be discreet. There is no question
whatsoever in my mind that she will be a most loyal Amorican citisen and a

has demonstrated outstanding talents in management of personnel and their
activities, developing relationships with liaison in operations both joint

the best deputy I have had in my PENS career and altogether an outstanding

Mr. Earl J. Williamson
!
1. Since October 1960, Mr. Williamson has served as Deputy Chief of the
Madrid Station, and during an extended period of this time, he was Acting Chief
of Station. His performance has been outstanding. Not only has he assisted his
Chief in the management of the Station, but simultaneously managed to reinvigorate
our liaison program in Spain, which was the particular area of responsibility
originally assigned to him. His service has been noteworthy not only for his vigor
in initiating new activities but also for his balanced, yat energetic, cutting away
of deadwood, useless procedures and purposeless activity.
20 In recent months, in part on his own initiative, and later under forved
draft at Headquarters direction, Mr. Williamson has been instrumantal in mounting
an active operational program targeted against Cuba. Dus almost entirely to the
imagination, energy, and effort which he has applied, this program has already had
considerable success in the acquisition of intelligence and the recruitment of
agents, and promises to be even more productive in the future.
3. Mr. Williamson's activity since his assignment to Madrid is clearly of
outstanding caliber and it is noteworthy that the present Chief of Station as well
as the preceding Chief of Station have both, on the record, rated him as exceptionally
able, energetic, and mature. Mr. Williamson has been in his current grade since
December 1956. In view of the considered judgment concerning the value of his
performance in Spain, his good administrative qualities, his obvious maturity, energy,
judgment and experience, it is strongly recommended that Hr. Williamson be promoted
to grade 05-15..

The performance of the Chief CAS continues to be very fine. He is
highly experienced and capable both in his job and in this geographic
area. I find him most cooperative, as does, I am sure, the Country
Team as a whole. He is dependable, his judgment is good, he speaks
to the point and his advice is sound. In addition to his thorough
professional competence, both he and his wife are active and
effective socially.

the problems of repre•

enlist support for our operations.
During the past year, the the of supervising the
M./Chile Branch has been a most challenging one. Chilc
has become a knotty foreign policy problem, and is the
subject of continuous and extensive discussions between
the Agency, the State Department, and other components
of the Government, while receiving the attention of the
nost senior policy makers. Requirements from many
directions have required constant pressure to respond
with ideas, methods, procedures and the subsequent
position papers. Through it all Mr. Williamson has
maintained a sense of balance and professionalism
which permits a proper focus on the crisis of the moment.
We have been fortunate in having an officer of Mr.
Willicuson's caliber in this position during such a
difficult period.
In recognition of Mr. Willemson's demonstrated
continuous superior performance as a senior intelligence
officer, which has contributed to the accomplishment of
the mission of the Agency, it is recommended that he be
awarded the Certificate of Distinction.

Dear Earl:
You have just completed, at my direction, seven weeks
of full-time service on the GS-13 Clandestine Service
Personnel Evaluation Board. I know that this work has been
particularly demanding. Your participation and diligent
application of your professional experience have been
decisive factors in the successful accomplishment of the
Board's missions.
In the course of this assignment you have become
thoroughly familiar with the use and interpretation of per-
sonnel files and personnel practices of the Clandestine
Service. Having reviewed and analyzed the files of one
hundred or more CS officers, you have had to make judgments
and recommendations concerning their relative-ranking and
their qualifications for promotion, for training required
to overcome a deficiency or enhance career effectiveness,
for changes of assignment to further career development and
for Quality Step Increases to recognize outstanding perform-
ance. In so doing, you have carefully studied the career
development of a large number of officers in all components
of the CS, both as individuals and in relationship to each
other in terms of morit and value to the Clandestine Service.
You have become familiar with a broad spectrum of
personnel and administrative problems on a practical working
level and have acquired a knowledge of personnel management
which will better equip you to handle supervisory positions
which require personnel reporting and career development of
subordinates. The committee format of the panels has also
deepened your understanding of the conference approach to
management problems.
