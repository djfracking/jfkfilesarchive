ORDINARILY REF A TYPE OF PROPOSAL WOULD BE APPEALING, J.F
TEX HOWEVER, FOR
XIXXXIX.
FOLLOWING REASONS BELIEVE AMCHALK-5 OPERATION NOT THE PROPER VEHICLE.
A. POSSIBILITY OF DGI REVENGE AGAINST AMCHALK-5, HIS FAMILY,
AND FRIENDS BOTH IN CUBA AND US.
B.
POSSIBILITY THAT OPERATION WOULD JEOPARDIZE ANY FUTURE
CONTACT BETWEEN RVROCK AND OFFICIAL CUBANS ABROAD, AS CUBANS NATURALLY
WOULD REGARD ALL FUTURE CONTACT AS POSSIBLE PROVOCATIONS.
C. CUBANS WOULD PROBABLY MAKE PUBLIC PROTEST TO CANADIAN
GOV SAYING ALL WAS RVROCK PLOT TO DAMAGE CUBAN-CANADIAN RELATIONS.
COULD FURTHER MENTION THIS SECOND CASE, FIRST BEING LISAGA CASE IN WHICH
CUBANS MAY SAY WE ALSO TRIED TO DAMAGE CUBAN-MEXICAN RELATIONS.
CUBA MIGHT REINFORCE ITS CASE BY MENTIONING AMCHALK-5'S TRUE NAME
AND WHAT CUBAN GOVERNMENT KNOWS OF HIS ACTIVITIES ON BEHALF
RVROCK.

WH Comment: Ref A says that Hqs desiresthat Nebecker initiate contact
with AMCHALK-5 and that AMCHALK-5 should not make
meeting with DGI without surveillance by SMABOVE,
Ref B says that NOLTHAM, Ottawa Station Officer, will .
contact AMCHALK-5 at his hotel in Montreal to try delay
operation. It adds that NOLTHAM and NEBECKER (DCOS
WH/Miami) will consult with SMABOVE to assure coverage
of meeting. Ref C requests no contact between NOLTHAM
and AMCHALK-5 for fear that operation would be exposed
to DGI. Ref D requests that operation proceed only if
protective coverage can be given to AMCHALK-5-DGI
meeting and that NEBECKER initiate contact with AMCHALK-5
upon arrival Montreal.

The DGI's first letter to A/S in 1907
carried an implied threat to these relative The writer
does not know what happened to the relatives after ANCHAIK/5
double crossed the DUI in the 1967 mesting.
But they
are surely going to be in jeopardy again if they aro
there, because the DGI, in the criteria o inion, will
eventually discover this second double cross.
3. Furthermore, the DGI initiated an operation to
assassinato ACHALK/1 who participated in Bolivia in the
GUEVARA roll-up. The DGI just might consider ASK/5
as treat an enery as AMCHATK/1.
4. It is my recollection than when C and FIMO,
the two DGI cfficers, not ACHIK/5 in Madrid, they were
armed; marever they clearly displayed their holsters to
AMCHALK/5.

EAGER TO UNDERTAKE EFFORT TO EITHER (A) MAKE SELF ATTRACTIVE
TO DGI FOR DOUBLE AGENT PURPOSES OR (B) PARTICIPATE IN POS-

DEPENDENT UPON HOW MEETINGS GO IN MONTREAL.
2. FOLLOWING IS EXPLANATION WHICH AMCHALK-5 WILL PROVIDE
DGI OFFICER AS EXCUSE FOR REINITIATION OF CONTACT, I.E. THAT
HE TOTALLY DISILLUSIONED WITH ACTIONS OF U.S. GOVERNMENT VIS-
A-VIS CUBA, THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, AS IS WELL KNOWN IN THE
MIAMI AREA, HAS TERMINATED ALL OF ITS MILITANT ACTION CAPABILITY
AGAINST CUBA, AND THAT HE HIMSELF HAS BEEN DEFINITIVELY TERMI-
NATED. THIS WILL BE MOST PLAUSIBLE TO DGI SINCE THEY UNDOUBT-
EDLY AWARE OF TALK IN EXILE COMMUNITY OF MASS TERMINATIONS.
AMCHALK-5 WILL THEN EXPLAIN THAT SINCE THE U.S. GOVERNMENT
CANNOT BE COUNTED ON FOR ANYTHING HE HAS TAKEN IT UPON HIMSELF

TO ATTEMPI BECAUSE OF REASONS OF CONSCIENCE TO HELP GET RELEASED
HIS COLLEAGUES AND FRIENDS WHO ARE CURRENTLY IN PRISON IN CUBA
AND THAT HE IS WILLING TO COOPERATE WITHIN LIMITS TO DO THIS
AND THUS HE HAS REQUESTED DISCUSSIONS WITH DGI. THIS IS A
MOST PLAUSIBLE STORY SINCE DISILLUSIONMENT IS COMMON
AMONG FORMER MILITANT EMPLOYEES OF RVROCK. WE PRESUME THAT
THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS WILL BE THAT THE DGI OFFICER MEETING
AMCHALK-5 WILL THEN CONVEY THIS MESSAGE TO HIS HEADQUARTERS.
, HOWEVER, IN VIEW OF DGI PAST RELATIONS WITH AMCHALK-5, IT IS
POSSIBLE THAT THEY WILL BE PREPARED TO CONCRETELY TASK HIM
AND HE MAY HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS WHILE IN MONTREAL, THUS
BELIEVE IT IMPORTANT THAT A WH/MIAMI OFFICER BE PRESENT IN
MONTREAL TO COVER THIS CONTINGENCY.
3. AMCHALK-5 HAS CONFIRMED TO HAVANA MONTREAL MEETING
AND HAS BEEN INSTRUCTED TO MAKE RESERVATIONS FOR TRAVEL TO
MONTREAL AND RESERVATIONS AT HOTEL DESIGNATED BY DGI. THIS
WILL UNDOUBTEDLY TRIGGER PREPARATION ON PART DGI FOR MEETING
WITH AMCHALK-5. TRAVEL WILL BE BY AIR CANADA OR TRAIN.

Attached for the information of addressees are copies
of a letter purportedly written by Serafin Pineiro Losada
to Argelio Martinez del Toro, former mayor of Matangas
now resident in Miami. The original letter has been
returned to AMCHALK-5. Most of the letter soons devoted
to complaint that Serafin has been unjustly accused of
being a member of the G-3. Of interest is the writer's
reference to the death of "Pepito" (probably Jose Pineiro
Losada, 201-735948) some three years ago.

8. ANCHALK-5 may also be terminated within this
fiscal year. He has managed to develop a successful,
full-time business and is only slightly involved in
operational activity. We are holding off on his termination
because of the potentially interesting operational situation
discussed in paragraph 12 of reference. ARCHALK-5 thinks
the black marketeers referred to may be on the verge of
another trip to Miami. It might be interesting from the
JMROD standpoint to "piggyback" that channel and send in
an incriminating packago to a J10 target. ARCHALK-5
as the source of the package is already well identified
through the ANGHOST operation as affiliated with RVROCK.
There are the two possibilities that the couriers themselves
would open the package, inspect the contents and turn the
whole package over to the DSE or that they would deliver
it unopened to the target. In the latter case the target
might oither turn it over to the DSE, destroy it, or make
use of the contents for his own benefit. Content of the
package would of course have to be tailored to the target
but it might purport to be an agent re-supply cache.
Many possible avenues would have to be explored; for the
moment vo would appreciate consideration of the proposal
by the Desk and JMROD staff. One of the first items to
be resolved is whether or not there is an inherent "blow
back" feature of the situation which could cause too much
embarrassment if exposed to press play. Specifically,
is there a case for an allegation that RVROCK was using
the international organization with which the "couriers"
are affiliated for "subversive" purposes? The answer to
that question probably lies somewhere in between what the
contents of the package consists of and to what longths
the Cubans would be willing to go to "burn" the "loyal
conradə” couriers.

Attached is a letter received from Pan American
World Airways in response to one written by AMCHALK-5
in an unsuccessful attempt to secure a refund on the
Although Pan
unused portion of an airline ticket.
American avers that the ticket has no value the fact
remains that a person could use it to fly from Miami
to New York during the period of validity (expiring
20 April 1969). The Station will hold the ticket until
expiration in event that an opportunity arises where it
can be used by an individual performing official travel.

8. Miguel Angel DIAZ Isalque: I showed P the letter from DIAZ to the
box;
PO Box 982 Coral Gables box; F -aid he did not know that adiress and had no
idea how DIAZ might have got it. I told P it was a sensitive adress which we
did not want to have blown, asked him to contact DIAZ, ostensibly because
KALBING (who long ago was having P prime DIAZ for a trip to Madrid, which
1
never came off) had sent regards and an explanation of why the "adrid thing
fell thru) P is to make no mention of the Coral Gables address or the letter,
vili
but assuming DIAZ bring it up, to try to discover how DIAZ got that address,
1
while also discovering what it is DIAZ had in mind when he wrote the letter.
P thinks he baa DIAZ' phone number, if necessary can use the ploy of having
s^en DIAZ' TV ad for his furniture store.>

1. THROUGH QUEYE SURVEILLANCE IT WAS DETERMINED ON
16 OCTOBER THAT AMWOLF/1 LEFT THE CONSULATE ALONE AND WENT TO HIS
APARTMENT. ON THE BASIS OF THIS ALERT, POSITIONED AMCHALK/5
NEAR GARAGE WHERE AMWOLF/1 PARKS HIS CAR.
2. AT 1656 HOURS 16 OCTOBER WHEN AMWOLF/I LEFT THE GARAGE,
AMCHALY/5 WAS ABLE TO STOP HIM HALF A BLOCK FROM HIS APARTMENT
AND CARRIED ON A SIX MINUTE CONVERSATION. INITIALLY AMWOLF/I
AT FIRST
WAS COLD, VISUALLY UPSET BUT LATER BECAME JOVIAL.
INSISTED THAT AMCHALK/5 COME TO THE CONSULATE OR CALL HIM TO
SET UP MEETING. HOWEVER, AMCHALK/5 INSISTED THEY TALK THEN
AND AMWOLF/1 AGREED. AFTER AMCHALK/5 MADE THE PITCH, AMWOLF/I
REACTED BY SAYING "THESE JOHNIES' HAVE EVERYTHING AND NOW THEY
REALLY STEPPED ON ME". AMWOLF/1 ENDED THE CONVERSATION BY
AGAIN AKSING AMCHALK/5 TO COME TO CONSULATE OR CALL HIM SO THEY
COULD HAVE ANOTHER TALK. AMWOLF/1 RETURNED TO THE CAR WHERE HIS
WIFE WAS WAITING AND STARTED THE MOTOR AND THEN STOPPED AGAIN AND
GOT OUT. HE THEN HAD AMCHALK/5 COME OVER AND INTRODUCED HIS
SECRET

3. AMCHALK/5 COMMENTED TO CASE OFFICER THAT HE DID NOT THINK
AMWOLF/I WOULD CHANGE HIS POSITION NOW. AMCHALK/5 BELIEVES WE SHOULD
WAIT A FEW DAYS BEFORE ATTEMPTING ANOTHER CONTACT EITHER BY ANOTHER

TELEPHONE CALL PRODUCES A CONTINUED NEGATIVE REACTION, WOULD NOT PROCEED
WITH SECOND MEETING UNLESS HQS DESIRES CONTRARY. BELIEVE WE

1. Attached please find the following (we have marked
each in accordance with our lettering):
A. Two plugs which were actually cut off of the
REDTOP air-conditioners by José CASTAGNA. You will
note that one of these plugs is fused together to a
local adaptor. This adaptor is the type utilized
by the local FJSTEALERS on those air-conditioners
_ which still have original plugs.
B. A locally produced plug which is utilized
by the FJSTEALERS to replace the original plugs
(A above). This locally produced plug (B) was
actually taken by AMSTALK-1 from José CASTAGNA's
workshop.
c. A locally produced plug which, though slightly

5 October 1972
MEMORANDUM FORL Record
SUBJECT
TIME AND PLACE:
: Heeting with AMCHALK-5 ·
Miami, 3 and 4 OCTOBER
>
:
1. I met AMCHALK-5 at 1430 hours at the Rusty Pelican
Restuarant. I told him we would like to have him travel
immediatoly in order to arrive in Madrid by 9 October. AMCHALK-5
said he could make it with no problem. He wasn't sure his wife
would be able to go on such short notice, but that didn't matter.
I briefed him on the contact arrangements sent from Madrid and
described WIBALDA to him. I told him WIBALDA'S name is "ROBERTO."
AMCHALK-5 said he would make the 0330 hours contact on 10 October,
but of course if something goes wrong that he will go to all
the alternate meetings. He will be wearing a white sports
jacket, white shirt, blue tie, blue slacks and black shoes.
2. I told AMCHALK-5 that WIBALDA would have the letter
for AMGHOST-1 for him to take to the meeting, and I told him
again not to use the letter unless his recruitment pitch had
no results. If he does pass the letter, I suggested that he
flex it to prove to AMWOLF-1 that it does not contain a bomb.
ves
3. I told AMCHALK-5 that it looked good for a surprige
contact with AMWOLF-1 on 10 October and because he would be
going to lunch with a woman not connected with his office.
AMCHALK-5 was pleased to hear this because he feels he must
make the contact unannounced for it to be effective. He said
that if the October 10 contact was missed, there would probably
be another luncheon the following week. AMCHALK-5 is willing
to stay in Madrid as long as necessary. ,
1
4.
AMCHALK-5 was sorry to hear that I won't be going to
Madrid because he wants to be sure that he is given as much
flexibility as possible, and not forced to handle the approach
in a manner that he would not be comfortable with. I told him
fit:

IN THIS OP, I.E., ONE FOR UNILATERAL AND LESSER ONE AS SOP FOR
BIOGENESIS. SINCE CASTAGNA WOULD BE OBVIOUS SOURCE OF INSTALLATION,
COMPROMISE OF ONE (PROBABLY LESSER DEVICE) WOULD LIKELY LEAD TO COM-
PROMISE OF OTHER. THEREFORE, SUGGEST WE STICK TO YOUR ORIGINAL PLAN
OF NOT REVEALING TRUE SITUATION TO BIOGENESIS RE INSTALLATION, AND
PLAN FOR UNILATERAL OP.
2. RE PARA FOUR HQS CANNOT MEET TWO WEEK TIMETABLE. FEASI-
BILITY STUDY WILL TAKE ABOUT ONE WEEK AFTER RECEIPT PLUGS AND
PREFABBING WILL TAKE AT LEAST THIRTY DAYS AFTER THAT. PLS NOTE WE
CANNOT EVEN GUARANTEE THAT PLUGS ARE ADAPTABLE TO AUDIO DEVICE.

that WIBALDA understood the situation, and that I was sure it
would all go well. AMCHALK-5 assured me that he has no inton-
tion of letting himself get into a physically dangerous situation
during the contact.
5.
If the contact is made next wook, AMCHALK-5 will be
back before the PACHANKIS is. I said we would want to debrief
him in Miami and that either I would see him or PACHANKIS would.
I said that if PACHANKIS talks to him, he can tell PACHANKIS tho
complete details of the operation unless I phoned him otherwise.
8. We arranged to meet again at 1900 hours when AMCHALK-5
would have his itinerary, and I could pass him the money he needed.
AMCHALK-5 doesn't want to be paid for this job, but I insisted
again that we would pay all his expenses, and I told him to save
his hotel bill and other receipts. We met at 1900 hours at the
Vizcaya bar and then drove around in AMCHALK-5's car. I passed
him $1,500 for which he signed a receipt. AMCHALK-5 had gotten
reservations and will leave Miami for New York on 7 October and
the fly to Lisbon that same night. He will spend 8 and 9 October
in Lisbon where he will rent a car and drive to Madrid, arriving
in the evening on 9. October. He has reservations in the Agumar
Hotel for 9 October, and he will make the first contact at 0930

he could offer as an inducement for either recruitment in place or
defection.

PERTINENT INFORMATION
Subsequent to the completion of the Attachment (SPR on Subject),
we learned from AMSTALK that SHPILEV, in a recent transaction with a
local service contact, was observed to add fifteen thousand pesos to
the bill. The contact receipted for the total amount, and SHPILEV then
returned five of the extra fifteen thousand pesos to him.
This type
of activity on SHPILEV's part appears to open up interesting operationa
possibilities. We plan to watch the situation carefully and will
advise you.

Thomas P. Keogh,
Proposal to Continue Attempt to Establish
Channel/Dialogue with ANGHOST-1 (201-810126)
1. As a follow-up beasure to our attempt to establish
a chennel to ANGHOST-1 by using ARCHD-2 on 10 August in
Montreal, I propose that we establich an operation with the
Same end; on this occasion, however, I propose that at this
stage we use AWOLF-1 as our secure channel to ANGHOST-1,
2, The dramatis
(a) ANCHALK-5 (301-307287
i
me in the ration are:
reliable, cose who
has been involved with and who knoGHT-1; and (b)
AMWOLF-1, Deputy Chief of Center, Cuban Intelligence
Services (CUYS), Madrid,
3. Timing of thin operation would be for that period
in September in which ACHALK-5 visits lurope,
4. The place for the meeting between AMCHALK-S and
ARAO2 would be in Madrid, Spain, at a place mutually convenient
to both. The meeting would be established either by telephone
or by personal contact.
S. The purpose of this operation is to establish a
channel of communications/dialogue with ANGHOST-1.

This operation involves ANCHALK-5's passing of a
sealed envelope with a message in it for 'OLF-1's unopened
transmittal to AMGHOST-1, ALCHALK-S's instructions would bo
to pass the sealed and unopened comunication to AMCLF-1.
AMCHALK-5 would then tell LF-1 that the message must be
transmitted directly without tampering or being opened to
AMGHOST-1. AMCHALK-5 would add that HO-1 is waiting
for this communication. (FYI: Director 148293, Jared
19 June 1971, paragraph 2 noted 'that A'INCLF-1 was contact

7. The message to AMCHALK-5 follows:
M.
We arranged to meet "PUSHKIN" recently but
you apparently called the meeting off. We can
understand your hesitancy to meet with us in that
place and at that time. We do, however, wish to
meet with you anytime, any place of mutual agree-
ment via any secure channel of your personal
confidence. As you can see, in this instance,
we have selected an officer whose loyalty to
you is unquestioned. We intended to tell
"PUSHKIN" of possible pitfalls in your path.
We still wish you to know of these dangers.
We realize that you are a true revolutionary
in every sense of the word. We have no
quarrel with you as a true revolutionary nor
with the system that has established itself
over the years. We will not countenance nor
do we believe that you will countenance continued
foreign intervention in your system wherein
lies the major danger to your futre. We would
also like to make you an offer which would be
difficult for you to refuse. To contact one
of our reliable officers concerning this
opening of a two-way channel of communications,
contact or have your selected man contact DIAZ
in which you showed some interest in 1967 and
he will then contact us. He will then relay
the time and meeting date to us, and we will
then open our dialogue using only trusted
personnel.

Greetings,
L.
!
8. I believe that our chances for success in this
operation are reasonably good for the following reasons:
(a) ANCHALK-5 is sufficiently courageous to meet AMWOLF-1
in the Cuban Ambassador's office in Madrid, if necessary; .
(b) AMWOLF-1 is a trusted colleague and follower of
AMGHOST-1. For this reason and in the belief that AMGHOST-1
was awaiting the message, he would find a way to deliver the
message unopened to AMGHOST-1; (c) AMGHOST-1 from all
available reporting, background material, SI traffic, we have
reason to believe that AMGHOST-1 is not held in the confidence
of the Soviets nor does he respect their presence in Cuba,
a presence which can only be interpreted as promising
difficulties for AMGHOST-1; and (d) Bona fides for the
originator are contained in a copy of a letter from AMGHOST - 2
to her relatives which she signs with the name "PUSHKIN."

It is clear from AMBEDEW-1 that the DGI

B. UFGA-29702, 12 March 1968
1. AMCHALK-5 was advised on 17 October 1969 that his
services with RVROCK had not been in sufficient demand to
Justify his retention on the payroll beyond 30 November 1969.
Accordingly, on 31 October 1969 AMCHALK-5 executed a termination
secrecy oath and quitclaim which are forwarded as separate
cover attachments hereto. The agent was paid his salary
through 30 November plus a bonus equivalent to one month's
salary.
2.
During the afternoon of 31 October 1969 and following
the meeting that morning with AMCHALK-5 which was to have been
the final meeting; AMCHALK-5 initiated contact with writer and
advised that he had, upon returning to his office from the
morning meeting, received a letter from Cuba. This letter was
in response to one which he had sent to an old accommodation
address. Reference A and subsequent correspondence describe
the letter received by AMCHALK-5 and developments which followed.
Although AMCHALK-5 was reimbursed for cost of his transportation
to Canada and was paid per diem for the duration of his travel,
he has collaborated with the Station since 30 November 1969
on a voluntary basis without compensation.

OFFICER NOLTHAM MET WITH SMABOVE OFFICERS.DON BATSTONE AND
NORMAN CYR OF THE MONTREAL COUNTER-SUBVERSIVE SECTION.
THE PURPOSE OF THE MEETING ARRANGED BY HOLTHAM WAS TO BRIEF
SMABOVE ON THE AMCHALK-5 OPERATION, DISCUSS THE CUBAN
PROBLEM AS IT RELATED TO CANADA AND TO GENERAL ACQUAINT
SMASOVE WITH WH/MIAMI INTERECTS. PRIOR TO MESTING WITH

SMADOVE FOR THE CUBAN TARGET.

OTTAWA STATION HELPED IN ESTABLISHING A FREE AND EAZY
DISCUSSION. NEBECKER FULLY REVIETEL THE ANCHALK-5 CASE
AND ALSO THE GENERAL PROBLEM OF WORKING AGAINST THE
CUBAN TARGET 'EMPHASIZING OUR INTEREST IN INCREASE. OPLHA-

WITH THE CUPAN TARGET. HE TOOK NOLTHAK AND HEBECKER ON A
TOUR OF CUBAN INSTALLATION SITES AND THE AREA WHICH ARROZ
HAD EXPLORED IN PREPARATION FOR HIS MITING WITH AMCHALK-9.
HE LATER EXHIBITED A HIGH DEGREE OF FRIENDLINĚCO AND TISK
