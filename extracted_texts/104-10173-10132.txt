MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: E. Howard Hunt--Madrid Assignment
22 February 1974
IG File !! Tub 38
"
1. On 22 February 1974, Mr. Frederick N. Evans
and the undersigned interviewed Mr. Edward Ryan,
Chief, Staff D, Deputy Director for Operations, on
the subject of Mr. E. Howard Hunt. During the period
of Mr. Hunt's assignment as a Contract A agent
to Madrid between July 1965 and September 1966, Mr.
Ryan had been the Deputy Chief of the Western European
Division, Deputy Director for Plans. The purpose of
the interview was to determine if Mr. Ryan had any
information bearing on the matter of the operational
assignment of Mr. Hunt during this period.
2. Mr. Ryan stated that the assignment of Mr.
Hunt both to the European Division and to Madrid was
handled without benefit of the routine processing
procedures through the Western European Division.
Mr. Hunt's assignment was coordinated and directed
by Mr. Thomas Karamessines, the Assistant Deputy Director
for Plans. With regard to operational duties, Mr. Ryan
was unaware of any specific project or target for Mr.
Hunt. Mr. Ryan made the specific obscrvation that if
Mr. Hunt produced positive intelligence on the Iberian
target during this period the officials responsible
for this effort within the Western European Division
were totally unaware of it.
.3. Mr. Ryan stated that most of his knowledge of
Mr. Hunt's activity and the nature of his assignment
during this period came more through hearsay than
direct official knowledge. For example, he cited the
comment made by a mutual acquaintance of his and Mr.
Hunt's to the effect that Mr. Hunt stated that while
in Madrid he was going to "play golf and write books."
Mr. Ryan was asked specifically whether or not he was

sponded that he was personally not aware of any such
arrangement. He added as an expression of personal
opinion that Mr. Hunt had no operational function and
was simply granted the opportunity to write books for
his own personal gain at Government expense during this
period.

20 December 1973
1. I phoned Paul Burns, Special Assistant to the DDO, and
said that we had some leads that could be followed by whoever has
the action in the DDO in tracking down Hunt's activities during the
fall of 1964, when he was alleged to have been engaged in surveillance
activities of Barry Goldwater.
2. I said that our files showed Hunt was in DO Division (Burns
was not familiar with that title, but recognized it as the predecessor
of FR Division) and in August 1964 was assigned to the Washington
field office. I suggested that Stan Gaines, who was Deputy Division
Chief of DO Division and now DCOS Bonn, might be in a position to
give a few groups on what Hunt was supposed to be doing then. I
suggested that he be queried by cable. Burns said Gaines is staying
on under contract for a while, so would continue to be available.
1
13. I said that Fig Coleman was on the Iberian desk when the
Hunt assignment to Madrid was brought up in 1964 and when Hunt
went to the field in 1965. He could give the background on the assign-
ment, which seems to have been through Karamessines at Helms"
direction. His recollection would give leads. I told him that Coleman
became COS Madrid later, after Hunt left Spain, and could provide
information on what Hunt did not do for the Agency during that period.
I suggested that both Helms and Karamessines should be queried.
I gave as a possible press treatment that Hunt was engaged in
domestic operations (something Senator Baker is pursuing) and that
his assignment to Spain after the clection could be presented as giving
him time to cool off. I thought we had to pursue the matter to be
sure we know the facts.
4. I asked Burns to be sure that we are on information distribution
of cables to the field on this, given our assigned responsibility for
keeping files on Watergate. He said we are on the PLMHPLANK for
messages to Helms. He would advise the action officer. I said we are
available for any help we can give.

SUBJECT: Conversation with Sam Halpern
16 File 10, Tale 3
22 February 1974
1. I met with Sam Halpern for about 20 minutes this morning
in GG10, where he is cleaning up some details before he goes to
his new assignment as DC/DCD. I told him generally about our
attempt to reconstruct Howard Hunt's assignments and financial
transactions, and asked him particularly for recollections he may
have of Hunt's assignment in Spain in mid-1965 to the fall of 1966.
"
2. Halpern said that he has no recollection about such an
assignment. In June 1965 he moved from WH Division with Des
FitzGerald when he became the DD/P. At about that time
Halpern's father died and he was in New York for the funeral
and ten days of religious observations following that. He was back
in mid-June. and in and out from then on as he got ready to attend
the National War College which began in August. He did not return
to that office until the end of June 1966.
-
3. Halpern observed that during this period Karámessines
was ADDP with Helms moving up to be DDCI. He thought it entirely
possible that Helms and Karamessines could have handled this
on their own.
4. Halpern said that Evan Parker had come into the office
of the DD/P shortly before Helms became DDCI, and had returned
from Honolulu for that purpose. He stayed on for FitzGerald until
Halpern returned from the National War College. He suggested
someone might talk to Evan Parker who may have known something
about it (although he may not). He also suggested talking to Georgia.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Watergate--Frank A. O'Malley
1. At 3 p.m. on the afternoon of 19 February 1974,
Mr. Frederick N. Evans and Lawrence J. Howe interviewed
Mr. Frank A. O'Malley at his residence, 6419 Lakeview
Drive, Falls Church, Virginia. Mr. O'Malley retired
from this Agency in June of 1972. Prior to retirement
Mr. O'Malley was an officer in the External Employment
Assistance Branch, Retirement Activities Division of
the Office of Personnel. It was Mr. O'Malley's function
to assist personnel retiring from this Agency in finding
post-retirement employment. In this capacity Mr. O'Malley
had been instrumental in the placement of Mr. E. Howard:
Hunt in the Robert R. Mullen public relations firm.
purpose of this interview was to attempt to determine if
additional information could be developed from Mr. O'Malley
with regard to the placement of Mr. Hunt with the Mullen
Company.
i
The
2. Mr. O'Malley began the interview by recalling
the nature of his past Agency associations both with Mr.
Hunt and the Mullen Company. Mr. O'Malley stated that
prior to assuming his responsibilities in the Office of
Personnel he had served with Central Cover Staff in the
area dealing with the funding of covert action projects.
In this capacity he had become familiar with the acti-
vities of Mr. Hunt while Mr. Hunt functioned on the Covert
Activities Staff primarily in the propaganda field.
Mr.
O'Malley stated that he first came in contact with the
Mullen Company when he was attempting to find an organi-
zation to handle the public relations effort of a covert
Agency activity known as the Free Cuba Committed. Mr.
O'Malley related that he had arranged this cover through
the Christianform Organization and that his duties in-
volved all aspects of the funding of this activity. Mr.
O'Malley described the nature of his working relationship

8. Ret. .ning to Mr. O'Malley's pivious responsibilities
in coordinating funding for the covert action activities
of Mr. E. Howard Hunt, the issue was raised as to whether
or not the funding of Mr. Hunt's projects continued between
July 1965 and September 1966 while Mr. Hunt was a contract
employce stationed at Madrid, Spain. Mr. O'Malley recalled
that at the time of Mr. Hunt's assignment to Madrid the
statement disseminated for consumption within the Agency
was that Mr. Hunt was retiring. Mr. O'Malley stated that
this was not generally believed. Mr. O'Malley was quite
certain that during this period his office handled no
project funding for Mr. Hunt. In response to specific
question Mr. O'Malley stated that on Mr. Hunt's return to
staff employment the projects and funding which stopped in
-July 1965 were again resumed. Mr. O'Malley was not aware
of any project names or funding mechanisms or post-assignment
accountings in connection with Mr. Hunt's activities in
Madrid.

O'Malley recalled that Mr. Hunt expressed dissatisfaction
with that suggestion in part because of that Mr. Hunt
viewed as that firm's political orientation. Mr. O'Malley
did not claborate further on that remark. Mr. O'Malley
then suggested the use of Anderson Security Consultants,
Incorporated, a commercial cover entity of the Office of
Security. Mr. O'Malley stated that insofar as this"
organization was advertised in the yellow pages and that
Mr. Hunt could be assured of the reliability of the ser-
vices, he felt this to be a reasonable suggestion. Mr.
O'Malley stated that during a subsequent phone call when
Mr. O'Malley asked how his suggestion had worked out,
Mr. Hunt responded, "Yes, they had done a fine job."
At this point. Mr. O'Malley was asked whether or not from
his associations with Mr. Hunt he felt. Mr. Hunt was in
the habit of making glib comments which were not neces-
sarily accurate in order to pass over a subject. Mr.
O'Malley stated that this was categorically so. He said
he was sure that Mr. Hunt had lied to him on a number of
occasions and that, therefore, he was in no position to
- be sure that Mr. Hunt had actually, in fact, used the
services of Anderson Security Consultants. Mr. O'Malley
volunteered the opinion that he suspected the electronic
countermeasures "sweep" was to be carried out in the offices
of the Committee to Re-elect the President.
.
7. In response to a question as to whether he had
ever referred anyone to McCord Associates, Mr. O'Malley
replied that he remembered having referred Walter Brayden.
Mr. Brayden for a time acted as bodyguard to Mrs. Martha
Mitchell. As an aside Mr. O'Malley mentioned that Mr.
Brayden had refused to carry a firearm in spite of the
fact that Mr. McCord told him he could do so on the author-
ity of the Attorney General. Asked specifically if he had
ever referred either William Shea or Teresa Shea to Mr.
McCord, Mr. O'Malley stated that he did not recall specif-
ically referring Teresa Shea and that he was sure that he
had not referred William Shea to him. So, contrary to
previous statements, it is now Mr. O'Malley's belief that
in all probability Mrs. Shea was not referred by this
Agency to Mr. McCord.

with Mr. Robert R. Mullen as being close and cordial.
Mr. O'Malley stated that Mr. Mullen was in the habit
of confiding to him information concerning other Mullen
business contacts and projects. In response to a
specific question, Mr. O'Malley stated that during the
period of his contact with the Mullen Company dealing
with the Free Cuba Committee, Mr. Mullen told him the
Howard Hughes Organization was a client of the concern.
3. Mr. O'Malley reiterated his previous statements
that Mr. Hunt was referred to his office for placement
assistance through the Office of the Executive Director,
then Colonel L. K. White. Mr. O'Malley stated that in
view of Mr. Hunt's interests in the public relations
field, it was thought advisable to put Mr. Hunt in touch
with Mr. Robert Mullen for the purpose of gaining the
benefit of Mr. Mullen's guidance. Mr. O'Malley recalled,
after the initial meeting, Mr. Mullen mentioned having
met Mr. Hunt some years previously in Paris, France.
Mr. O'Malley's office arranged interviews with various
organizations including Reader's Digest and the Kennecott
Copper Company. Through the offices of the Mullen Company
an interview was arranged with the General Foods Corpora-
tion, a Mullen client. Mr. O'Malley stated there was
disappointment that Mr. Hunt had been unsuccessful in
"selling himself" during any of these interviews and that
no job offers had resulted. In response to a question
as to whether or not executive level interest was still
being shown in Mr. Hunt's post-employment placement,
Mr. O'Malley recalled that Mr. Richard Helms, then
Director of Central Intelligence, was listed as a charac-
ter reference on Mr. Hunt's resume and that Mr.. Helms
signed a letter of recommendation to the Kennecott Copper
Company on Mr. Hunt's behalf. Mr. O'Malley recalled being
contacted in the last month of Mr. Hunt's Agency service by
Mr. Mullen, who stated that a decision had been made to
expand their operations. In view of this expansion, Mr.
Mullen had decided he would himself offer Mr. Hunt a job.
Mr. Mullen had stated that he was interested in having Mr.
Hunt begin work immediately. However, Mr. O'Malley re-
called that Mr. Hunt completed retirement formalities and
actually started work for the Mullen Company approximately
a week to 10 days later.

4. Mr. O'Malley stated that contact was maintained
with Mr. Hunt while at the Mullen Company on a continuing
basis, because Mr. O'Malley was interested in Mr. Hunt
for possible referral of other Agency retirees. Mr.
O'Malley also understood that there was Cover and Cons
mercial Staff interest in the Mullen Company, and that
Nr. Hunt became instrumental in discussing several aspects
of the cover operations in his capacity as an officer of
the company. Mr. O'Malley recalled referring various
Agency officers to Mr. Hunt for guidance when these indi-
viduals expressed an interest in entering the public
relations field. Mr. O'Malley did recall disappointment
in feeling Mr. Hunt had generally been less helpful on
these occasions.
'
5. Mr. Hunt contacted Mr. O'Malley on several occasions
requesting referral of retiring Agency employees with
specific qualifications. These instances occurred apparent-
ly after Mr. Hunt had assumed his responsibilities with
the White House. In one instance Mr. Hunt requested re-
ferral of a recently retired Agency secretary. As in
previous memoranda and discussions, Mr. O'Malley was unable
to recall the name of this individual. He did, however,
state that he is quite certain Mr. Hunt turned down the
individual whom he referred. As a point of clarification,
Mr. O'Malley said that this individual had not previously
been known to Mr. Hunt, nor had she previously worked
for him in any capacity. Mr. O'Malley also recalled a
request from Mr. Hunt for an individual having skills in
the area of locks and surreptitious entry. A resume of
Mr. Thomas C. Amato was provided to Mr. Hunt at that time.
It is Mr. O'Malley's recollection that Mr. Hunt specifically
stated that a person with Mr. Amato's qualifications was
needed in connection with a requirement of the Howard
Hughes Organization in Las Vegas, Nevada. Mr. O'Malley
stated the opinion that it was his impression that the
duties involved would include the monitoring of a listening
device in an undisclosed location. Mr. O'Malley reiterated
his understanding that Mr. Anato did not accept Mr. Hunt's
offer of employment.
:
6. Mr. O'Malley then recalled request from Mr. Hunt
for a recommendation of a security service organization
to carry out an electronic countermeasures "sweep.". Mr.
O'Malley recommended the Wackenhut Corporation. Mr.

SUBJECT
Watergate File Research Final Report
'
1. The files of the immediate office of the Chief, OPS/OSG
have been checked for material relevant to the subject of this
memorandum. The check included chronological files of communi-
cations of which I was the author while assigned to Madrid, Spain
in the period July 1970 to July 1973. Nothing pertinent was found.
2. I have attempted to recollect any other details which
conceivably could be pertinent and which relate to the period.
of my assignment to Madrid. The only points which I recall but
on which I have no documentation are these:
a. There were occasional joshing inquiries made of me
by American residents of Madrid about the reported presence
in Spain of E. Howard Hunt in 1972. My standard reply was
that I knew only what I had heard rumored. For the record,
at no time did Hunt contact me, and I have never known of his
having tried to contact any Station personnel in Spain during
the period 1970-73. I made no effort personally to ascertain
whether or not Hunt was in Spain, and I had no effort made by
any Station member.
b. A Station officer, possibly Richard Ouderkirk, now
assigned to Guatemala, was given some information by an
informant in 1972 concerning reported activities in Spain
by Robert Vesco. I suggested that the information be given
informally to the Embassy's Economic Section chief, John
Oliver. That officer was charged with keeping abreast of
developments related to Vesco. The Station did not pursue
that subject, as I recall, because it was not a topic of
reportable interest, according to requirements of the period.

·MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Office of Finance Rocords B. Howard Hunt
1. On the instruction of Mr. Steven L. Kuhn, Chief
of Operations, PSI, the undersigned made an appointment
for the afternoon of 20 February 1974 to interview Mr.
William Caufield, Chief, Certification and Liaison Divi-
sion, Office of Finance, and Mr. Joseph Hudson of Pinance
on the subject of Mr. E. Howard Hunt. At the outset of
the interview Mr. Caufield advised the undersigned that
instruction had been received from the Director of the
Office of Finance, Mr. Thomas Yale, that discussion on
the subject of Mr. Hunt was to be carried out only with
the Office of the Inspector General. Mr. Caufield stated
that he had informed Mr. Yale of the requested interview
and had received this instruction with the suggestion
that the undersigned contact Mr. Yale directly with aný
inquiry.

Accompanied by Mr. Caufield, the undersigned
briefed Mr. Yale on the nature of the request and iden
tified the "Task Force" effort being undertaken by the
Office of Security in concert with the Offices of the
Inspector General and Legislative Counsel. Mr. Yale.
responded that he recognized the legitimacy of the in-
quiry. Mr. Yale explained that subsequent to initiation
of the complete audit being undertaken by Mr. Quinn of
the Audit Staff, the Deputy Director for Management and
Services, Mr. Harold L. Brownman, had requested the
Office of Finance to discontinue their investigation of
Mr. Hunt to avoid duplication. Mr. Yale added paren-
thetically that it was the nature of Finance Officers
not to leave a job half done and that an "informal"
inquiry into Mr. Hunt's financial records had neverthe-
less continued at a more subdued pace.

3. A review of the circumstances surrounding Mr.
Hunt's conversion to Contract Type A employment and
assignment was then undertaken by Messrs. Yalo, Caufield,
Hudson and the undersigned. The contract and payroll
files of Mr. Hunt were reviewed for possible indications
of the nature of the operational activity undertaken in
Madrid. A review of travel vouchers indicated that Mr.
Hunt and his family made accountings indicating departure
from Washington, D. C., on 5 August 1965 with an arrival
in Madrid, Spain, on 16 August 1965. The costs of this
travel were charged to the budget of the Western Hemi-
sphare Division, Deputy Directorate for Plans, Madrid
Station Support account. A subsequent accounting sum-
marized PCS travel expenses and included a payment for
apartment rental for 16, 17 and 18 August 1965 with a
payment in the amount of $125 to Mr. F. Reid Buckley for
this purpo98.
:
4. It was determined that an allottes bank account
in Mr. Hunt's name had been established at the Riggs.
National Bank of Washington. All salary and other non-
operational reimbursements were made to Mr. Hunt through
starile check to this account. An operational account
was established for Mr. Hunt with the Chase Manhattan.
Bank of New York City. A review of all payments made to
Mr. Hunt through the Chase bank account through Mr. Hunt's
operational advance subsidiary account, or 1442 account,
had been made. There was no record of any operational
accounts or advances being processed through this channel.
Mr. Yale stated that this fact defined his concern. He
felt that it was inconceivable that Mr. Hunt could have
undertaken operational activity without some transfer of
or accounting for funds. To date, no such records have
been developed. No reference to a project or project
digraph or operational FAN number has been located. Al
expenses connected with Mr. Hunt identified to date were
charged to the Madrid Station Support. A review made of
Madrid Station records has not indicated any "Developmental
and Target of Opportunity (DTO)" funds or "Other Opera-
tional Activity (00A)" funds expended by or on behalf of
MI.
Hunt. These two accounts would normally be the source
of operational funding not charged against a specific pro-
ject activity.

S. A review of all of the travel vouchers on record
for Mr. ¡¡unt during this period also failed to identify
a project. In addition to the PCS and return youchers,
two other accountings are on record. One accounting
covered a trip by the entire Hunt family to Paris "for
the renewal of visas." A second voucher covered a TDY
trip from Madrid to Washington with return to Madrid
mada by Mr. Hunt from 5 January to 3 January 1966. The
voucher states in the space provided for the citation of
the travel order number "no travel order." The account-
.-
ing was approved and signed by Mr. Thomas Karamessines,
then Deputy Director for Plans. No justification or
statement of purpose for this TDY was given on the account-
ing.
6. Mr. Yale determined that further review of possible
sources or identification of operational funding was in
order. Mr. Yale gave instructions that the entire 1442 -
advance account of Mr. Hunt be reviewed for other possible
channels of funding outside of the New York Chase account.
After discussion, it was agreed that particular attention
be taken to any items connected with publishing or book.
royalties. Mr. Yale noted that the royalty offset waiver
provision ammended to Mr. Hunt's contract was, in his ex-
perience, somewhat unusual.
7. Mr. Yale was informed by the undersigned of the
intention to interview Mr. Edward Ryan, currently Chief,
Division D, who was at the time of Mr. Hunt's Madrid assign
ment, Deputy Chief of the Western Hemisphere Division. Mr.
Yale suggested that Mr. Davis Powell also be interviewed.
The undersigned informed Mr. Yale that this had been done
and briefed Mr. Yala on the generally negative results of
the interview. Mr. Yale then recommended that Mr. Sam
Halpern be interviewed. Mr. Yale noted that Mr. Halpern
had been an assistant to Mr. Desmond Fitzgerald when the
latter was Chief, Nestern Hemisphere Division and had
companied Mr. Fitzgerald when he became Deputy Director for
Plans. Mr. Yale recalled that subsequent to Mr. Fitzgerald's
passing that Mr. Halpern remained on the staff and acted as
an Executive Officer for Mr. Thomas Karamessines. Mr. Yale
stated that from his experience, Mr. Karamessines would
have delegated all the arranging of "details" surrounding
un assignment such as Mr. Hunt's to Mr. Halpern. Mr. Yale
offered the parenthetical observation of his surprise at
what he interpreted to be reticence to date to intervew
Mr. Halpern.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT:
Interview of Mr. Davis Powell
on the David St. John Novels
LC Fele !! Yab 38
*
1.
On the morning of 15 February 1974, the
undersigned interviewed Mr. Davis Powell, currently
a Budget Officer on the staff of the Deputy Director
for Management and Services. Mr. Powell is located
in Room 7018. During 1965 Mr. Powell was Chief of
Support of the then designated Western European Divi-
sion. In July 1965 a contract was writton authorizing
salary and benefits to Mr. E. Howard Hunt for an assign-
ment under non-official cover to Madrid, Spain. The
purpose of this interview was to determine if Mr. Powell
had any information on Mr. Hunt's activities during this
period.
2. Mr. Powell responded that from his recollection
it was Mr. Hunt's habit to deal only with the most senior
officer available. In this case Mr. Hunt dealt directly
with the then Chief of Western European Division, Mr.
Rolf Kingsley. Mr. Powell states that, in his capacity
as Chief of Support, any activity undertaken to support
Mr. Hunt's assignment to Madrid was undertaken second
and thirdhand on receipt of instructions from Mr. Kingsley's
office. He further stated that he was never briefed on
the purpose of Mr. Hunt's mission and could add little in
terms of speculation. Mr. Powell recommended that Mr.
Edward Ryan, who was then Deputy Chief of Western European
Division, be contacted. Mr. Powell also suggested that
Miss Martha Sevilla be interviewed. Miss Seville was the
Executive Secretary in Western European Division during the
time that Mr. Hunt's contract was written and Miss Seville
subsequently served in Madrid herself. Mr. Powell under-
stands that Miss Seville is currently assigned to the
office of the Chief, European Division.

1. At 0930 on the morning of 15 February 1974,
the undersigned interviewed. Mr. Rogers Brooks, Chief,
Contract Personnel Division, Office of Personnel.
The purpose of this interview was to determine if Mr.
Brooks had any information not contained in the Con-
tract Personnel file of Mr. E. Howard Hunt on the
latter's activities while a Contract Type A employee.
2. Mr. Brooks summarized his recollections by
saying that, although it was not common practice it
was not entirely unusual for highly sensitive contracts
to be administered without the contracting officer being
made aware of the operational objective involved. Mr.
Brooks stated that he recalls some of the controversy
involved in preparing the contract dealing with the
question of offset and housing allowance, but he was
unable to recall any of the details. It was Mr. Brooks'
suggestion that the Office of Finance be contacted and
that their contract personnel records on Mr. Hunt be.
checked for information.

3. Mr. Rocca was thoroughly candid and cooperative
during the course of this interview. He was unable to
suggest alternate means of attempting to determine if
any official Agency sponsorship of Mr. Hunt did in fact
exist. Mr. Rocca did venture the opinion that he felt
that in all probability an official acquiescence on the
part of senior officials might have been involved rather
than an official sponsorship. It was agreed by all in
this discussion that the nature of any informal support
given to Mr. Hunt would be far more difficult to define
in the absence of any formalized agreements.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Possible Agency Sponsorship of the
David St. John Novels
1. The details summarizing an interview on 4 February
1974 with Mr. Walter Pforzheimer, Curator, Historical
Intelligence Collection, were set forth in a menorandum
addressed to Mr. Stoven L. Kuhn dated 6 February 1974. Mr.
Kuhn was briefed by the undersigned on this information
during the afternoon of 5 February 1974. Later the same
afternoon, at Mr. Kuhn's direction, a conference was held
with Messrs. Scott Breckenridge and John Richards of the
Office of the Inspector General.
2. During this conference the speculation was entertained
that Mr. E. Howard Hunt had, in fact, been under Agency
sponsorship with the knowledge of Mr. Richard Helms in his
preparation of a series of spy novels under the pseudonym,
David St. John If it can be accepted as a reasonabla
supposition that Mr. Hunt had some highly compartmented
financial arrangement authorized by senior Agency officials
to write these books, then it is likely that this relation-
ship continued after Mr. Hunt officially retired. It is
specifically noted that Mr. Hunt retired 30 April 1970.
Subsequent to the retirement, a David St. John book appeared
in print in 1971 and another in 1972. These manuscripts
were apparently prepared during the time that Mr. Hunt was
employed by the Robert R. Mullen Company.
Lagistative
"
3. Minutes from the Office of General Counsel make
references to a concern of Senator Baker over an alleged
financial relationship between Mr. Helms and Mr. Hunt
which continued subsequent to Mr. Hunt's formal retirement.
Senator Baker has reportedly made reference to a payment
of some thirty thousand dollars with the parenthetical
comment that Mr. Helms would not have that amount of money

It
'
to provide Mr. Hunt from his private funds. Mr. Richards
of the Inspector General Staff opinioned that if the
Agency had sponsored the St. John books, it was likely
that Mr. Hunt had so informed Senator Baker.
4. Adding possible weight to this line of speculation
is the fact that subsequent to publishing the last St. John
novel, Mr. Hunt published a novel entitled, Eduardo, using
his old Agency issued alias, Edward J. Hamilton. The
suggestion is that this writing effort was done by Mr. Hunt
free of any fiduciary relationship with the Agency involved
in the use of the St. John pen name.
5. Mr. Howard J. Osborn, Director of Security, was
briefed on the above by the undersigned in the presence of
Mr. Kuhn on the evening of 5 February 1974.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Interview with Mr. Raymond A. Rocca
on the David St. John Novels
1. On the morning of 14 February 1974 Messrs.
Frederick Evans and Lawrence Howe interviewed Mr. Raymond
A. Rocca, Deputy Chief, Counter Intelligence Operations.
The purpose of the interview was to follow up on infor-
mation contained in Office of Security files which stated
the belief that individuals in the Counter Intelligence
Operations office had knowledge of the writing activities
of Mr. E. Howard Hunt. This belief was a matter of record
in the files of the former Security Research Staff and was
attributed to Mr. Paul Gaynor, now retired, and Mr. Edward
Saylǝ.
2. During this interview Mr. Rocca was specifically
asked whether or not he had knowledge of the existence of
any form of official sponsorship or encouragement to Mr.
E. Howard Hunt to write novels to improve the image of
this Agency. Additionally, Mr. Rocca was asked whether
or not any assistance was ever requested of the Counter
Intelligence Operations office to be provided to Mr. Hunt
or whether or not that staff had ever had any relationship
with Mr. Hunt whatsoever. In response to these questions
Mr. Rocca responded "on the record" that he has no knowledge
of any such arrangements nor at any time was he party to any
assistance or any requests for assistance to Mr. Hunt Mr.
Rocca stated that the particular section which he had been
most actively concerned in the past years was responsible
for handling a variety of tasks categorized under the area
of "setting the record straight." In this sense, the "image"
mission of the office was to counter misinformation cur-
rently in the media or otherwise believed to be part of an
effort to discredit the Agency. Mr. Rocca feels that any
assumption that Mr. Hunt was engaged in any form of Agency
sponsored image activity would have probably load to the
conclusion that it was done under the Counter Intelligence
Operations. However, Mr. Rocca emphatically stated that
this was not the case.

:::
11: On 41 February 1974, Mr. Walter Pforzheimer, Curator,
Historical Intelligence Collection, was interviewed by the-
undersigned concerning his knowledge of a series of novels..
written by Mr. B. Howard Hunt. This interview was undertaken
at your request in an effort to determine if Mr. Hunt had.
acted in any capacity in cooperation with Counter Intelligence
Operations. It has previously been alleged in Office of
Security records that Messrs. Paul Gaynor and Edward Sayle
of Security Research Staff, believed that Mr. Hunt had written
novels at Agency request and that this effort had been known
to Mr. James Angleton, Chief, CI Operations. with religion

2. Mr. Pforzheimer provided a verbal summary of his.
knowledge of Mr. Hunt's fictional writings under the pen
name, David St. John. Mr. Pforzheimer stated that when the
first St. John book, On Hazardous Duty, appeared in 1965, he
undertook to identify the true name of the author.
Pforzheimer related that he checked with a source in the copy-
right office only to find out that the true name was not given
on the copyright application. The mailing address given for
the author was checked against a telephone cross reference
directory. The address on the copyright application was.
identified with Mr. E. Howard Hunt. Mr. Pforzheimer stated
that after making the identification, he called Mr. Thomas
Karamessines and related his discovery. Mr. Pforzheimer.
recalled from the nature of Mr. Karamessines' reaction that
he had uncovered a sensitive matter of senior officer concern.
Mr. Pforzheimer stated that he then recommended to Mr.
Karamessines that "if the Agency is involved in this thing
why not see to it that Hunt leaves his address off the copy-
right applications in the future." Mr. Karamessines reportedly

6. A check of Office of Security records did not develop
any indication that any of the David St. John manuscripts were
ever submitted for review in accordance with Agency regulations.
There is no documentary evidence currently available to the
Office of Security to either confirm or deny possible Agency
sponsorship of the books written by Mr. E. Howard Hunt under
the pen name, David St. John,.

accerted the suggestion and Mr. Pfortzheimer recalls that
subsequent copyright applications were submitted without
the address. Within five minutes of the conversation with-
Mr. Karamessines, Mr. Pforzheimer recalls being called by
Mr. Richard Helms, then Deputy Director of Central Intelligence..
Mr. Pforzheimer recalls the substance of the conversation as
being, "for Christ sake Walter, this is the first book to...
come along and say something good about the Agency." "Why
not leave the Goddamn thing alone."
3. The undersigned asked Mr. Pforzheimer, who to his
knowledge, would be in a position to confirm or deny whether
Mr. Hunt was under any form of Agency sponsorship in his
writing of the David St. John novels. Mr. Pfortzheimer replied
that he was never officially briefed on the matter and that
only Mr. Helms or Mr. Karamessines could provide the answer.
Mr. Pforzheimer was then asked if either Nr. Angleton or Mr.
Rocca of Counter Intelligence Operations would have any
knowledge of this activity. Mr. Pforzheimer replied that he
doubted it seriously.
4. Mr. Pforzheimer went on to relate that he was
occasionally tasked to do research for Mr. Hunt. He recalled
on one occasion being asked to research the Indian religious
rites involving use of funeral pyres. Mr. Pforzheimer
remembered that this theme figures significantly in Mr. Hunt's
subsequent novel Tower of Silence which appeared under the
St. John pen name in 1966. Mr. Pforzheimer parenthetically
pointed out the origin of the pen name as being the names of
Mr. Hunt's two sons--David and St. John.
5. Tracing Mr. Hunt's career assignments, it is noted
that he was assigned to the Office of the Deputy Director
for Operations then designated, the DDP/Operations Group, in
February 1965. The first David St. John book was published
during 1965. From June 1965 through September 1966, Mr. Hunt
was assigned to Madrid, Spain as a Contract Agent. During
1966, three St. John books appeared in print, the highest out-
put for any year. Mr. Hunt published one book under the
St. John pseudonym in 1967, and one each in the years 1963,
1969, 1971 and 1972. Mr. Hunt officially retired as an Agency
Staff Employee effective 30 April 1970.

C. He also suggested that another person--definitely no friend of
Hunt--who might have some recall or have picked up information about
the book-writing matter might be Anita Potocki of CI Staff, formerly of
Division D. (I gather that she did not have official knowledge, but because
of her dislike for Hunt, she made it somewhat her business to follow his
career!)

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Kuhn
SUBJECT: General Gaynor's Recollections
1. This date, at your instruction, I called Gen. Paul F. Gaynor
to seek his recollections regarding his knowledge of the writings of
4. Mr. Hunt and any official who might be aware of the circumstances
of any Agency involvement in that effort.
2. Gen. Gaynor advised that his memory is not altogether clear
on the matter, and that he was "reaching," but stated that has he
reconstructs the matter:
a. He became aware that Hunt, while in WH, was accomplishing
a steady flow of spy books, and that security approval was not being re-
quested on the manuscripts before submission to publishers. (He stated
that this activity continued later, as he recalls it, in CI Staff, and
"
agreed with idea that the volume of writings was sufficient to indicate
that a great of time was involved in Hunt's writing.) Gen. Gaynor advised
that he raised the issue "up front" on several occasions. The reaction
he recieved to his raising the issue was that "keep your stinking nose out
of this business." He stated that he was lead to believe that Mr. Helms
desired to improve the image of the intelligence profession and the Agency
and that Hunt's books were a part of the program to do so. He stated that
he was never told outright that this was the case, but the responses he
recieved lead him to believe this was the case.

in the "image" materials. He stated that Piorzheimer seemed to be aware
of all the details - on an up to date basis of Hunt's departure from the
Agency to join the public relations firm, to the degree that Gen. Gaynor
gained the belief that Hunt was merely moving his desk outside the building,
but being paid by the same source as before. He also advised that he kept
Miss Ethel Mendoza fairly current on what he was learning about Hunt's
activities because she followed the case for him, and suggested that her
recall about what he had learned and when and what resulted, might be
«better than his at this date. (He also mentioned an incident in which Morse
Allen while on a TDY was told by a COS to ask Headquarters to remove Hunt
from the Area because of his direct liaison with the president of the country,
and other activities which were confounding station operations. Later, the COS
told Morse to forget about relaying the message, with the implication that
Hunt was being directed by higher authority in the Agency and the COS did not
wish to get in the middle by complaining. He said Morse would probably

by this Agency from November 1949 until his voluntary retirement.
on 30 April 1970. La 1971, Subject served as an advisor to President
Nixon in relation to his trip to China. Subject is of current interest ·
to the Central Cover Staff.
2. Subject graduated from Brown University in 1940. He
served with the United States Navy from early 1941 until late 1942.

then from May 1949 until February 1919 was employed by the Economic
Cooperation Administration, serving in Paris, France, as an aide to
Avarell Harriman,
3. A background investigation conducted by the Federal Bureau
of Investigation in July 1949 revealed no indication of instability on
Subject's part, but it was later learned that Subject had been refused
an increase in salary with the Economic Cooperation Administration
and had been permitted to resign. He was described as highly intelligent;
but blindly selfish and egotistical.
.
4. Subject's wife, Dorothy Louise Coutiere Hunt, was investigated
for Agency employment in 1946. Her former husband was described
as a habitual drunkard, and Subject's wife was described as slightly
unstable and not inclined to remain in one place for any length of time.
She did not enter on duty, having accepted a position with the Economic
Cooperation Administration in Paris. Car Paris sources later reported
la
that Subject's wife was formerly his mistress and was openly flouted

5. Subject entered on duty as an Intelligence Officer, G5-13,
on 3 November 1949. In December 1950 he was assigned as Chief
of Station, Mexico City, and then served as Chief of Mission there

until February 1957. He was then assigned as Chief of Station,
Montevideo, Uruguay. Subject was Chief of Station in Mortsvideo

to use his personal influence with the President of Uruguay to have
his assigament there extended, but he returned to the United States
in June 1960 and was assigned to Mexico City on Project JMARC.
6. A cable from Montevideo, dated 6 November 1960, indicates .
that Subject had written former Uruguayan contacts commenting that
ha was working on the Cabaa problem and publishing an anti-Castro
newspaper in Miami. It was recommended that Subject be warned
about such indiscreet remarks, but apparently no action was taken.
7. In November 1961, Subject was reassigned to the DDP/
Covert Action Staff, and in January 1962 to the Office of the Chief
of the same Staff. In July 1952 Subject was transferred to the DODS
Research and Publications Section in Washington, and in July 1964

3. On 25 January 1970 a source of the Office of Security
learned that Subject was circulating through the publishing community
"Give Us This Day," a manuscript written under his former operational
allas and dealing with the events of the Bay of Pigs. Investigation
disclosed that the manuscript had been in the possession of Tom Wallacė,
of Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, Inc. as early as 9 July 1963 and that
it was sent on that date to William F. Buckley, Jr., of the National
Review. The manuscript was sent to the Arlington House and Walker
and Company as well. Both rejected it as too controversial, as had
Holt, Rinehart, and Winston.

two years ago to bis agent, Max Wilkinson, and to William F. Buckley,
Jr. He sald be had only wanted an opinion from these gentlemen, and
added that the manuscript had been returned to him. He had, he said,
not wanted it published. Subject was instructed as to the danger of such
a manuscript being published, and was to attempt to determine how
many copies of it might be in circulation. He was not to contact Walker
and Company, who were the scures of the original information.
10. A reinvestigation of Subject was conducted by the Office of
Security in July 1970. Subject and his wife were described by six
neighbors acquainted with them for up to nine years, as excellent
parents, good neighbors, and fine community citizens.
11. On 19 July 1971, Subject was reported by the Jersey City,
New Jersey, Jonsmal to have joined the White House Staff as a

This remorandum contains a recommendation in para-
graph 4 for the approval of the Deputy Director for Support.
2. Terence S. CHARANIC (?) is a Contract Employee as-
signed to the Hadrid area in Spain in a sensitive assignant
since his conversion from a Staff Employes on 4 July 1965.
CRIZANÁC was a CS-15, step 7 (319,330.00 per annum) and he
is being paid at the game rate in his present contract
status. His contract provides that he will be entitled to
a living quarters allozance in conformance with regulations
of this organization applicable to its appointed personnel.
3.
The basic living quarters allowance for Class II
officers in Madrid is $3,000 per annuin.. The house which
CHARANAC has located, with a one year lease from 15 November
1965 to 14 November 1963, has an anual rent of $5,500.00
oncluding utilition. Therefore, for rent alone, ha 7ill bə
$1,060.00 per year over the 160 percent maximum allowed
czdər the provisions of: FR 43-10b. On a 75/25 percent
sharing basis of the 60 percent over the quarters allowance,
he would be out of pocket 32,595.00,

ussignment, his request formlial on his housing costa 739

Retention of
Royalties by a Contract Employee
1. You have requested the opinion of this Office in regard to
the retention of future royalties which might be earned by Terence S.
CRABANAĊ as a result of his literary efforts. We believe that he is
entitled to retain such royalties without an offset against his Agency
salary.
2. We have been advised by Mr. Gene Stevens, WE/Support, that
CRABANAC's cover does not include the role of a writer; CRABANAC's
cover for status will only be a light one of a retired Foreign Service
Officer. Therefore, paragraph 7 of his contract dated 4 July 1965 may
remain as written. Royalties from the fictional works that he writes as
a profitable hobby will not be emoluments received from or through his
"cover activities."

Retention of Royalties by
a Contract Employee

1. Reference is made to the telephone conversation
of 25 July 1965 between yourself and Rogers C. Brooks of
this Office wherein background information relating to the
assignment of Terence S. Crabazac was discussed.
2. Subject will apparently develop a cover as a writer,
a field wherein he has an already demonstrated talent based
upon several publications. The objective of the cover is to pro-
vide a basis of attribution for some of his income. At the time
of the preparation of Mr. Crabazac's contract, the specific
detail of his cover was unknown.
3. Request your opinion in regard to the retention of
possible royalties earned by Crabanac as a result of his
literary efforts or whether such income should be properly
offset.

1. This office herein recommends an amendment to CRABANAC's

2. This office acknowledges the CCC opinion, Reference A, which
determined CRABANAC may retain without Agency salary offset any future

cover does not include role of a writer.
3. As Subject's cover "ectivities" have been officially clarified

which the Agency will be making all entitlement payments and actually
be will receive no funds from any cover, this paragraph, which is misleading,
has no meaning in Subject's contract and it is hereby recommended that
it be deleted from CRABANAC's Supplement.
4. Further, in future cases when a cover is so light that Subject
will not be receiving funds from cover it is recommended that no "Offset"

1.
At the recent request of the Deputy Director for
Management and Services, the Office of Finance has searched
its records to determine if we could find any payment to
Mr. Hunt in an amount of approximately $30,000 that required
no accounting.
2. We have searched the following records:
a.

C.
The expense runs for the period July 1964 to
June 1973 for the immediate Office of the DCI,
the immediate Office of the DD/P, FI Staff,
CI Staff, CA Staff and the Office of Security.
We have checked various items that were re-
flected in these expense records but have
identified nothing relating to Mr. Hunt.
The Madrid Station, JMWAVE and FR/Washington
Office accountings to determine if there were
funds passed by the Stations to Mr. Hunt during
'the year he served under non-official cover in
Madrid. We could find no payment to Mr. Hunt
either in his true name or his two identified
pseudonyms.
Mr. Hunt's travel claims for the period
1960-1972 and have found nothing in these
travel claims that were not consistent with
normal travel expenses, i.e., transportation,

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: E. Howard Hunt
20 December 1973
=
1. I spoke with Fig Coleman about Hunt's assignment to Spain.
I had spoken with him back in August when we were inquiring into
reported activities involving Mrs. Hunt. ....
:
2. Coleman said that he got out of the War College in May 1964
(by which he fixed the time), and took over the Iberian desk. Bill
Ryan was C/EUR (or was it WE Division at the time). In early autumn
Ryan said that he had just been informed by the DDP (Karamessines)
that Hunt was to be assigned to Madrid as DCOS, as a directed assign-
ment by Helms. A memo was prepared and sent to the COS, Jim Noel
(now retired). There was nothing further for about a month when Ryan
called Coleman in and showed him a RYBAT letter from Noel stating.
that Ambassador Stanley J. Woodward would not have Hunt in the
Embassy.
3. Woodward had been the Ambassador to Uruguay when Hunt
was COS Montevideo. He had a low opinion of Hunt and was counting
the days until Hunt left. The President of Uruguay visited President.
Eisenhower in the States, at which time he requested a personal favor--
that Hunt be reassigned to Montevideo. So Hunt took another tour.
Woodward was outraged, and had his revenge in 1964 when Hunt was
to be sent as DCOS to Madrid.
4. After a couple of months--carly 1965--Ryan called Coleman
in and, observing that there was more than one way to skin a cat,
told him that Hunt was going to Spain under nonofficial cover. This
didn't require anything special, Ryan saying that he didn't know
much about it. It came to him from Karamessines on Helms' order.
Hunt was to have the telephone number of the COS, but he would do
nothing for the station. Hunt was to submit administrative vouchers
for reimbursement of his expenses and they were to be paid. Coleman
said he never saw Hunt before he went out. He knows that there was
no operational reporting, to indicate that Hunt was doing anything.

"
The vouchers were not large, although the documentation was poor.
Coleman raised the question with Ryan about his signing off, and
Ryan said he could talk to Karamessines if he wished. Because
Coleman had a close personal association with Karamessines he
did just that. He was told by Karamessines that he didn't know much
about it either--"Helms said send him out." He was instructed to go
ahead..
5. “In early July 1966 (4 July) Coleman went to Madrid. He
had a ten day turnover with Jim Noel. Hunt had already gone and
he did not see him. Noel said he didn't know what Hunt did, but
that Coleman need not worry because he was gone.
6. Several months ago Noel was at a seminar at which
Ambassador Woodward was also present. At the time he asked
about Hunt. Woodward said it might still be dragged into the press.
Tad Szulc had been after Woodward about the Hunt assignment to
Spain. Coleman observed that Szulc did have a long article on Hunt
in the New York Times, and the Spain assignment was mentioned,
but without any conclusions as to its significance..
7. Coleman said the RYBAT file of C/EUR may have something on
the event, but not much. A letter out and the reply, but not much more.
