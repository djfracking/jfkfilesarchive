counselling on courses of action to cope with unique situations
was always sound and responsible.
4. The work in this assignment provided little occasion
for Mr. Joannides to demonstrate attitudes on either EEO matters or
economy, considerations that are required by regulation for comment
in Fitness Reports. As a result, no comment is made.
5. Not because of the demands on his superior talents,
but because of the cool efficacy with which he handled an unusual
special assignment, Mr. Joannides' work is evaluated as Outstanding.

1. This Memorandum in Lieu of Fitness Report is prepared
in accordance with HR 20-20, for the period mid-June 1978 through
12 January 1979. The occasion of the Fitness Report is the
retirement of the rating official.
2. The undersigned was detailed in mid-May to serve
as the Agency's Principal Coordinator for work with the House
Select Committee on Assassinations. As it became apparent that the volume
of the work required assignment of additional full-time personnel, the
decision was made that one experienced officer was needed to handle
the DDO account. A senior officer experienced in DDO work and available
to serve for several months was requested. Mr. Joannides was known to
the undersigned by reputation, although not personally, and arrangements
were made for his detail to the work. While there is no way to outline
the qualifications that one should have for this sort of work, it
became quickly clear that Mr. Joannides was the perfect man for it.
3. Mr. Joannides was responsible for a new procedure in
recording of exchanges with the HSCA. As it developed, the Agency's
logs and records on the status of requests by the HSCA and the Agency's
responses became the only reliable record; it was clear that the HSCA
often did not know the status of business in this respect and time
and time again had to come to this office for clarification. Beyond
that early contribution to the ordering of the affairs of the office,
Mr. Joannides handled day-to-day follow-ups of requirements by
telephone with the DDO focal point as well as throughout the DDO.
Further, the firm position that he took with the young investigators
in response to aggressive harassment on some occasions was exactly
what the situation called for. A person of his maturity and experience
handled the job exactly as required by the situation. If the peculiar
nature of the work did not call on Mr. Joannides for all the talents of
his wide experience, it nonetheless was his experience and quick
perceptions that ensured a superior performance. His advice and

the proper manner of carrying on covert operations and voices his
convictions without fear. He is an excellent supervisor and is respected
by the members of the branch for his forthrightness and his sober
judgment and sound advice. His handling of agents and contacts on the

and friendliness. In short he is a distinct asset to the clandestine
services both administratively and operationally.

CONTINUATION SHEET
Section C - Narrative Comments
C
Subject has additional growth potential as an intelligence
officer and as a first echelon supervisor of individuals doing
a basic intelligence task. Ethnic origins, foreign language
fluency and experience acquired to date generally dictates a
career for Subject in the general arena of Greek operations.
While the major thrust of Subject's career orientation should
be geared toward Greece and its related problems, it is believed
that it is essential that, on a periodic basis, Subject be directed
into non-Greek areas of interest, in order that the continued
challenge of new horizons will stimulate Subject to develop to
his full capacity. In practical terms, this means that out of
any eight-year time cycle, at least two years should be spent
by Subject on non-Greek or even non-European affairs. This
officer has the potential to be a broad-gauged officer but he
must be stimulated and led in that direction which will fully
harness the totality of his potential.
The rating officer would be pleased to have Subject work
with him at any other Field Station that might be entrusted to
the rating officer.

Reference is made to paragraph C of subject's previous fitness report
dated 10 January 1963 which is still applicable. During the period
covered by this report subject has done an excellent job in the handling
of a significant student exile group which hitherto had successfully
resisted any important degree of control. Under subject's direction
an exile teachers' group reached a high level of effectiveness in the
propaganda field and was turned over to another case officer.
Subject has effectively terminated unproductive operations in the prop
field (one magazine and a news letter) and is building up Station radio
capability directed at the maintarget.
His high professional standards, complete comprehension of the problems
faced by the Station and strong urge to win in our struggle with the
opposition make it a distinct pleasure to see him take over as Chief
of the PW branch.

proven by performance that he can accomplish assigned operational tasks
in allowable time limits. The period covered by this fitness report
represents Subject's initial Agency exposure to
management responsibilities which are implicit in a branch chief's
assignment in a Station that has 313] employees. Subject responded
to the challenge of the first echelon supervisory responsibilities
in an exemplary manner. Subject managed a branch that had a yearly
budget of two million four hundred thousand dollars. These funds
were judiciously spent on printed propaganda, white and black radio
programs, and on political action operations which were implemented
via labor, student and professional groups. Subject has the knack of
judiciously blending quality with quantity and in this melding effort,
Subject reflected cost consciousness and effectiveness in the use of
personnel, space equipment and funds. Subject has a distinct flair
for political action operations and can translate policy directives
into meaningful action programs by all of his assets. Subject has the
ability to delegate authority and to appropriately fix responsibility
with those officers whom he supervises. In the management field;
Subject's only discernible weakness is a tendency to be abrupt with
subordinates. It is believed that this minor shortcoming will be
overcome with the acquisition of added experience in the field of
personnel management. On balance therefore, Subject's overall perfor-
mance as a supervisor and as an intelligence officer warrants an 99
