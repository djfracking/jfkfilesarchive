workings of lion based on his experience in Panama, his frequent
visits there, and his contacts with this office curing the jest
}
From time to time subject provides bits of information or opinions on local
affairs which he thinks may be of interest. Ways in which he could be of further
operational use have also been discussed with him in general terms. Subject
has provided his name for use in registering a station automobile and for
obtaining postoffice toxes.
2.
Subject appears to be well versed in some of the operational methods
of the organization and has always expressed a willingness to assist in any.
way possible. This might include acting as a cut-out, furnishing general
political and Communist information, setting up cover establishments, and the
development of informants in several fields. To date, no specific opening for
his services has been evolved but it is highly likely that such a spot will;
appear in the future.
3. This Mission foresees no strong obstacle or reason against subject's
being contacted by KXJUMP again but feels that if subject had any inform8-
tion of possible interest to this organization he would immediately contact
the writer. In addition, such a contact might possibly re-kindle subject's
previcusly expressed feeling that at times it appeared that "the left hard
didn't know what the right hand was doing". It is suggested that if KUJUM
has ary specific type of information in mind, questions indicating the line of
interest could be forwarded to this Mission and placed before subject for Mis
comment. If KUJUMP particularly desires to interview subject it is suggested
that this Mission be authorized to so inform subject so that the matter will
appear completely coordinated in subject's mind.

PERIOD COVERED: 20 October, 1947 to present.
Subject's original assignment was the estab-
lishment of an intelligence net for the
Republic of Panama with a view to developing
information on our various YAWNER objectives.
The assignment was too broad because sub-
ject is establishing a new business and has not
had sufficient time to devote to our work.
His activities were redirected along the lines
of cultivation of specific individuels.
His cultivation and recruitment of the
informant HYDRACTD was excellent. His hand-

As stated above subject has performed ex-

permitted HYDROL to receive home office
training. He has fairly good contacts and
is capable of cultivating almost ang one

more valuable in the immediate future.
To date subject's intelligence information
has only been valuable as a supplement to
other sources. His operational information
has been excellent and is of real value.
He is more interested in the operational
side of our activities than in reporting.
This agent has been handled as outlined
in TZF-151 subject to the modifications
of increased social contacts necessitated
by the fact that subject's wife is in-

HYDROL's background is such that he regards
the sky as the limit in the expenditure of
Intelligence Ounds and is inclined to commit
himself financially without real assurance
that we will receive full value for the funds
expended. Realizing that time is an impor-
tant factor in the development of high level
operations we hope this will prove to be
the most efficient expenditure of our funds.
If not we will convert the funds to other
projects. As a matter of operational or-
ganization we feel our ultimate objective
in this area should be to ferret out and
operate with a mimimum number of skilled
American resident agents. Offsetting the
criticism mentioned stove are the facts

Interview with Alfonso Rudolf Nichtrich by Paul P. Parton
1. On 17 November 1948, the subject called at Que Building and
was interviewed by Paul P. Paxton. He had been advised to pay his
respects to Harry A.. Real by the Chief of Station, Fanama City. Its
subject o
✓ to learn what the procedure would be if he wished to offer
his services with CIA at a future date. At the present time he is
managing the Royal Crown Bottling Works in Panama City and is negotiating
for a franchise to distribute a milk product in that area. His primary
purpose in coming to the United States at this time was to make arrange-
ments for this latter business venture. The subject has been aiding
the Chief of Station in Panama for the past year in a manner that has been
extremely helpful to our operations. During the war he was a Lt. Col.
in United States Army Intelligence serving for a considerable time in
China in an undercover capacity. He gives evidence of being very well
versed in intelligence matters and shows, keen appreciation for security.
matters.
2. He stated that within six or eight months his private business
affairs in Fanam would be developed to the point where he could accept
a position with this Agency in a full-time capacity. Es evidenced
interest in either the Latin American A99 - in the Dew
China. Imade no commitments as far as future employment is concerned
but I did suggest that you visit this headquarters on his next visit
to the United States providing he is in a position to accept full-time
employment. I recommend that his application be given serious con-
sideration in the light of his past intelligence experience and by
- virture of his valuable assistance to our operations in Fans.

1. HYDROL.
2. Subject's background has been with the U. S. Army in China,
where he organized a complete intelligence net. He is an organizer and
planner and best qualified for the supervision of intelligence nets and
informants, and intelligence operations in general.
3. He is a very personable individual and has the facility for
getting along with Latins. He is very well accepted even though he has
been here only a little over a year.

is also well qualified to operate in the China Theater in view of his
past experiences, although he has no knowledge of the language.
5. Subject makes frequent business trips to Mexico.
6. Subject has discussed plans for expanding his business into
South America.
7. Subject has five people working for him. (a) HYDRACID;
HYDRAMANIC; and the subject of TZP-A-269. He has also cultivated two
unwitting informants, one of whom is a fairly prominent Arnulfista and
the other is a socially prominent Fanamanian and businessman on whom we
will submit biographical data at a future date. (b) None of the people are
paid. The subject of TZF-A-269 has been informed that we will defray any
expenses which he may have incidental to our operations. HYDPACID has
expressed a desire to have a savings or retirment fund opened for him in
the United States. This we have agreed to do and estimate that the cost
will be about $100 to $150 per month.

start payment the figure will be something less than $150.00 a month and it
will probably be placed into some sort of a savings account. This plan

may be placed into effect at any time.
19. Subject has been informed that we will defray all expenses
incurred by him on our behalf.
20. No cost of purchase of information is involved but he is author-
ized to engage in this practice.
EVALUATION OF SUBJECT'S WORK
21. Subject appears to be a highly dependent individual. (a) The
accuracy of his reports have been good. (b) From a security angle he is
excellent.
22. In view of subject's previous intelligence background, it is
believed he is only suitable for semi-covert work.
23. Subject is unquestionably a high-level operative and quite
possibly might penetrate any of the local social or government circles,
but again his background from China is such that it would probably be im-
norible for him to assemplish a penetration of any leftist organizations
or foreign intelligence agencies.

9. In view of the fact that subject contacted the Home Office
prior to his departure from the United States, he is thoroughly cognizant
of the ultimate destination of his information.
10. Yes. In view of HYDROL's experience in the intelligence field
he has been given the assignment of supervising and controlling the
activities of HYDRACID who has an excellent knowledge of the local situa-
tion but lacks experience as an intelligence operative. This also serves
to maintain EXERACID's cover.

take place between HYDROL and the Chief of Station. These are usually at

that the Chief of Station and ETEROL both have children attending the same
school and the wives are acquainted socially.

he is now better established and better oriented, it is contemplated that
he will become more active.
14. Contract with subject is oral. A written contract will be pre-
pared at the time he is placed on our payroll.
15. Yes. He is attempting a high-level penetration of the Partido
del Preblo. At the present tize, a foreign national who has been approached
by HYDRACID is attempting to buy one of the Directors of the Partido del
Pueblo.
16. Subject is quite capable of using his own judgment on the sort
of work he is to do. Since his time has been limited in the past, he has
confined his activities to projects specifically requested by this Station.
PAYMENT
17. Subject is a volunteer informant who is rewarded for his services
by the occasional presentation of exchange commodities. Since subject does
not have U. 5. Government Commissary privileges, purchases on his behalf
are rade by the Station. This results in approximately 60% reduction in the
cost of necessities purchased in this manner.
18. Yes. Salary arrangements have been discussed between HYDROL and
the Chief of Station. He both agree that no salary should be paid until such
time as he becomes more productive. It is contemplated that when we actually

WICHTRICH, Alfonso Rudolph
4 December 1947
On December 3, 1947 the investigative files
of Confidential Government gency (L-2) were examined and
disclosed the following:
Included in the file is an Investigative
report dated June 25, 1943 regarding one. Captain Al. R.
Wichtrich, my Serial Number 0377220, which revealed
no adverse information regarding Subject. It was men-
tioned, however, by four informants that Subject's father
was suspected of having pro-German leanings during World
War #1, but these suspicions were not verified by the
informants. Persons interviewed vouched for Subject's
father's loyalty at the time of the investigation.
It was noted that Subject's Personal History
Statement dated February 16, 1943 indicates that he was
natalo 30,
hawn
tigation verified the fuct, however, that Subject was born
in Chihuahua, Mexico on October 30, 1915.
In a casual conversation with another of-
ficer, Subject volunteered the following information with
respect to records of his birthplace. Subject stated that
he had no birth certificate and had moved from Chihuahua
Nexico to El Paso, Texas, with his parents, when he was.
one or two years of age. Subject stated that he had never
inquired about, nor realized that he was born in Chihuaina
until he was in high school, having previously presumed tist
he was born in the locale in which is childhood was spent)
Viz; Willcox, Arizona.
Subject stated further that he gave his
birthplace as Willmox, Arizona on his application for en-
listment in ROTC to eliminate conflict with any previous
records which would then require at of "red tape" in
making what he considered then a minor discrepancy of no
consequence, inasmuch as his father's naturalization auto-
matically made him (Subject) a citizen of the United States.
-T
It was the opinion of the officer making the
above report on Subject's birthplace; that any conflicting.
records of Subject's birthplace was not due to any motives
of subterfuge, but was most probably due to Subject's desire
to expedite his entrance into college without oncountering:

11 May 1954
1. A representative of this Division recently contacted subject,
a US manufacturers' representative, who lives in Mexico City. Wichtrich
was visiting representatives of the Nehi Corporation which is one of his
accounts in Mexico City. After our representative made his standard ex➤
planation of Agency interests, wichtich said that he felt that he should
make it clear that is vorked for the Agency in Mexico. He qualified this
statement by saying wat is extensive back round and experience in Mexico
enabled Lia to set up meeting places and "front" offices as well as other
"cover" projects for this Agency, the State Department and the Bureau.
2. He seemed quite candid and our representative had no reason to
believe that he was not welling we truth. ■icatrich courted that he
could give us a great deal of information which was not available through
official agencies operating in Mexico. However, he seems to be generally
knowledgeable on the situation there and we believe that be night be:
a source of some interesting information if our contacting him would not
interfere with arrangements which the covert offices might have made with
him.
3. We should appreciate your comments. If you prefer, we shall not
see him again. On the other hand, if you have no objection, we should lika -
to contact him when he returns to this country in July. Flease advise.
