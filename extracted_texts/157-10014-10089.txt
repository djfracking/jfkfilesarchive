by any means limited to that, that we were in trouble finding
means which appeared secure, particularly means which kept the
U.S. hand hidden. It is the to and from, and the atmosphere
of it which is very familiar to me; the details of it, much of
it even on reading them, is rather unfamiliar to me. I found
no surprises in it.
Mr. Baron.
Having refreshed your recollection by reviewing
these cables, can you add any greater specificity to the record
1 about the substance of your conversations with Richard Bissell
11 on the possibility of assassinating Lumumba ?
Mr. Twasdy. I think what we used to do, as I remember it,
when it came to the technical exchange with the Station on one
asset versus another, the possible security weakness of this
man versus the possible strengths of another, Bissell left this
largely to me. I do not mean to say that we did not from time
to time review it. He did not debate with me on whether White
Clam lu was somebody who was worth dealing with or not, because
The had Belgian connections, for example.

(Discussion off the record.)
Mr. Baron. Back on the record on this subject.
Mr. Tweedy. No, I do not have any further recollection of
detailed discussions with Bissell on this. On the other hand,
it was perfectly clear that he remained actively interested in
it. I am sure that he was the one that had the idea of Justin
O'Donnell, for example, I think he undoubtedly came up with
that idea. As you recall, I had forgotten entirely that Justin
O'Dornell
O'Do nall had ever played a role in this. I am sure when he
fixed on O'Donnell the possibility to assist the thief of Statics
15 he must have discussed this with him. I can almost say I
remember it, but hardly.
Mr. Baron.
Do you have any recollection of what Bissell
said to you in the series of discussions on the prospect of
assassinating Lumumba about the level at which the exploration
of this prospect had been authorized?

Mr. Tweedy. Let me make it quite clear, he certainly
never mentioned the President at all.
Mr. Baron. By name?
Mr. Tweedy.
By name, or even by any indication.
It was

assassination discussed with him at all, I cannot comment on.

It is perfectly obvious that the Agency felt that it had

Mr. Baron. Were there any other meetings that you recall
between yourself and Richard Bissell where he asked you to
move beyond the exploratory stage to the implementation stage
in assassinating Lumumba?
Mr. Tweedy. I do not know at all. I just do not recall
that that ever occurred.

Mr. Baron. Yes.

Mr. Tweedy. I have the most unclear recollection that I

with Mr. Gottliaby himself, although I am quite convinced I had
them.

Mr. Tweedy.
That, I do not recall. I can only assume
that Sidney Gottlieb would have discussed with the Chief of
_ Station instruments which TSD might have which could be of
assistance in an assassination attempt. I assumed he discussed
his inventory, whatever it might be, and the two presumably ware
trying to come to some conclusions as to what might have the
best chance or the most practical chance of being used.
This is my assumption. I think in this early stage, that
would have been the purpose of the exercise.
Mr. Baron. Let me represent to you the testimony of Sidney

before he undertook the mission to the Congo in September of

Quite common.
Throughout the organization
on matters of either particular sensitivity or so important that

a subject, the Chief of the Division would originate and
send out cables and have it actually signed off by the DDP.
That was quite a common practice in the Agency.
Mr. Baron. Do you have a recollection, having seen this
document, of the fact that you set up a special channel using
the YQPROP sensitivity indicator?
Mr. Tweedy. I did not recall Y PROP, but I recall special

Mr. Gottllab also testified that in that conversation you

Did that conversation take place?

Mr. Tweedy. His testimony does not basically refresh my
memory. The only aspect of it which I would find unrealistic is
that he had an instruction from me to tell the Chief of Station
to use this material and no ahead and assassinate Lumumba,
if, in effact, that is all the authority that was necessary.
To be frank, that does not make sense. The rest of it is
perfectly feasible. I do not recall it in the detail, but I

that I told him, in effect, to go to the Chief of Station and

way it would have happened.
Mr. Baron. Why is that?
Mr. Tweedy. For the simple reason that under no circumstances

Mr. Tweedy. If he says so, I do not disagree with him.
I do not frankly recall that at this point, but I am perfectly
wadded to accept what he says.
Mr. Baron. Assuming, for the moment, that you would have
required the Chief of Station to check back with Headquarters
before he carried out an assassination mission, would it be
true that vou assigned Dr. Gottlis the task of instructing
the Chief of Station to assassinate Lumumba on that basis?
Mr. Tweedy. Dr. Gottlich was the head of the Technical
Services Division, or whatever it was called in those days.
Mr. Baron. Let me jump in for a moment.
At this point, for about a year and a half, he was the
Science Advisor to Mr. Bissell, and he moved to Technical

Services shortly thereafter.
Mr. Tweedy. The way you put it to me was that I instructed.
Gottlieb to assassinate Lumumba.
The answer to that is, I am
sure I never instructed Gottlieb
I never instructed Gottlieb to assassinate Lumumba. This
is the way you put it to me.
Mr. Baron. Let me correct that.

What I meant to say was, would you have asked Gottlieb

to convey the instruction to the Chief of Station that he was

Mr. Tweedy. My answer to that is almost certainly not.
That would have been covered in other correspondence, which I
think is demonstrated by these cables, to the Chief of Station
direct from me with authority of Mr. Bissell. I would not have
used, neither would Mr. Bissell, Mr. (Cobas the channel

Mr. Baron. Dr. Gottlieb has also testified that, aside
from carrying the materials to the Chief of Station and
instructing in their use and giving him an instruction about a
mission to assassinate Lumumba, that he had one further role
in the Congo; he was to serve as a technical advisor to the
Chief of Station on the feasibility of using these biological
substances to carry off the operation.

with his technical knowledge of the nature of these materials
he would be in a position to either comment on or advise the

operation.
That makes good sense to me.
He would require,' basically, a technical advisor.
Mr. Baron. Dr. Gottlieb also testified that the materials
he took with him were of a fairly short life. Their toxicity
would wane within a matter of weeks.
Given that bit of information to refresh your recollection,
does that make it more likely that Gottlieb was there, to aid
the Chief of Station in actually carrying off the administration
of these drugs, as opposed to giving him general instructions
in the use of such lethal substances?
Mr. Tweedy. I do not know really that I can comment on
that. If the materials would deteriorate fast, the use of the
if possible, I would stress the latter, would necessarily have
to be expeditied, but the overwhelming concern of Headquarters
and the field, again, demonstrated in this correspondence was
our concern that this thing could be done at all, that it be
done right, securely, and that the U.S. hand should be
concealed.

think that would have just been too bad. But I think it is
perfectly clear that we would not have expedited anything at
the risk of doing it unprofessionally.
22
Mr. Baron. At the point that Gottlieb; left for the Congo
after talking with you, would he have been enpowered to convey
to the Chief of Station that an assassination of Lumumba could
be carried off if he could meet the criteria you just laid out,
concealment of the U.S. hand and use of these materials before
their potency waned?
Mr. Tweedy. My answer to that would be he would be in 10
position to do anything more with the Chief of Station if they
reached that point in planning, that as of the last time he
17 was at leadquarters that there would probably be an approval

from Washington.
Mr. Baron. You would expect, then, the Chief of Station
would have been expected to reconfirm with Headquarters the
fact that he had a go-ahead?
Mr. Tweedy. It would never have occurred to me otherwise.
Mr. Baron. It would be your testimony that, although you
do not specifically recall your conversation with Dr. Gottliah
you would have made that clear to Dr. Coffligh?
Go
Mr. Tweedy. I would have thought so, yes, but I could not
comment any further.

the Congo which would lead you to believe that it had previously

In our business, these
things were done by operational planning, at which point one
came up with an operation that was agreed upon by the Station
and by Headquarters, and this, then, would have been either
implemented or not, according to the say-so from leadquarters.
Mr. Dawson. That kind of operational planning is

The interesting aspect of that sentence for me is the
rest of the sentence where it makes it clear that not only is
there a concern about Lumumba being able to resume his position
in Leopoldville, but anywhere else, and it would seem that
assassination would at least have to be one of very few means
that could insure that fact that Lumumba would not resume a
position of power anywhere.
Mr. Tweedy. I do not think I can comment any furthar.
Mr. Baron.. Let us introduce as Exhibit 5 a cable

discussions should be on hypothetical basis.” And, of

that I had with a very professional Chief of Station. That is
all.
Mr. Baron. Doas not the paragraph A here indicate that
the objective of the mission that was discussed in the YQPROP
channel was to assassinate Lumumba in view or in light of the
fact that Gottlieby had gone to the Congo with materials that
were only going to be lethal for a short period of time?
Mr. Tweedy. That is what it says.
Mr. Baron. In other words, what I am trying to explore
with you is your characterization of this entire stage of the
1 operation as one of planning and exploration when we know that
Gottlieb took materials to the Congo which would only be lethal
for a short period of time and presumably was prepared to move

from exploration to implementation?

Mr. Tweedy. If, as a result of the Station focusing on
the problem for the first time, as a result of Haadquarters'
request, they had come up with a plan that they thought was
axceedingly solid and which Headquarters approved, it is not
surprising, perhaps, that we wanted the materials there to take
advantage of such, if you like, an unlikely event. But this
would not change the normal sequence of events, which would be
that the Station would explore, keen Headquarters informed,
Headquarters would comment, it would then be a cresendo of

O'Donnell's account

Bissell to go to the Congo to carry off the assassination of
Lumumba would fit here?
Mr. Tweedy.

Mr. Baron. The third country national referred to in this
10 cable and in other cables as someone you are considering
dispatching to the Congo to help with the operation, would that
be QJWIN or WIROGUB?

QJWIN was the agent who was supervised by Justin O'Donnell.

Let us proceed to review a set of documents which were not
available to us in your first examination.
The attempt here
today is not to go over a lot of old ground that we covered
in your first examination but to focus our concerns on a few
E main events in the alleged story of an assassination plot
14
16 against Lumumba, and to refresh your recollection by review of
17
these documents.
Let me introduce as Exhibit 1 a cable from Allen Dulles
to the Leopoldville Station, marked for Robert Guthman on
: October 26th, 1960.

Is that consistent with your recollection?
Mr. Tweekly. No, it is not consistent with my recollection.
It is certainly consistent with what I read the last time I saw
you, which I have no reason to dispute. I just cannot remember
the blighter at all.
Mr. Baron. As Exhibit 10, let us introduce a cable of
October 15th, 1960, which is not sent in the YOPROP channel.

In paragraph C, there is a reference to MEROAK.
Mr. Tweedy, we have received the representation from the
CIA that that was a cryptonym used to refer to Lumumba.
Is that consistent with your intereptation of the cable?
Mr. Baron. It is indeed.
Mr. Tweedy. This paragraph C says in part: "Only direct
action we can now stand behind is to support immobolizing or
02

Any action taken would have to be entirely Congolese.”
Now, you signed this cable, but it was not sent in the
special sensitivity channel that dealt with Gottlieb's mission
to the Congỗ
Before we discuss this cable, let us also introduce into

Let us introduce as the final exhibit for

Jadwin from the Chief of Station.
In this cable, the Chief of Station is responding to your
suggestion that a senior case officer might be dispatched to
the Congo to handle the Ŷ PROP operation.

Mr. Tweedy. I think that is accurate.
We had come to the end of the road, at least-temporarily
on the YQPROP aspect and for the time being we were in no
position to approve anything but what was discussed in the
02
5
IFLAP cable.

Nonetheless, as long as the threat to the Congo
from Lumumba existed, there remained a high priority to search
for means to take care of the YOPROP planning aspects.
Mr. Baron. When the cable refers to the specific purpose
you discussed with colleague
Mr. Tweedy. This is assassination with Gottlieb, I am

Would that not indicate to the Chief of Station

Mr. Tweedy. What this would mean to the Chief of Station
was that he should retain exploration of possible means of
assassinating Lumumba as highest priority. He should continue
to seek means to do this, not to do it.
Mr. Baron. Again, you are maintaining you have just made
yourself clear, as far as you were concerned, you were still
asking him to explore and not implement at this point?
Mr. Tweedy.
Nothing als but.

Mr. Baron. This contains the following language: "You

will probably receive more along these lines as stumbling

Congo situation closely and his disposition spontaneously
becomes number one consideration."
Mr. Tweedy. I think by that, I think it is perfectly God-

awful English.
10
Mr. Baron.
The cabla continues
1:
Mr. Tweedy.
Obviously that means that everyone one talked
12
to said there is no solution to the Congo as long as Lumumba
1
stays in a position of power or influence there. That is what
14 that means.
Mr. Baron. The cable continues:
"Raise above so you not
16
confused by any apparent duplication.
This channel remains
17
i.
for specific purpose you discussed with colleague and also
remains highest priority."
Now, does this pair of cables indicate that at this point.
despite the indication in the first cable that we looked at that
"direct action would be limited to entirely Congolese action"
the actual position of yourself and others at Headquarters
involved in this operation was that exploration of an assassing-
tion mission remained the highest priority for the Chief of

Mr. Baron. The Chief of Station then makes a suggestion

it could be more clear-cut than that. This was basically, this
was the formal expression of that by the Director himself.
I cannot remember which came first, did I see this cable
first, or did I talk to Mr. Bissall first. I suspect that I
