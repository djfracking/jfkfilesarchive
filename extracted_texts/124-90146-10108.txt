FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE
0
The April 6, 1960, edition of "The New York
Times" newspaper contained a full-page advertisement
captioned. "What Is Really Happening In Cuba," placed by
the Fair Play for Cuba Committee (FPCC). This advertise-
ment announced the formation of the FPCC in New York City
and declared the FPCC intended to promulgate "the truth
about revolutionary Cuba" to neutralize the distorted
American press.
"The New York Times" edition of January 11,
1961, reported that at a hearing conducted before the
United States Senate Internal Security Subcommittee on
January 10, 1961, Dr. CHARLES A. SANTOS-BUCH identified
himself and ROBERT TABER as organizers of the FPCC. He
also testified he and TABER obtained funds from the Cuban
Government which were applied toward the cost of the afore-
mentioned advertisement. 4.
On May 16, 1963, a source advised that during
the first two years of the FPCC's existence there was a
struggle between Communist Party (CP) and Socialist Workers
Party (SWP) elements to exert their power within the FPCC
and thereby influence FPCC policy. This source added that
during the past year there had been a successful effort by
FPCC leadership to minimize the role of these and other
organizations in the FPCC so that their influence as of
May, 1963, was negligible.
The SWP has been designated pursuant to
Executive Order 10450.
On May 20, 1963, a second source advised that
VINCENT "TED" LEE, FPCC National Office Director, was then
formulating FPCC policy and had indicated that he had no
intention of permitting FPCC policy to be determined by
any other organization. This source stated that LEE
believed that the FPCC should advocate resumption of
diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States
and should support the right of Cubans to manage their
revolution without interference from other nations. LEE
did not advocate supporting the Cuban revolution per se.

APPENDIX
FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE
The November 23, 1963, edition of "The New York
Times" reported that Senator THOMAS J. DODD of Connecticut
had called FPCC "the chief public relations instrument of
the CASTRO network in the United States." It is to be noted
that Senator DODD was a member of the Senate Internal Security
Subcommittee which twice conducted hearings on the FFCC.
u
The December 27, 1963, edition of "The New York
World Telegram and Sun" newspaper stated that the pro-
CASTRO FPCC was seeking to go out of business and that
its prime activity during its lifetime had been sponsor-
ship of pro-CASTRO street rallies and mass picket lines,
and the direction of an active propaganda mill highlighting.
illegal travel-to-Cuba campaigns. Its comparatively brief
span of life was attributed to mounting anti-CASTRO American
public opinion, the 1962 Congressional hearings which dis-
closed FPCC financing by CASTRO's United Nations Delegation,
and ultimately, the bad publicity which the FFCC received
from disclosure of activities on its behalf by suspected
presidential assassin, LEE H. OSWALD.
On February 6, 1964, the previously mentioned
second source advised that V. T. LEE had recently remarked
that the PPCC was dead and that there were no plans to
organize another similar organization.
1
u
On April 13, 1964, a third source advised that
there had not been any FPCC activity in many months and
that the FPCC had been dissolved.

Although GIBSON's previous activities would
warrant retention on the SI, it is felt that inasmuch
as GIBSON has been debriefed by CIA and is presently
being operated by CIA, GIBSON no longer warrants inclusion
on the SI, and accordingly it is being recommended that
the name of RICHARD THOMAS GIBSON be deleted from the
SI.
