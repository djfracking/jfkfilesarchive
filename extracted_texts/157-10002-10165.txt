Mr. Phillips. Senator, it doesn't make any difference
'
today. On the contrary, since Watergate the people say, why
should we? Before Watergate it was another ball game.
The President was the Commander in Chief in every sense of the
word.
And you said, who am I, a GS-15 bureaucrat, to say that
we shouldn't do this? But that has changed since Watergate.
One other question.
Senator Hart of Colorado.
I call your attention in our briefing books to what is
Tab C, a cable which has your name at the end of it dated 21
September 1970, page 3 of 7. Are you an author or co-author
of that cable?
Mr. Phillips. I believe I was the authenticating
officer, yes.
Senator Hart of Colorado. What does that mean?
Mr. Phillips. That meant that the signature on the
right of those cables is someone that is the authenticating
officer in a sense, here is a fellow that is supposed to know
the situation.
Senator Hart of Colorado. But who wrote it, I guess
is what I am after.
Mr. Phillips. I would guess that this cable was probably
written by Mr. Poinzio, and perhaps myself, perhaps it was
joint. But Mr. Poinzio wrote an awful lot of them. But by

Chile and what was happening there, would be concerned.
Salvadore Allende made his first statement saying that
he was a Socialist and wanted to change the order some 32
years beforehe was elected.
Over the years he made it quite clear that he was an ar-
dent socialist. Before this decision was made I believe that
we had a visit from a man who had the code name of Ariel, he
was a Cuban intelligence officer. The Cubans were moving in
rapidly. The influence was great. I think that they saw a lot
at stake, another Cuba in Latin America type of thing, the
same thing perhaps that motivated President Johnson to send
22,000 rather than 400.
So, I can understand why they thought this was going,
in the long strategic sense, in the long range against our
interests.
But that is an assumption.
It is true that Allende very definitely made it clear
that he wanted to turn Chile into a Marxist state. The differ-
14

ence was that Allende refused to take Fidel Castro's advice
and use violence. As I understand it, Fidel Castro went to
Chile and said, if you want your revolution to last you are
going to have to use violence.

Mr. Phillips.
No, sir. I was (the Station Chief in
»Rio de Janiero in Brazil, and was called back in 1970 for
six or seven weeks for what we are referring to as Track II.
Senator Mondale. Now, in that position you familiarized
yourself with the Chilean government, Allende and so on,
and tried to become as expert as you could in the political
forces and so on?
Mr. Phillips. Yes. And in addition to that, Senator,
one of the reasons I was called back was that I had lived
for many years in Chile, so I knew something about it.
Senator Mondale. And it is your judgment as I think I
just heard, that although Allende was a Marxist, and espoused
Marxism, he also said he wanted to achieve this through the
democratic process, and although there was some rough stuff
on the press, and so on, essentially that was the course he
was pursuing, is that correct?
Mr. Phillips.
I don't recall that he said it, but
he indeed acted that way.
Senator Mondale. But in fact the course he was pur-

Senator Hart of Colorado. It must have caught your eye,

Mr. Phillips. It did catch my eye. If this was indeed
a joint venture, I can promise that that was Dino Poinzio's
contribution, and if you ever meet him you will understand
why.
He was addicted to picturesque speech. And looking
back, all I can say is that it probably went out at four
o'clock in the morning, and we were very tired, and I just
didn't want to argue about that phrase, and I let it go. I
am not sure what it means even now.

Now, I read that as Helms' position being that the
assassination of Schneider was something which presented the
opportunity for the very thing that the U.S. wished to have
done.
Do you agree with me?
Mr. Phillips. No, I can't agree with you on that.
I am
not sure about the suggestion from the language. But I will
tell you the immediate reaction in our little task force when
the word came that Schneider was dead, that is it, it is finishe

it, there will be no more. In many countries in Latin America
that would have been the signal for further action, weakness,
and so forth. But in this case it was the end of the
business.
Mr. Schwarz. I want to run through with you the activi-
ties which were being undertaken with the Valenzuela group
and with the Viaux group. In the case of Viaux, was that one
of the assignments that the false flag officers had?
Mr. Phillips. Yes.
Mr. Schwarz. And in the case of Valenzuela, was that
one of the assignments that Colonel Wimert had?

carried out on October 19. The Huerth, who was head of the
Carabineros, witting of the above plan, has promised to keep
the Carabineros away from the Schneier houseto assure that the
abduction will not be interferred with. General Viaux is
knowledgeable of the above operation, but is not directly
involved."
What do you think "not directly involved" refers to?
Why not just not involved?
Mr. Phillips. I think that probably referred to what
I was saying before, that in these situations it is not very
unusual that there is not some talk that everybody has a cousin
that works with some group type of thing.
And I believe that it must refer to that.
Mr. Schwarz.
Taking the actual cable, is the actual
cable in the Senator's books?
16
Mr. Inderfurther.
No.

directly involved.
He has been sent to Vina to stay with
prominent physician. Will be seen in public places during 19
and 20 October to demonstrate fact that above operation is
not his doing. Will be allowed to return to Santiago at end of

Now, I can't read that language any way other than
meaning that the Valenzuela group and the Viaux group were in
close cooperation, that was part of the abduction plan, it
was agreed between the two that Viaux would appear would
be out of town so that he would not appear to be involved.
And you have to read that, do you not, as meaning that there
was a close cooperation on this effort between the two groups.
Mr. Phillips. Yes, I think you do have to read it that
way.

Mr. Phillips. Yes, to address this point specifically.
Obviously when the guns were passed through Colonel Winert.
and the death occurred so soon after, immediately we
thought they probably used those guns. It was then when we
read the press reports that General Schneider died from hand-
gun wounds. And that was the first time we thought we could

by Dianne LaVoy under October 18 there is reference to a cable
A66 dated October 19. And concerning the connection of
these various conspirators, it says: "Valenzuela meets with

Go ahead.
Picking up on Senator Schweiker's line
of quesioning, would you show the witness Tab A, the docu-
ment Tab A.
It is a memorandum for the record by Mr. Broe dated 17
September, and then that is crossed out and it says 16 Sep-
tember, "Subject, Genesis of Project".
Incidentally, what was the code name for this project?
Was it FU Belt?

Mr. Phillips.
Beltway or FU Belt, one of the two.
Mr. Schwarz. Does FU stnd for anything in particular?
Mr. Phillips. Chile. So it would be FU. The first two
letters there indicate a geographical araa. So it would be a
16 lot of different ones, but that would mean Chile. FU Belt
15
means Chile. Belt means nothing

Mr. Phillips.
I believe the explanation for that was
the fact that Colonel Wimert had been around Latin America,
spoke perfect Spanish, his hobby was riding horses, and he
developed really marvelous relationships with the military of
officers that he had contact with. And I think it was just
that someone recognized the fact that if we had been given the
task of getting a coup going using the military, why not take
advantage of the one man in Chile that they liked the most,
trusted the most, and saw the most? It was perfectly natural
for him to spend his weekends with these people.
Mr. Schwarz. And so he was a natural and helpful asset.
But how was it arranged that he would work for the CIA, and
lay that question against the instruction from President
Nixon that the Defense Department was not to know, how did

Having seen that, and these changes, what
do you recall about the circumstances that led you to make
those changes?
Mr. Phillips. It is possible that this message is one
of the rare messages that sometimes occur, that you are handed
something that is written out, and there is no secretary,
and it is two o'clock in the morning or something like that.
On some occasions you will take a very rough draft and ask

wasn't aware of this.
Mr. Schwarz. After that initial occasion involving
the use of Philpott's name in order to instruct Wimert to
work for the CIA, was anybody from the Defense Intelligence
Agency further brought into the operation which we have been
calling Track II?
Mr. Phillips.
My answer to that until a few minutes
ago would have been, I don't recall that. I have seen a document
since then that indicates that someone else was talked to
later. If I knew that I had forgotten it, or perhaps never
knew it
I must have known it if I saw the message.But
until I saw this thing, to refresh my memory I would have
said, I think that Philpott was the man.
Mr. Schwarz. Was the man, and was only contacted on
that one occasion?

I am not sure about that.
Mr. Schwarz. You think what you sent used General Ben-
nett's name and not General Philpott's name?
Mr. Phillips. I don't recall. But I believe if that had
been the case that not only would the change have been made,
but there would have been some sort of note on the side or
something. So, I believe that the original must have said
Philpott.
But I can't be absolutely positive.
Mr. Schwarz. But the original typed version on the
first page used Bennett's name, right?
Mr. Phillips. Yes.
Mr. Schwarz. Now, I am puzzled, because if you had
previously obtained the document which is Exhibit 3, the
"suggested message to be sent to Army attache from General
17
Bennett", and which is in fact signed with a name that
18

before drafting the typed message, I take it you would have used

Mr. Schwarz.
And this is a cable releasing officer Willia
Broe, authenticating officer David A Phillips, dated Octo-
ber 14, 1970, from CIA headquarters to Santiago, CIA.
And it says:
"Please deliver the following message ('destroy immedi-
ately') to Colonel Wimert eyes only from Lieutenant General
Bennett.
##
Now, on what basis did you authenticate that message
which purports to be to Colonel Wimert from Lieutenant General
10
Bennett?
11
Mr. Phillips.
Obviously
not obviously, but because

there was a document that was handed to me and I was told,

send this down. In order to make this point, I was in there,
and it was sort of a direct operational thing, and when I
authenticated them I did it because I knew what was going on.
If Bill Broe, my boss, came in and said, here is a document
that we want to send, or if Tom Karamessines said, I worked on
the assumption that they were passing on to me the authority
to authenticate, and I didn't necesarily turn to them and say,

is the fact that it was actually drafted by someone

here, I cleared this with Broe, and so he signed both things.

Mr. Schwarz.
Let's take some of the statements that
are in the telegram and deal with them specifically.
Paragraph 2: "There seems little doubt this will
confuse Colonel Wimert
It has confused all of us here, so I suppose it would
have confused him.
"Background for his information: both Generals Bennett
and Philpott have been briefed by Broe".
Who told you that?
Mr. Phillips.. I don't know for sure, but I presume
this must have been Bill Broe.
Mr. Schwarz. Do you have any recollection of his telling
you that?
Mr. Phillips. I do not. But I don't think that I
I don't see myself releasing that cable without being sure that
Broe knew what was going out in that cable. In other words,
that is hthe kind of cable that I wouldn't have released
just because someone else came in and said that sort of thing.
This cable I think must have originated either with a dis-
cussion with Broe that said, look, send the following word,
write up something like this, or perhaps some notes, and say,
do a cable from it, or just as possible
and I can't read it

or the other which would enable you to form a judgment as

00
the question as to what kind of an explicit order would be
necessary in order to justify Agency actions to actually
assassinate some one.
Mr. Phillips. No, because I never heard Mr. Helms even
get that close to the edge of such talk about such and such an
option or possibility, I never heard him talk that way.
Mr. Schwarz. Did you ever hear anybody in the Agency
9
10
talk that way?
11
Mr. Phillips.
Under traumatic conditions I have heard
12
human beings maybe with a few drinks or something like that

saying, my God, we would be better off if so and so were
bumped off or something.

But I have never heard two officers sit down and

said that, it is the same way some people might get out of line
and say almost anything.
Mr. Schwarz. Did you ever hear, in connection with
the Chile operation, that certain Chilean officers, specifi-
cally a Major Marshall, reported to the CIA that they intended
to assassinate Allende?
Mr. Phillips. It was five years ago. But as I recall,
Major Marshall said a number of things. He was what I think
of as a wild man. I seem to recall something about, yes, a

it would appear that there might be something here where they
are going to bring in more people, as is known to several per-

And itmay have been because there was an attempt there

on them. Even though I signed them and so forth, I wasn't
paying the attention to things that I did to my own job.
That is an explanation that deals with
some of the earlier documents. But here in the first place
you were both the releasing officer and the authenticating
officer.
And second, this is not simply taking some other message
and putting a heading on it, is it? This is a substantive
document purporting to explain a problem to your CIA Station
Chief in Santiago, right, do you agree with that?
Mr. Phillips. I do. And I agree that it is puzzling,

that sort of thing, and was perhaps slightly embarrassed
by the fact that they had been doing that before. That is the
only explanation I can give.
Mr. Schwarz.
So you would assume that these new
interested parties and the several persons referred to in
the two sentences are persons who were in higher authority
than Bennett and Philpott?
Mr. Phillips. I assume that, but do not know. I just
this thing was being so closely held, it just doesn't seem
logical to me that they would start going outside and down,
I thought that they would go outside and up. But I say, I
only assume that.

Mr. Schwarz. The CIA had been using Wimert, and knew
some people in higher authority than General Bennett, which

would mean very senior in the Defense Department, right?

of it, General Bennett and General Philpott feel that they are
embarrassed to refute the fact that they had already been doing
the work for the CIA through Colonel Wimert,
Now, all those things were not ordinary garden variety
daily events, were they?
Mr. Phillips. They were not.
Mr. Schwarz. You don't remember this at all?
Mr. Phillips. No, and I didn't want to imply that it
was necessarily because General Philpott would have been
embarrassed, it could have been within CIA as well.
But this rather unusual step was made because of the
talents of the military men, to bring him into a program
that you weren't even talking with the State Department about.
And so that indeed was unusual to a great degree. And I am
really very sorry to appear to be so vague about these things
that I obviously had something to do with.
But my explanation is that I was doing a certain job,
and that other people were outside, and Mr. Karamessines would
be talking with Mr. Helms about something, and this, that and
the other, and I was on the day-by-day operation side, and when
someone would come in and say, we want something to go down
to Wimert, and it has something to do with General Philpott,
I didn't pay the kind of attention I would to it if it had
been one of our operations.

Mr. Schwarz. Can you tell from the face of it, are we
correct that this is a document that was sent from the CIA
station in Santiago to CIA headquarters purporting to come
from Colonel Wimert and purporting to be directed to Lieutenant
General Bennett?
Mr. Phillips. That is true.
Mr. Schwarz.
In the ordinary course to whom would
such a cable go? And the second question, who would have the
responsibility of passing information on to General Bennett?
Mr. Phillips. In the ordinary course of events this cable
11 would have come to me where I was working in the sense of an

The action on this cable would have certainly have gone

this is his message to the head of another government
service. And so it would have gone to that level.
Mr. Schwarz.
And in the ordinary course it would have
come to you first, and then it would have been passed on to
either Mr. Broe or someone higher to take action?
Mr. Phillips. For action not always. Sometimes a
cable will come in and there will be more than one copy.
And right away the action copy will go to the other fellow, and
then you get the information copy, and so forth.
Mr. Schwarz.
Can you tell from the face of this cable
whether there would have been more than one copy?

Mr. Schwarz. And you don't remember from where you got

Mr. Phillips. I do not. Perhaps I can be more helpful

Does the "eyes only"have any significance
to you in the third line?
Mr. Phillips. Only in the sense that what Colonel
Wiment was saying was, this may go over to the Defense Depart-
ment, but not through regular channels, and not to anyone else
other than General Bennett.

Mr. Schwarz.
Did it go to General Bennett?
10
Mr. Phillips. I do not know.

Mr. Schwarz.
And did you pass it to someone?
12
Mr. Phillips. If it did not go it would have been
13 highly unusual for a message to come in from overseas saying,

Mr. Schwarz. What would be the normal form of its

Mr. Phillips. It would have probably been folded
into an envelope and delivered by hand. Because if it is
really an "eyes only" message of such import, if it goes
through a communications channel, it means that they are going
to be operators of machinery to see it, and so forth. If
an American Ambassador overseas wants to get a very sensitive
message up he has the option of sending it to us and saying,
will you please hand carry this over to the Secretary of State?

plans. I can't recall that they said they needed them spe-
cifically for the kidnapping. I do recall that the reason was
the automatic reaction from Latin America is, why do people
need arms when they have got arms everywhere all over Latin
America.
And they said something about, their own arms could be
identified, and they needed some that couldn't be identified.
I don't recall if it was specifically mentioned that it was
just for that. It was certainly understood that they might

to die.
Miss Culbreth. You had served as Chief of Station in
the Dominican Republic prior to the time that you served in
this position on the Track II party?
Mr. Phillips.
I have, after the assassination of
Trujillo. But as a student of Latin America, I was very much
aware of this. So, there is another aspect of involvement.
U.S. policy has been to retreat from Trujillo. We cut off our
arms aid, we brought our Ambassador out of there. So, while
those plans were going on we weren't "dealing with a friendly
16 nation", relations were very bad.

The death of General Schneider had occurred. And while,

to "plan", an egregious plan, it was absolutely my conviction
that those orders that I had been predicting, which were very,
very slim, were now completely unacceptable, one reason being
that the inauguration was going to be in 48 hours not the
inauguration, but the confirmation, and so forth.
And so as I recall, there was a meeting of quite a few
of us, probably myself and
ionzio and Mr. Broe and Mr.
no, I guess not, but
Karamessines, and maybe Mr. Flannery,
I do remember thatmeeting going up there and saying, if there
ever was a chance, it is now finished, and somebody has got to
say that it is finished. And so that is what I meant by that

that moment began cooperating with the Chief of Station. I don't
recall any instance where there was any indication of hesitancy
on his part about doing what he was doing.
And I certainly can't comment about General Bennett's
side, not having been involved with him.
From the CIA side I suppose it is conceivable that some-
one is using that business that I referred to in dispatches,
General Bennett says, when they are really talking about
what a subordinate of General Bennett says, and they figure
he is acting for them, or something like that. I guess that
is conceivable.
But I would find it very unusual to see some sort of
little plot hatched here, because there was no need to.

Talking about telephones, incidentally,
was there a secure telephone between Washington and Santiago
which was used for messages, or did you use the cable always?
Mr. Phillips. We never used the telephone, unless it is
a personal message like your aunt died and you have to get on
the next plane for the funeral. Otherwise you use those
absolutely marvelous communications facilities that get it
down there --a flash cable will get there in 20 minutes.
In the recess I have been thinking about this, and I re-
alize that I have not been very helpful in what obviously is
a contradictory situation here. As I read it, either General
Bennett does not recall this, or else there was some sort of
14 endeavor within CIA headquarters to use his name. Is that
the approach we are making to this?

potential which cannot be done by station personnel or any
Chilean. An example: We have a Canadian who can pose as

ran a Chilean general, any flap would be a Brazilian one
In the second paragraph which was not read earlier,
I would like to read this and then put a question to you:
"Headquarters believes this false flag base, manned by
officers who have repeatedly proved their ability to operate
and recruit under false colors, will give station great
flexibility in handling delicate and fast-moving situations :
securely".
To me this second paragraph indicates that these false
flag officers were people that had experience in this very
kind of intelligence operations, is that correct?

And had been in this kind of capacity
Mr. Phillips. Yes.
Miss Culbreth.
So, this was not some unique and unusual
devious approach or mechanism that was being employed in this
instance?
Mr. Phillips. The purpose of that explanation, es-
pecially the second paragraph that you read, was
the imme-
diate reaction, as I recall, from the station when they first
heard that we were given their assignment, was, come on,
that flap potential is great, it is not going to work, what
are you talking about, this, that and the other.
As a matter of fact, as I recall, Henry Hecksher, the
Station, was terribly upset, because he is a sort of
an old pro, and he wanted to get into position, in other words,
to plan for the future, and all of a sudden this new thing

This is a cable, Mr. Phillips, dated September 27, 1970,

15
the Station in Chile, and it contains the following about the

Mr. Phillips. We call it a base.
Mr. Schwarz. False flag bases: "Each member of base
will enter and leave Chile with falst documents and operate as

a representative of his country rather than as anAmerican".
That is right, isn't it?
22
23

"Having at least one key Brazilian and one key Argentinian

and when General Viaux was called off earlier in October, I
thought that General Viaux was out of the thing, and I thought
that without support that he wasn't going to try anything.
And then we had the other group which seemed to be
more serious people, and with more capabilities. And I
very definitely regarded them as two separate groups.
Miss Culbreth. Let me ask just a few questions that
might sort of help us a little bit in our housekeeping opera-
tions when we get to the point of trying to tie everything up
on these.
With regard to the information that was given to you,
the specific instructions on these cables that were sent to the
Chief of Station and were directed to Colonel Wimert, who can

That is right, isn't it?

Mr. Schwarz. Continuing: "An example. We have can-
didates who can successfully pose as Brazilian intelligence
officers." You did that, didn't you?
Mr. Phillips. Yes.
Mr. Schwarz. And this goes on: "If he approached, funded

Mr. Phillips. Yes.
Mr. Schwarz. So the scheme was that not only would
the U.S. not be blamed, but other countries like Brazil would
be blamed if something went wrong.
Mr. Phillips. Yes, this is particularly sensitive to me,

Mr. Phillips. We do. And if there had been such a
man the Brazilians would be quite unhappy with us. But I
thought that was better than letting the world know that was

Mr. Schwarz. You go on in the cable of September 27
to say this:
"Headquarters believes this false flag was manned by
officers who have repeatedly proved their ability to operate
and recruit under false colors, will give Station great flexi-
bility in handling delicate and fast-moving situations secure-
ly."
So, the use of false flag persons, at least judging
from this cable, is something repeatedly done by the CIA?

Mr. Phillips. Yes, and by all intelligence services
not all, but all major intelligence services. If you are living
overseas and a man comes up to you and says, hey, I see you
are a Marxist, and a man comes up and says, I am from Havana
and we would like you to work with the Cuban intelligence

So, it is not an unusual practice.
Mr. Schwarz.
Incidentally, you just let drop one thing
in your testimony a moment ago. You said that in your 25-year
involvement with intelligence matters you had been bothered
by your activities on only two occasions, one of which was
Chile.
And then you said what the other one was. What was that?
Mr. Phillips. I was in Washington attending the Chiefs
of Station course, which is a training course for people who
are going out on their first assignment as Chief of Station.
When President Johnson decided to send 22,000 Marines
to the Dominican Republic, it occurred to me that in order to
protect and evacuate American citizens, that that job might
have been done with 400 Marines. I was scheduled to go there
as the Chief of Station. And I just wasn't sure that I
wanted to be associated with something like that. But I de-
cided, well, I suppose President Johnson knows what he is
