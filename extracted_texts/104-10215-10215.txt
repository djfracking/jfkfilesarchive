desire to here NUKASOID aign a new centrest. It is soppasted in this regørd
that you furnich as seen as measible any provisions which you vish to reacmant
for inclusion in the contrect, much recommendations will of cours be in con
formity with Sec. 31 of the Temilations governing contrect agents, not
carcer agents. It would be most adventegerus to submit such a contrect for
consideration stultemously with a request for removal of the operation st
the end of February 1952.
3. Melative to your question in peragraph ? of reference, of the
present time, TPS-11-655 is the current aproved version of the extent of
HUMANOID's corational activities. It is firmly believed that these restric
tions will be removed when, in February 1752, this operation will be considered
for renal by the staff which Umesed the curtailment. It is urged that in:
your quarterly review for the reriod ending 31 December 1951 you give Head.
quarters the benefit of another specific detailed report. At that time, wo
will also cetett a request for increased salary for HUMANOID.

HUMANOID-states that he is unable to devote sufficient time to the
business to keep it going without an assistant-and-that it would be
quite difficult-to-locate a competent workman at the salary level he
can afford to pay. The above facts, plus unfavorable findings of a
recent financial analysis of his business, have convinced HUMAROID.
to close the photograph shop at the end of November.
5. In connection with paragraph 2.d. of TRSW-685, which
states that HUMANOID must discontinue using his home to reproduce
the material obtained from HUMANKIND-1 and HUMANKIND-3, the following
brief history of safehouse experience at this station is set forth.
A review of the files and discussion with HUMANOID reveals that seven
safehouses have been utilized to date:
Hudiere
b.
I
An office room in the Panana Company building in San
José from June, 1959, to Rovember, 1949, used to process
HUMANKIND material. Abandoned when it was learned the
room was called the "FEI office upstairs" by other resi-
dents of the building.
An apartment in Bella Vista from November, 1949, to
January, 1950, used to process HUMANKIND material.
Abandoned because landlord lived next door and used
common entrance.
c. One-half of a house in San Pedro, which had private
entrance. Abandoned because the notorious Frank MARSHALL
was neighbor. MARSHALL is enemy of the Communist Party
and knew HUMANIST-2 by sight.
d.
An apartment in Parque Morazán. After two months this
was abandoned as neighbors began making inquiries con-
cerning infrequency of visits to the house.
e. Apartment in Barrio Luján, for four months.
This was
abandoned as many Party members lived nearby and knew
HUMANIST-2 by sight.
f. A house near the Sabana airport for seven months, used
to process HUMANKIND material.
premises caused speculation by neighbors and landlord.
Frequent vacancy of the
g. Photographic studio as discussed above. In addition to
stated reasons for closing above safehouses, two house
breakings were suffered, and it was frequently feared
that the reproduction equipment might be stolen when it
became apparent that persons were seldom in the houses.

1. TRSW-685, which advises that the expiration date of
this project-has-been-determined to be 29 February 1952, was
received several days after the forwarding of TRSA-1056, which
recommended that subject be considered for career agent status.
though TRSA-1056 furnished certain of the data requested by head-
quarters, the following additional information, queries and comments
are set forth with a view to facilitating a final evaluation of the
project.
2. Pursuant to the approval contained in TRSW-655,
dated June 29, 1951, HUMANOID has been and is currently acting as
cutout for HUMANIST-2, as well as for HUMANKIND-1 and HUMANKIND-3.
It is therefore not clear whether paragraph 2.b. of TRSA-685 is to be
interpreted as a new restriction on his activities which is to be placed
into effect at this time. In other words, is headquarters' approval
of the suggestions contained in TRSA-950 now withdrawn?
3. As discussed in TRSA-950, assistance was extended
HUMANOID in setting up a photography and photocopy shop on the fringe
of the downtown area. Funds formerly used for rental of a safehouse
were applied instead as rental for his photo shop, with the purpose
of providing a safe meeting place between HUMANOID and HUMANIST-2 and
to provide a more accessible spot for the processing of HUMANKIND
material. Early in July 1951, after two or three weeks experience
with photostating HUMANKIND material at the studio demonstrated the
unsuitability of the arrangement, HUMANOID resumed his photostatic
work in his own home. The studio has continued to serve as a meeting
place for HUMANIST-2. The following considerations entered into the
decision to discontinue processing HUMANKIND-1 and 3 material at the
photo studio: 1) The conspicuous nature of the equipment in a small
shop; 2) the security risks caused by the presence in the studio of
HUMANOID's local employee; and 3) the lack of any secure storage
space for compromising material

indicated in TRSA-1056 and TRSA-999, this arent has been living on a
very close financial marpin and has been aware of the recommended
raise for some months. It is conceivable that he_has_taken-the-raise
possibility into consideration in his personal financial arrangements.
In any event, should headquarters decide to terminate subject, it is
recommended that several months salary be authorized as a termination
bonus in order that there will be no likelihood of security consider-
ations arising from subject's possibly over-extended financial position.
This bonus payment is believed justified by subject's long tenure of
service.
8. With regard to paragraph 3 of TRSW-685, there have
been no changes in subject's cover and current modes of contact and
communication from those set out in TRSA-950. HUMANIST-2 makes a
weekly door-slot drop at night at the photographic studio, and a live
meeting takes place at the studio approximately three nights a month,
1 with safety-danger signals being utilized. In addition, HUMANOID
meets once or so a month with HUGGER, either at her home or at the
studio. HUMANKIND contacts remain the same. My contacts with HUMANOID
have taken place at his home, in a mark, in a local pensión, at my
home, and in coffee bars on a staggered schedule of about once a week.
9. With reference to WASH 14671, please be advised that
absolutely no commitments have been made to subject, and, on the
contrary, hints have been dropped to him of a possible curtailment
of funds which might require discontinuing certain operations here.
No difficulty is anticipated in terminating subject upon receipt of
final instructions from headquarters.
10. With further reference to WASH 14671, your attention
is respectfully invited to the following headquarters files which
reflect opinions and evaluations of subject by other staff personnel:
TZPA-365 Part II "Subject's superiors regard this man as
highly dependable."
TZPA-365 Part I "Subject's immediate superior is Lt. Col.

Paul P. Paxton
HUMANOID; Career Status
2 November 1951
1. I do not feel that this man's position in the political
and social life in Costa Rica lends itself to our need for a
career agent in that area. His financial position negates his
accessibility to high-level information, and our requirements
for Costa Rica should not be satisfied through outright subsidi-
zation of an agent in order to place him in a position of influ-
ence. His wife's knowledge of his work for us is lamentable and
her Costa Rican background with substantial local political ties
should be sufficient reason to belay any further consideration on
our part for increasing his knowledge of our operations. Admit-
tedly, he has performed a satisfactory service for the San Jose
station, but his efforts are not so vital that his termination, in
the event he decides to sever connections with us because of his
failure to achieve more prominent status, would be a permanent blow
to our effectiveness there. With respect to his knowledge of
future possibilities with us, we cannot be held responsible for
unauthorized commitments that may have been made by the previous
Chief of Station.
2. The current status of HUMANOID should be established in
line with TRS - 685.

1. Serious consideration has been given to the
suitability of Humanoid for career agent status, and in this connec-
tion, it is to be noted subject is partially aware of the possibilities
of career agent status by virtue of a discussion with the former
Chief of Station. ?
2. It appears that Humanoid fills the requirements set
out in reference memorandum, as follows:
a.
Humancid.
b. His existing cover is well established and believed to be
durable. He has been attending the local university for
over two years; he built and owns his own home in Costa Rica;
he is married to a Costa Rican and has two children born here;
and he has a going business in the form of a photographic
shop which provides an excuse for additional income.
C.
d.
SOI objectives assigned to Humanoid include supervised
direction of Communist Party penetration (Humanist-2); super-
vised direction of Postal Intercept Project (Humankind);
direct provision of information emanating from local university
and intellectual circles of which subject is a member. Also,
subject formerly directed attempted penetration of the Commu-
nist Party women's "front" group (Hugger).
It has been noted that subject's efficiency and productivity
have been hampered by financial considerations in the past.
He has had unusually heavy medical bills, and the rising cost
of living in Costa Rica has presented economic problems in
view of his modest income. It is felt that subject has
valuable potential for expanding his operations under the status
of career agent. With the removal or partial removal of
economic pressure, subject would be able to devote additional
time to the exploitation of numerous personal contacts in
labor, government, religious, and political circles. He is

unusually adept at investigative technique, has the ability
to balance risks involved against value of information-to-
-be-obtained, and is thoroughly familiar with the geography-
and political trends in Costa Rica. To date, subject has
confined his activities mostly to cutout and direction;
however, it is believed that with additional freedom he could
successfully engage in spotting, recruitment, general inves-
tigation, and independent reporting.
Subject has discussed his desire to send his wife and two
children to his family in the United States late in October
for a 60-day visit. He would then like to travel to the
United States himself in late December for a brief visit
with his parents in Illinois. This would be his first visit
home in several years and would provide an excellent oppor-
tunity and cover for headquarters contact, either in Illinois
or Washington, at which time formalities and necessary
training could be accomplished. (NOTE: This planned trip
of subject may temporarily interrupt contact with Humanist-2
and Humankind, as a suitable interim cutout has not yet been
developed; but experience has shown that production from
both sources practically dies out over the Christmas and New
Year holidays in this country.
3. In connection with Paragraph e. above, it is to be
noted that the travel plans of subject's wife have been complicated
by advice from the Embassy Consular Section that the Immigration
authorities at the port of entry into the United States may cemand a
$500.00 U.S. bond in substantiation of her intent to return to Costa
Rica after the 60 days. This station is therefore considering
advancing subject U.S. $500.00 in order to enable him to present the
bond if it is demanded and to obviate the possibility of his spending
several hundred dollars in travel money for his wife to a port of
entry and return to Costa Rica if entry were denied.
This money
would not be used by subject for any other purpose and would be re-
turned to station funds after successful entry of his wife into the
United States.
4. In view of the fact that this Station has no basis
for comparison with regard to possible salary figures which might be
offered subject if career agent status is approved, no recommendation
in this regard is being made. However, it is pointed out that subject
has worked for the organization for almost four years, that his
efficiency has been excellent, his grasp of intelligence requirements
above average, his potential attractive, and that his present position
in the operational structure of this Station is of major importance.
5. It is requested that this Station be advised if you
are interested in considering subject for career agent status.
If so, please advise whether contact will be had with subject while

he is in the United States. Also, will the government reimburse

relatively short time remaining before his trip, it is requested that
I be advised as soon as possible-of-pertinent details, such as
length of time recuired for training, etc., in order tht Humanoid

MEMORANDUM FOR MR. THARP:
SUBJECT: a. HUMANOID
b. Technical Surveillance in Costa Rica
HUMANOID is an American agent used as a cut-out in several
San Jose operations. He was employed in the technical surveillance on
the home of Juan Bosch, as one of the two monitors. He also handles
the photography incident to the HUMANKIND project, which work he
performs in his own quarters. (This may now be performed away from
his home, but until very recently it was done at home.)
HUMANOID's PHS shows the following points which Dave Wright
may be able to clarify:
:
(see TZP-A-365, Part I)
1. His wife is related, through her mother, to the family of
CALDERON. This might be a connection with the "Calederonistas" who
are alleged to be the group of Costa Ricans responsible for mysterious
bombings early this year.
2. Subject's mother-in-law, who resides with him, is described
as follows: "strongly inclined to Sr. Calderon GUARDIA and Leo CORTES
during their respective regimes in Costa Rica, and she is now (Oct 1948)
enthusiastic about the Junta Government of Jose FIGUERES. However,
she takes no active part in politics."
3. Other friends and associates of his wife are: Sr. and Sra.
Miguel Corrales (San Juan Tibas Costa Rica). Miguel Corrales was a
radio operator and intelligence operative for Jose FIGUERES during the
Costa Rican Civil War in the spring of 1948.
Jose FIGUERES and Juan BOSCH were the target personalities
of the technical surveillance. FIGUERES made the statement that "one of
his boys told him all about the surveillance."
From the above circumstances, it appears possible that HUMANOID's
intelligence activities are probably known to either his wife, his mother-in-
law, or his friend, CORRALES, and that one of the three could have been
the source through which the surveillance was blown. Would you discuss
this informally with Dave Wright, please ?

1. In connection with a re-examination of the security
factors of this Project, a pre-arranged visit to the home of
Humanoid was made by the writer.
has constructed a secret dark room under the floor of his house.
As previously reported, subject
and processes the production from the Humankind Project in this
work room. It is therefore necessary that certain compromising
material is retained overnight by Humanoid, and, at present, this
material is kept in a wooden desk with a cheap lock. Although
Humanoid's personal security appears good at this time, the possi-
bility of an unexpected house search or a pure case of house-
breaking with theft as a motive cannot be overlooked, with resultant
serious security considerations.
2. It is therefore requested that headquarters
consider furnishing a small wall safe with a combination lock for
installation in the above-mentioned dark room. It would be possible
to sink the safe into the concrete wall, and even if complete con-
cealment were not possible, the safety of the material would be
greatly enhanced. Suitable safes are not available locally, but
it is known that Remington Rand markets a small strong box with a
combination lock (price about $20.00) which would be ideal.
3. I would appreciate receiving your opinion in this
matter inasmuch as other measures must be taken in the event a safe
cannot be made available.
'
.4. Inasmuch as Humanoid is aware of the proposed salary
raise recommended by the former Chief of Station in the Quarterly
Report dated August 17, 1951, information as to the status of this
recommendation is requested.

former President Rafael Angel CALDERON Guardia. Humanoid advised
that his mother-in-law was friendly with the CALDERON family years

Party since the revolution. "This woman immigrated to Costa Rica
as Dora INIKEN from Europe, and as it is customary for immigrants

President, Dora INIKEN changed her name to CALDERON. Humanoid stated
that she has no political connections whatsoever and is sympathetic
to whatever administration is in power at the time. The information
in the referenced memorandum was originally written by Humanoid
three years ago and has no application to the present.
2. Regarding Humanoid's associates, Sr. and Sra.
Miguel CORRALES, Humanoid stated that he has not seen CORRALES for
over a year since CORRALES is in Guanacaste Province. It is true
that CORRALES was a Figuerista during the revolution, but he is no
longer sympathetic with FIGUERES.

PERIOD: 31 March-1 July 1951.
No change.
Subject was raised from 750 colones per month to
1,000 colones per month, effective 1 March 1951.
Services of this agent continue to be extremely
valuable as the principal cutout for three
subagents. Subject also processes the
information received, adding to it his own
comments drawn from long personal acquaintance
with local conditions. Subject maintains a
good working relationship with subagents
necessary for their continued trusted and
unworried cooperation.
The information procured by subject is valuable
though very little is his own, but rather that
of his subagents.
Reference is made to TRSA950 and TRSW-655
wherein subject's operations, as planned by this
station and approved by headquarters, were set
out. These operations have continued as
outlined without incident or danger to the
security of this agent or this station.
Subject is devoting increasingly more time to
the coverage of mail intercepts, their photo-
stating, and enlarging coverage of same. The
intelligence consciousness as well as the trust
he has built up in Humanist-2 in reporting on
top level Communist activities has taken time
and has produced good results in effective
coverage. In view of his importance to this
station, his ability and his willingness to
devote time to the work when needed, it is
recommended that subject be considered for a
raise in pay from 1,000-colones to 1,500.
Subject is living frugally on his present salary
and his G.I. subsistance. His wife has recently

1. Inquiry made of Humanist regarding the statements
he made before the police during his interrogation reflects that
he reportedly refused to testify before the police but made his
deposition before the Procurador as to his part in the technical
1 installation which implicated only the writer, and this only after
he was told that Roddy had been identified. Humanist's testimony, as
well as the line of questioning to which he was submitted, revealed
the authorities' concern and their efforts to ascertain whether he
had been engaged in or knew of any other similar installations on
any other people. This he denied and maintained that the only
installation was on Juan BOSCH. Humanist claims he made no mention
of Humanoid, and he believes the police know nothing about him.
•
2. Humanist's claims also tally with the account of
his confession as given writer by Manuel VENTURA, Presidential aide.
Humanoid has been on the alert and has noted nothing of a suspicious
nature which would indicate his activities being under observation
or investigation. This matter of suspending his operations, as
suggested by headquarters, was discussed by writer with Elmo R.
Langtry during his recent visit in San José and the following
suggestions are made for headquarters' consideration:
FORM KQ.
a. Humanoid at the present time is acting as cutout and
chief agent for Humanist-2, Humankind-1, and Humankind-3. There
is no other agent at the present time to whom these contacts can
be given. It is believed that if these subagents are allowed a
6-months vacation, they will become practically worthless when
picked up again and have to work for the money they have been
receiving, aside from losing interim information and developments.
b. In an effort to establish a more secure, as well as a
commercial, cover for Humanoid, this office has acceded to
Humanoid's desire to set up a photography and photocopy shop in
the downtown area, and has encouraged him in it by allowing funds
paid for rental of a safehouse to be applied instead as rental
for his photo shop. This provides Humanoid with a good cover in

HUMANOID Project
SCUACI
21 May 1951
1. In accordance with conversations held between Chief, STC and
FDT and with Mr. Johnston of your office, the following modifications
and additional data concerning this project are set forth."
2. On 8 March 1951 a technical surveillance was installed on the
residence of Juan BOSCH, a Caribbean revolutionary leader, utilizing the
services of a telephone company employee, Marcos Aurelius Salazar,
through HUMANIST. HUMANOID and HUMANIST carried on the monitoring in
shifts, but at separated intervals. Shortly thereafter, it was noticed
that some natives living nearby were unduly interested in the activities
of the monitorin; house, and, at the same tine, mysterious bomb explosions
were occurring in San Jose. HUMANIST learned that the police had received
- a report that unknown persons were spying on the airfield, which adjoined
the monitoring post, and perhaps were manufacturing the bombs. The sur-
veillance was discontinued and the equipment moved on 20 March.
3. It was deemed necessary to brief Salazar on a possible investi-
gation and provide him with a suitable cover story. It is believed that
Salazar became frightened, want to the police, and implicated HUMANIST,
1 who was subsequently arrested. After three days, HUMANIST confessed and
implicated the chief of station.
4. The chief of station, through his strong personal connections.
with the Vice President and other high officials, was able to convince
the President this activity was not detrimental to the interests of
Costa Rica and the whole affair was quashed. HUMANIST was released from
jail and the chief of station continues to enjoy cordial and axicable
relations with the Costa Rican officials concerned.
5. It is planned that the chief of station will be transferred in
the near future, at which time HUMANIST will be terminated on the pretext
that all operations are being discontinued. The only other current
operation which HUMANIST knows anything about is HUMANIST-2, whom he was
instrumental in recruiting in July 1949. He has had nothing to do with
HUMANIST-2 since then and has never known who handles him or even if he
is in contact with our station at the present time. It is believed that
HUMANOID's true identity is unknown to him, and so far as he knows,
HUMANOID was only helping on the one job, the technical surveillance.

a business which he is enthusiastic about and is a more natural
place for Humanist-2 to make unobserved contacts. It also
supplies Humanoid with a more accessible spot and efficient means
to photostat mail intercepts and return them to the post office
in time instead of commuting back and forth from his home in
the suburbs of San José.
. C. Therefore, it is suggested that Humanoid's semi-weekly
contacts with Humanist-2, instead of being cancelled, be changed
to a weekly letterdrop, and a live contact once a month to take
care of salary payments and briefing. This letterdrop can be
effected by Humanist-2 passing by the photo shop at night and
dropping his messages through the slot in the door usually used
for after-hours delivery of films to be developed. The film
drop will be into a padlocked box, accessible only to Humanoid.
d. Regarding Humanoid's contacts with Humankind-1 and
Humankind-3, these are conducted in a thoroughly safe manner.
Mail extracted from postal channels by them is deposited in an
envelope and placed in a post office box. It is checked daily
by Humanoid, and if anything is there, it is removed, photostated,
and returned by him the same day. If anyone is noticed hanging
around the post office boxes, Humanoid does not go near the box
and returns later when the way is clear.
e. Another factor has arisen since the last dispatch which
has made this post office operation more secure in that the
Director of the Post Office is now beholden to Humanoid. In a
recent legal squabble noted in the press which was raised by a
local Communist complaining about the government confiscating
his mail from abroad, the government desired to prove that this
mail was Communist propaganda which they had a right to confiscate,
and the President therefore requested the Director of the Post
Office to furnish samples to prove this point. With this "heat"
on him, the Director made a frantic appeal to Humanoid, who was
able to procure these samples for him, which satisfied the
President, and for which the Director was truly grateful.
Therefore, no trouble is expected from this intercept operation
as long as the present personnel are being used, and ample warning
will be given Humanoid in advance of any change in the present
attitude.
3. Since it is believed that there is more to be lost
than gained by dropping contact with these agents, the above modifi-
cations of these contacts are respectfully submitted for headquarters'
consideration and decision.

Project Outline-FJVANOID
19 February 1951
1. To complete the attached field project outline, the following
biographical information is subcritted as required by paragraph 4:
HUMANOID was born in 1922 in Dekalb, Illinois, USA, where
he attended high school from which he graduated in 1940.
Subject joined the United States Air Force in which he had
five years' experience in general Air Force intelligence
work. Subject is presently living in San Jose, Costa Rica,
where he has been attending school.
2. This project dates from June 1943 in Costa Rica but subject was
e agent of our Panama station for about six months prior to his departure
for Costa Rica.
3. Subject's reliability is considered excellent and his operational
services are also considered excellent. The value of this project,
including the sub-agents, is considered to be of great value to our
Costa Rican mission.
4. HUMANOID, in addition to being a principal agent, is employed
as a cut-out for HUMANIST-2, HUGGER, and HRANKIND. Attached are field
project outlines for HUMANIST-2 and MANKIND, which includes HEANKIND-1
and -3. Technically, HUMANIST-2,' HULLANILD-1 and -3 are sub-agents and
therefore not required to have field project outlines submitted. The
original development, however, of these agents was on an individual
project basis, and the cut-out HRANOID was later developed.
5. In lieu of a field project outline for HUGGER, the following
is submitteds
HUGGER is a Costa Rican by birth. She is private secretary
in the main office of the United Fruit Company in San Jose,
and is a secret agent of Guardia Civil of Costa Rica.
HUGOSA has the objective and task of developing contacts
anong Vanguardia Popular members, particularly in the women's
front..
While HUGGER's production is not great, it is valuable. Her
pay is approximately $11.00 a month.

1. Certain rearrangements involving three current

effectiveness and security. The projects involved are Humanoid,
Humanist and Humankind.
2. The owner of the separate office used by Humanoid
to process the material received through Project Humankind has
requested that the space be vacated by 15 September 1949.
His
reasons are purely business and have nothing to do with our
operations. On that date, therefore, our effects will be moved
to a new locale, which is incidentally more desirable from the.
point of view of convenience and security. The new "safe-house9”
will cost $400.00 per month, an increase of $275.00 over that
paid for the former office, and is to be charged to Project
Humankind effective 15 September 1949.

3. To offset this increased cost but principally to
provide adequate exploitation of Humanist-2, that individual
will be turned over to Humanoid for direct handling prior to
1 October 1949. Humanist-1, whose sole function has been to
contact Humanist-2 and who has received a salary of $250.00 per
month, will be eliminated on 1 October 1949. This arrangement
has been carefully planned and discussed with all concerned and
can be made without security risk. It will provide intelligent,

Project HUMANOID is the most important single project of the San Jose
Station, and the basis for all existing and contemplated OSO activities
in the area. It is requested that the restrictions imposed upon project
HUMANOID, as contained in TRS-W-655, copy attached, be lifted at this time,
and the Chief of Station be authorized to direct the activities of NUKANOID
into the following channels.
(a) Direct and close supervision of HUMANOID-3, the Station's.
penetration of the Vanguardia Popular, Costa Rican Communist Party,
in order to utilise fully the agente potentialities. HUMANOID-3
is intelligent, has a vide knowledge of Communist activities, pleas
and personalities and is desirous of cooperating to the extent of his
ability. After a thorough de-briefing of HUMANOID-3 by HUMANOID,
in order to ac uaint him, HUMANOID-3 with the Station's specific.
interests and requirements, plus the subsequent close supervision which
will be exercised by HUMANOID, and the continuing close supervision of
HUNANOID-3 by HUMANOID, it is felt that the station will then be in
a position to provide intensive and adequate coverage of the objectives
assigned to it in the San Jose SOI.
(b). Direct and close supervision of HUMANOID-4, the Station's
penstration of the Women's Fronts affiliated with the Vanguardia
Popular. It is felt that the former cut-out HUCKLEBONE, who handled
HUMANOID until 1 June 1949, was somewhat inept in his operational
dealings, which possibly may account for what seems to be a lack of
productivity in the HUMANOID-4 project. HUKAHCID-4 has an intimate
relationship with active CP members in Costa Rica, both on a low and
high level, and possesses a definite potential for both independent
reporting, and for spotting a likely individual to be used as a
parallel to the HUMANOID-3 project. HUMANOID, who will now handle
HUNAHOID-4, is capable of directing this agents efforts into the
proper channels, and capitalizing fully on the talents possessed by
the individual. It is felt that this is another instance whereby
HUMAHOID, by working closely and directly with the individual can make
a substantial contribution to the efforts of the San Jose Station.
(c) Direct and close supervision of HUMANOID-1 and HUMANOID-2,
the mail intercept operations presently covering the General Post
Office in San Jose. The information that HUMANOID-1 has access to

with a formal request for project authorization until he
has established himself in this area and we have made his
acquaintance. Tentatively it is planned to use him in a

to play an integrated part in our operational set-up, and

9 June 1947). It is a simple recruitment of an individual agent to be
controlled exclusively by the San José Station. TZF-Å-365 Part II sug-
gested a manner in which he night establish contact with HYDROCYST I.
Since HYDROCYST I is leaving Costa Rica terporarily, this is no longer
a consideration.
2. All documents in our files have been forwarded to San José. This station
has only contacted Subject twice and has told him nothing about our organi-
zation or any possibilities of any full time positions. If we can assist
by arranging a contact between HYDROPATHIC and San José or in any other
manner, we will be glad to do so. In the meantime, we will take no further
action unless instructed to do so by the Home Office.

a very satisfactory type of agent. He displays a certain amount
of initiative in voluntarily performing tasks not specifically
requested by the Chief of Station through the cut-out HUMANOID.
HUMANOID-2 has demonstrated the qualities of villingness, discretion,.
and cooperation.
(d) As to the principal agent of Project HUMANOID, the
following observations are submitted, which will indicate
unmistakeably the value of this project, and its contribution
to the successful activities of the San Jose Station.
Evaluation of services - As the principal agent
and station cut-out, HUMANOID is charged with the direction
and guidance of HUMANOID-1; HUMANOID-2; 'HUMANOID-3;
HUMAHOIDA. His handling of these agents is carried out in
a professional and efficient manner, and his personal comments
and corrections on their reports, based on his long acquaintance
with local personalities and conditions, are of consideráble
value. His attitude remains enthusiastic and willing.
Evaluation of information - The information produced
by the agents being handled by HUMANOID is of great value
to the station. In addition to his own production, this
agents operations are well suited to checking on information
received from other sources.
COMMENTS - Despite the fact that HUMANOID has been working under
certain operational restrictions for a number of months, his value to the
station continues to be of major importance. In addition to the tangible
and measureable information produced by and through him, EUMANOID has
proved to be the single most valuable source of background and orientation
data for the Chief of Station. His knowledge of the history of Costa
Rican comamist activities and personalities, and his grasp of the various
revolutionary movements and figures has been freely shared with the
Chief of Station. These "briefing meetings" represent an intangible
contribution to the over-all performance of the Station. HUMANOID is
eager to expand his operations and upon the removal of present operational
restrictions it is believed that he can be given further responsibilities,
particularly in the recruiting of additional sub-agents. The station is
presently interested in accomplishing a parallel penetration of the
Commist Party of Costa Rica, in expanding routine investigative coverage
and in developing additional sources on political movements. It is
believed that HUMANOID can insure the success of these new ventures.
