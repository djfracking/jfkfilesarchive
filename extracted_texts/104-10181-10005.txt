works on cultural matters, and is responsible for publication
of the Embassy bulletin, RUIZ mentioned that he is
interested in offering Cuban documentaries to Spanish Cine
(Movie) Clubs as they now have a large number, "an infinity",
of documentaries showing both Cuban technical application
and how the people live. RUIZ also asked to see copies of
the Embassy bulletin and in the meantime suggested MARTINEZ
do a bulletin drawing a parallel between Gibralter and
Guantanamo. Finally, according to a QUDOZE report of

The
literature but also includes public information media.
Embassy has already built up a series of press contacts
the past years and the Cuban Revolution seems to draw
a ready response in Spanish intellectual circles as
evidenced by the Spanish delegates attending the Cultural
Congress held in Havana from 4-11 January 1968. An expense-
paid trip is always attractive to be sure but the delegates,
many of whom were not communists, were also, sympathetic to
the host. Accordingly, within the limits imposed by the
Spanish government, Station Madrid expects an increase in
the propaganda and political action activities of the Cuban
official establishment.

1. The new Cuban Ambassador to Spain, Orestes
Guillermo RUIZ Perez arrived in Madrid on the Iberia flight
of 3 December 1967 accompanied by his wife, Nilda, and three
sons. CALZADILLA, RUIZ's predecessor had not been a strong
administrator and had let the various components of the
Cuban official establishment in Spain run their own affairs.
This fact plus the inevitable tendency of a new chief to be
a "new broom" and rearrange things according to his own
lights, led Station Madrid to expect some changes particularly
within the Embassy. However, the QUDOZE and QUȚIMID operations
have shown RUIZ at least initially to be an aggressive and
well organized individual with ideas of his own that clearly
reflect his background in commercial affairs and prepared to
make changes that promise to go beyond the superficial
sweeping of a new broom. Underlying RUIZ's actions and
proposals is the clear implication that he came to Madrid
with the specific task of upgrading the Cuban mission in
Spain both in terms of prestige and effectiveness. Station
Madrid will transmit to the addressees the relevant
information on this program as it becomes available from the
QUDOZE and QUTIMID operations along with information on the
official Cuban personalities administering the program.
2. A striking difference between RUIZ and his
predecessor was noted in the QUDOZE and QUTIMID reports of
that first week. RUIZ has no inhibitions over spending
money. One of the Embassy cars, a Peugeot was replaced with
a new model and there was discussion of replacing the other
two Peugeots with new ones. Nilda, RUIZ's wife, was picked
up by the wife of GOVIN who turned $200 over to her to go
shopping at the Corte Inglesa, one of Madrid's two best

with the Cuban consuls following his arrival in Spain, the
Pesult was a long meeting at which primary attention was
given to administrative matters, trade and propaganda. The
subject of propaganda will be dealt with in this dispatch.

2. The Castro regime has always attached great
importance to propaganda activities of all kinds and when the
new Cuban Charge d'Affaires began to re-organize the work of
his subordinates, propaganda matters were not overlooked.
According to the QUDOZE and QUTIMID operations, the
provincial consulates have been receiving four types of
propaganda for distribution, two of which were identified.
One was the propaganda put out by the organizations created
by the Castro regime, for example "The Voice of Vietnam".
The other is newspapers. PACHECO, Consul in Sevilla,
mentioned Granma, which he claimed many people read, and
added that lately he had been receiving Juventude Rebelde.
3. RUIZ's ideas apparently go beyond hand-shaking and
the distribution of propaganda. He asked the consuls to
make a list of all the institutes and all the scientific
centers in their territories including the special positions
of these centers and any other relevant information. They
are to use these lists to develop a systematic work plan
of visiting each one, making friends, trying to obtain
scholarships for Cuba, trying to obtain publications and
propaganda of every type, free if possible or by subscription

Rent another building where the Chancillary,

Rent or preferably buy a residence for the Chief

adequate;
Send another person from Cuba who has the
background to take care of scientific work plus
continuing the contacts the Mission will have
already made. In view of RUIZ's previous
statement on the completeness of the staff,
a person would likely be a "non-official"

such as the Casa de las Americas.

deputy, on the proper clothes for diplomatic functions in
Madrid and an appointment was to be made with a tailor.
Nilda declared that the apartment where CALZADILLA and his
family had lived economically was inadequate and they
decided to look for a chalet, something very spacious and
well-priced, They subsequently seriously considered one

side, RUIZ listened sympathetically to complaints about low
salaries, old buildings and inadequate operating budgets and
concluded by asking for a monthly report on receipts and
expenses and a report on the consuls' curient needs, their
monthly balances and their administrative activities. The
printing and telephone bills were the two items of expense
that kept recurring throughout the discussions.
4. By the end of the week, RUIZ had prepared a report
on the situation he found in the Chancerry and the mission
in general for forwarding to Havana and which he first
discussed with his subordinates. He started by assuring
them that he had "found great co-operation among all the
comrades in this mission" and declared that the staff was
complete. Apparently, RUIZ intends to make no personnel
changes and Hector GALLO Portieles, who had previously been
most eager to return PCS to Havana, now has gone to Havana
on vacation. He left Madrid on the 20 December 1967 Iberia
flight.
5. The Cuban mission has certain financial problems
since the present budget dates from previous years and does
not cover current expenses. However, the "new economic
activities of the consulate" are expected to assist with the
problem. Here RUIZ is presumably referring to the pressure
brought to bear in November 1967 by Cuban sympathizers in
the Spanish Foreign Office working through the Customs and
the Immigration Office to force Cuban exiles to register
with the Cuban consulate and pay the $22.50 fee for a valid
passport. Enough exiles have responded to this pressure to .
relieve some of the financial problems of the Cuban mission.
This source of income will last as long as the Cubans' friends
in the Foreign Ministry are able to assist them.
6. The reception of Cuban official travelers at the
airport and the handling of Embassy pouches poses a
Jose
continuing administrative problem for the Embassy.
✓ DIAZ Puga, who is in charge of this airport work has to
devote himself exclusively to taking care of the couriers
and their pouches when any come in, leaving visitors to fend

JMWAVE traces reveal that (fnu) RUIZ, successor
to Francisco CALZADILLA Nunez, 201-315988, may be identical with
Orestes Guillermo RUIZ Perez, 201-735296. Information pertaining
to RUIZ Perez is as follows:
a. In August 1963, RUIZ was appointed Cuban Commercial
Counsellor at Mexico City, and was believed to be a G-2 official
attempting to infiltrate counterrevolutionary groups based in
Mexico. (UFGA-11065, dated 16 September 1963, and UFGA-11445,
dated 23 September 1963.)
-
b. In 1964 an attempt was made to establish com-
munications with RUIZ through Antonio VECIANA, an uncle of RUIZ'
wife. VECIANA stated that neither he nor members of his family
were in correspondence with RUIZ, and that he was unwilling to act
as a "go-between. (UFGA-19006, dated 21 December 1964.)
-
C. A Headquarters' "WATCHLIST" card, dated 1 June 1965,
indicates that RUIZ was believed to be assigned to the General
Directorate of Intelligence, Ministry of Interior, in Havana.
2. AMOT traces pertaining to Orestes Guillermo RUIZ Perez,
and an evaluation of his new assignment are attached.

he would cooperate. They stated that RUIZ's father was an
old guard communist and his brother (first name not given)
was a member of the Department of State Security (DSE, the
In May 1964,

1. The earliest information in the file of Guillermo RUIZ
Perez, born 1931, is that he was in exile in Mexico during the
BATISTA rogime. In April 1962, he was described by a refugee
who was a former co-worker as a militiaman and a militant communist
who was Chief of the Department of Construction Expenses Studies,
Office of Financial Statistics, Ministry of Treasury. RUIZ
arrived in Mexico City in August 1963 as Commercial Counsellor.
Shortly thereafter, AMTIKI/1, a reliable JUWAVE asset, stated
he had received a letter from a friend inCuba who stated that
RUIZ was a "G-2" member sent to Mexico to infiltrate counter-
revolutionary groups. In January 1964, LITAMIL/9, a reliable
Mexico Station asset, reported that RUIZ of the commercial office
was emerging as a fanatical Fidelista.
L
2. In April 1964, the AMOTS contacted several members of
the VECIANA family (relatives of Nilda VECIANA Lopez, wife of
Guillermo RUIZ) who live in Miami to see if any one of them
would be willing to contact RUIZ for purposes of recruitment.

1. On 16 January 1969 QUT INID reported a discussion
between Subiect and the Chief of the Rumanian Trade. delegation
in Spain, during which the Rumanian asked when they could meet.
Subject invited the Rumanian to his home where, he said, he
has set up a small office and was beginning to work more at
home than in the office, because of the added comfort. (We
wouldn't be surprised if this was suggested by his wife who
is very jealous of her husband.) The meeting was arranged
for 1130 hours on 17 January. AMAUTO-1 commented that he is
up quite early in the morning, presumably to begin work in
his office.
2. The above report is the first we have received on
Subject's use of his home as an office. The invitation to
the Rumanian, of course, casts suspicion on the nature of the
conversation.
-
3. Since his move to new quarters, AMAUTO-1's home is
about 50 yards from two WOFIRM staffers Martin B. CRYMM and
Conrad B. FALAGIARO. (See attached sketch). Edwin B. RATTEREE
lives approximately 200 yards from the AMAUTO home. This
proximity to AMAUTO-1's home by three staffers brings up the
question of the use of an RF device to monitor conversations.
in AMAUTO's office at home, assuming at this time, that he
has a phone in the office, most likely an extension of the
home phone. For planning purposes, we would appreciate from
MKNOVA a list of requirements for a target study in the use
of an RF device. If other means are available for external
penetration of his home we would welcome your suggestions
and comments. Please advise us also if the PF device is still
a controlled item, which cannot be discussed with or released
to liaison. Your earliest reply would be appreciated.

QUDOZE
1. The following conversation came from Subject source:
(At a meeting with Hector GALLO and Aristides DIAZ,
the following statement was made by Guillermo E
RUIZ
Cuban Charge d'affaires:
2.
i-
.
"You know why I'm saying this.. because the CIA is
directly intervening in the internal affairs of the
country, ARAGON can say it, the DGS Director can say
it, as well as our dear friend Don Camilo PONSEVEDRA
(phon.), and here they don't permit this or anything
because they know very well that...... here the Soviet
KGB as well as the American CIA can't.....because the
Spaniards....hate it so much. The Americans are trying
to asphyxiate this government, first because while
FRANCO is in power there is always the great danger of
a revolt here. The Americans want to have a government
in Spain of the type Italy, France and West Germany have,
a stable government, that has a high middle class and
where there is a high standard of living, because when
you have the difference between the individual who is
eating.....and the individual who is eating a chicken,
then you have a dangerous problem, because in Latin
America we have. but here in Europe it's different,
that is why I'm telling you this..... they can be inter-
vening in the government.....that is why we must try to
find out."
'
->
Following is the identity of the personnel involved
Hector GALLO Protieles, First Secretary of Cuban Embassy, also
believed to be Chief, DSE officer stationed at the Embassy.
a.

comrade who learns the details of foreign commerce in order to be
able to converse wall with people. Apparently this would be a
type of overt specialty that they would give to the comrade who
in order to hide the true purpose of his mission which would be to
collect information for them as AMAUTO-1 is heard to comment that
they have to "invent" the work of this comrade in order that he
might have a definite specialty. AMAUTO-1 seems to be thinking of
a specific person because he comments that he speaks two languages,
that he likes economics, and adds that at the end of two months he
would be ready.
3. Following the return of AMA DRIFT-1 on the 7th of March 68,
via PBRUMEN national flight, after home leave in PBRUMEN, the QUDOZE
natorial reported extensive conversations between AMA DRIFT-1 and
AMAUTO-1 on future plans. Two were of MHGUILE interest:

B.
-
QUDOZE Rport of 13 March 68. AMAUTO-1 says, "this is...
with the American movement in Spain and with the monopoly
that they have here" He says, "In my judgement our
fundamental problem in Spain from the political point of
view is to ascertain what there is behind all this, what is
there here, we must get ourselves in motion". "That is a
very important point for us, to ascertain what are their
names, who are those who are here, how they (the Americans)
are moving". He adds that, "If we are able to find out, we
will be able to stop them completely."
.
-
QUDOZE Report of 14 Mar 68. AMAUTO-1 says that they have
to find out "what are the forces in Spain, with the pos-
sibility of our having access (to them)". He comments that
Spain, is at a crossroads internally and externally. He
says they have to find out what is happening in Spain,
whether they give the workers liberty to strike, etc.
He again repeats all they have to find out, mentions find-
ing out "who are the monarchists, what forces they repre-
sent, to what forces are they united, who are the elements
that are being financed by the CIA and by the American
Embassy". "Which are those scattered elements that the
newspaper of the Movement has accused of being backed by
the American Embassy, what financial power do they have?"
4. AMAUTO-1 had apparently set great hope on the 1 May 68
anti-government demonstration by workers and students which, as
Headquarters is aware, the police effectively handled. In a 2
May QUDOZE Report, AMAUTO-1 repeatedly commented on what a tremen-
dous failure the demonstration had been; he kept asking AMA DRIFT-1
what had happened, why the Spanish people had not responded, why
the workers had not, and finally said "The next demonstration we
are going to name here a member of the Embassy".

Indications of Clandestine Activi-
ty planned by PBRUMEN Embassy in
Madrid.
In the four month period since the forwarding of ref B
the QUDOZE and QUTIMID Operations have continued to provide insights
into the program of the PBRUMEN official establishment in Spain, the
requirements laid on it and the evolution in the thinking of
AMAUTO-1 and his staff as they work toward expanding their contacts
and influence in the political, economic and cultural-propaganda
fields. These developments will provide the subject matter for
subsequent dispatches. However, in addition to such conventional.
"public relations", the QUIOZ Reports have recently carried evi-
dence of MRGUILE activity. Because such activity automatically
means PBHUMEN involvement in Spain's internal affairs, QUOTA has
taken an even greater than usual interest in these developments.
Translations of the transcripts detailing this information are given
below.
8.
The earliest and certainly the most striking MHGUILE in-
formation was forwarded under ref A describing AMAUTO-1's advice
to AMADIEU-1 on the techniques of living a clandestine life, on
the use of disguise and on the necessity for good organization for
"with bad organization we are lost". Then, & QUDOZE Report of
30 April 68 summarized a discussion on the lack of personnel in
the Embassy to make scientific and technical contacts, at which
time AMAUTO-1 digressed into describing the cover for a new member
of the staff whom he apparently expected to arrive in the near.
future.
what is lacking is a comrade who could take care
of the cultural and apparently the technical aspect also. Who
could also ascertain who are the Americans, their addresses, in
what streets are located their...." He adds that this comrade will
have to move about, to make contacts, to be up on everything, and
if time remains to do other things. He added that he remembers the
President (of PBRUMEN) gave much importance to this as a matter of
honor for all the missions abroad. He repeated that the technical
aspect (i.e.collecting technical information) required a comrade, a

1. Osvaldo GARCIA who arrived in Spain nearly two
months ago to supervise the production of two-burner stoves
being manufactured by the Spanish firm Tallers Cataluna, S. A.
(TACA) (TACA is also manufacturing the 10,000 cane wagons for
the Cubans), passed through Madrid on 23 September and told
AMAUTO-1 that there was an unidentified Cuban in Zaragoza
who is preparing a study on Spanish firms trading with Cuba.
AMAUTO-1 immediately suspected that this Cuban was an agent
of RVROCK and suggested that GARCIA get to know this person

to get a photograph of him for possible identification.

Rent another building where the Chancillary,
the Commercial Office, the Consulate and the
Cubana Offices can all be housed instead of

Rent or preferably buy a residence for the Chief

adequate;
Send another person from Cuba who has the
background to take care of scientific work plus
continuing the contacts the Mission will have
already made. In view of RUIZ's previous
statement on the completeness of the staff, such
person would likely be a "non-official"
representative of one of Cuba's cultural fronts
such as the Casa de las Americas.

stated they could install a teletype that could only receive,
not send, messages but this seemed acceptable.
.
3. On Monday, 4 December 1967, the day after his arrival,
RUIZ ordered the Cuban consuls in Barcelona, Sevilla and
Vigo to Madrid for a meeting. The order was couched in terms
of "wanting to meet" them, but after their arrival on
Wednesday, 6 December, all parties settled down to a detailed
meeting in which primary attention was given to administrative
matters, trade and propaganda. The latter two subjects will
be dealt with in separate dispatches. On the administrative
side, RUIZ listened sympathetically to complaints about low
salaries, old buildings and inadequate operating budgets and
concluded by asking for a monthly report on receipts and
expenses and a report on the consuls' current needs, their

printing and telephone bills were the two items of expense
that kept recurring throughout the discussions.
4. By the end of the week, RUIZ had prepared a report
on the situation he found in the Chancerry and the mission
in general for forwarding to Havana and which he first
discussed with his subordinates. He started by assuring
them that he had "found great co-operation among all the
comrades in this mission" and declared that the staff was
complete. Apparently, RUIZ intends to make no personnel
changes and Hector GALLO Portieles, who had previously been
most eager to return PCS to Havana, now has gone to Havana
on vacation. He left Madrid on the 20 December 1967 Iberia
flight.

5. The Cuban mission has certain financial problems
since the present budget dates from previous years and does
not cover current expenses. However,
However, the "new economic
activities of the consulate" are expected to assist with the
problem. Here RUIZ is presumably referring to the pressure
brought to bear in November 1967 by Cuban sympathizers in
the Spanish Foreign Office working through the Customs and
the Immigration Office to force Cuban exiles to register
with the Cuban consulate and pay the $22.50 fee for a valid
passport. Enough exiles have responded to this pressure to
relieve some of the financial problems of the Cuban mission.
This source of income will last as long as the Cubans' friends
in the Foreign Ministry are able to assist them.

continuing administrative problem for the Embassy.
DIAZ Puga, who is in charge of this airport work has to
devote himself exclusivaly to taking care of the couriers
and their pouches when any come in, leaving visitors to fend
for themselves. This situation has been alleviated by
other Embassy staff members jaunting out to the airport at
will to meet the incoming planes. Now, RUIZ has declared
that the rest of the staff must stay in the Embassy because
they have a work plan to fulfill. Thus, he has left himself
with an unresolved problem he must face in the very near
future..

1. On 10 January 1968, AMAUTO-1, in one of his many daily
discussions with his subordinates, reflected on the international
position of his country, and among the things he said, we quote
the following which may be of possible interest to addressees.
Although part of the discussion was not heard because of the
emotional inflection of the speaker, we feel that the jist of
the discussion is clear and understandable.
-
"We are demonstrating to the world that Cuba...is
favorably disposed to do whatever... (AMAUTO-1 begins
to talk against the United States) that when the
Americans have to raise the white flag...because the
first plane that appears on radar... (AMAUTO-1 is
speaking excitedly and it is very difficult to understand
each word but it appears that he is talking about the:
positions of missiles in Cuba), Havana, Las Villas and
Camaguey and that with these missiles, we can cover
Miami, New York, and all their bases and all of their
"mierda" ..if the Americans say they are going to
su them (missiles? planes?), we will send them; if
they (Americans) say they are going to invade us, the
first plane that comes to invade... (AMAUTO-1's sub-
ordinate remarked that 15 October 62 marked a point
in international politics, when the Yankees ordered
the Soviets to withdraw their missiles). (AMAUTO-1
injected) "they (the Soviets) presented them (the
Cubans) with ten bombs".
2. Our reason for reporting this fragmentary information is
that AMAUTO-1 might be confirming the presence of offensive nis-
siles in Cuba.

of 3 December 1967 accompanied by his wife, Hilda, and three
song CALZADILLA, RUIZ's predecessor had not been a strong
administrator and had let the various components of the
Cuban official establishment in Spain run their own affairs.
This fact plus the inevitable tendency of a new chief to be
"new broom" and rearrange things according to his own
lights, led Station Indrid to expect some changes particularly
within the Embassy. However, the QUDOZE and QUTIMID operationa
have shown RUIZ at least initially to be an aggressive and
well organized individual with ideas of his own that clearly
reflect his background in commercial affairs and prepared to
make changes that promise to go beyond the superficial
sweeping of a new broom. Underlying RUIZ's actions and
proposals is the clear implication that he came to Madrid
with the specific task of upgrading the Cuban mission in
Spain both in terms of prestige and effectiveness. Station
Madrid will transait to the addressees the relovant
information on this program as it becomes available from the
QULOZE and QUTIMID operations along with information on the
official Cuban personalities administering the program.
3. A striking difference between RUIZ and his
predecessor was noted in the QUIOZE and QUTIMID reports of
that first week. RUIZ has no inhibitions over spending
money. One of the Embassy cars, a Peugeot was replaced with
a new model and there was discussion of replacing the other
two Pougeots with new ones. Nilda, RUIZ's wife, was picked
up by the wife of COVIN sho turned $200 over to her to go

Guillermo RUIZ Perez, Charge d'Affaires of the
Culan Embassy in Madrid, has occupied that post for
nearly a year. During that time, the QUDOZE/QUTIMID
material has revealed various facets of his personality,
showing him to be a man of volatile temper, an incessant
talker and with more breadth of experience and outlook
than the other members of the local Cuban mission.

Here in Spain he has been interested in meeting as many
people as possible and in widening his circle of
acquaintances No matter what their political views
be, he feels it is worth establishing some kind of
relationship with them and will listen attentatively
to persons with a good reputation in the intellectual
world. He has laid great emphasis on cultural matters
in outlining his plans for the Embassy's activities. He
has shown a certain intellectual restlessness, a desire
to keep abreast of events in the world outside of Cuba
and a willingness to accept whatever he deems to be good
or useful from that exterior world. Thus, during his
early conversations with his staff soon after his arrival,
he extolled the virtues of the Yankee system of "briefing"
and the fact that executives have privacy for thinking
without being bothered by the routine details of the
office RUIZ has been concerned over having Cuba and
the Cubans well thought of in Spain. He early said he

reduced to a very narrow circle and since Cuba was
economically it was now necessary to give attention to
"in"
the political and cultural fields.
on the fact that Cuba is practically unknown in Spain,
He later commented
that Cuban products are never seen in the local stores
and that the view of Cuba of the average Spaniard has
come from the exiles. He has continued to discuss the
need for advertising Cuban products and considered
decorating his office and his home with Cuban items and
furniture so he could show a little bit of Cuba to his
Spanish and foreign contacts. Another consequence of
this desire to put Cuba's best foot forward is a certain
harshness in dealing with the shortcomings of his
colleagues and fellow Cubans outside the mission, calling
attention to any deficiencies in their conduct and ways
of dealing with the persons they meet. As recently as
in a QUDOZE report of 13 July he was complaining that the
Cubans seem to have lost the elegant touch in their
public functions.
-
3. RUIZ's attitude toward money follows logically
from his desire that Cuba's prestige increase and he is
quite willing to spend money where it will show.
Embassy's 6 January reception was an expensive affair,
The
the Embassy and Commercial officers take their Spanish
contacts to the best restaurants, he and his wife pay
30,000 pesetas (approximately $ 430.00) rent per month
for a house deemed suitable to his position and buy new
clothes without hesitation for the various diplomatic
functions. Before he went on home leave on 6 August 1968,
he was encouraging his staff to rent better apartments
that would more nearly match their status as diplomats
and his wife was looking for a different house for them,
one with fewer maintenance headaches and with rooms large
enough for small receptions of as many as 40 people.
✓ All of this is quite in accord with RUIZ's own bourgoise
tastes, reflected more than any thing else in his great
Interest in clothes and in being well dressed.
Cuban mission operates on a slim budget and the salaries
Yet the
are not high. Station Madrid has no information on
whether Cuban mission personnel receive a housing
allowance but assumes they must as otherwise RUIZ, at
least, could never make ends meet. RUIZ earns a gross
salary of $681.50 per month and all his living expenses
including clothes, food, medical expenses, education for
the couple's 5 children and perhaps utilities must come
from this sum. RUIZ also expects to be able to invite
Cuban officiils transiting Madrid and his Spanish and
foreign contacts home for lunch or dinner at any time.
There is no indication that he receives a representation
allowance yet he will allow his wife to charge nothing
except the salaries of two maids to the Embassy and she
can't economize on food when they are alone because he
will go out to a restaurant rather than eat rice and beans.
RUIZ is plainly cautious in his dealings with Havana over
mɔney, even while wanting to live as well as possible
in Madrid. The difference in the couple's manner of
living between Havana and Madrid must be striking since
RUIZ had a good position in the Ministry of Foreign Commerce
prior to becoming Charge d'Affaires and yet his wife told
Vera, the Embassy secretary and her closest friend, that
she did not have a refrigerator in Cuba and would like
to take one back with her if they did not return to Madrid
after home leave!

4. As an individual, RUIZ has appeared in
QUDOZE/QUTIMID as nervous, capricious, quick tempered.
In contrast to his pleasant public appearance and his
usually acceptable telephone language, his private
conversation is vulgar, low and full of ugly words.
He swears continually and flies off into rages. He is
a compulsive talker and apparently uses his long.
conversations and his consultations over some course
of action as a means of psychological reinforcement.
He has given the impression of being insecure in his
„position and when faced with an accumulation of
problems in the office prior to home leave, was talking
of resigning and returning to Cuba. This insecurity
may account for his touchiness over the way he is
treated by the Spaniards, especially those in government
positions. He has been noted describing several of his
interviews with Spanish Ministers or people holding
important government positions at great length, going
into much detail on the length of the meeting, if they
shook hands, if the person smiled, if he had anything
nice to say about Cuba or the Cubans, etc. As the
addressees know, RUIZ came to his post as a transfer
from the Ministry of Foreign Commerce. On numerous
occasions he has said that his life interest is in
commerce and industry and prior to his vacation in Cuba,
he was increasingly depressed over his present position
and his ability to fill it, which may account for some
of this sense of personal uncertainty. He has seemed
a hard worker and a man with good ideas on the work of
the Embassy and how it should be organized, ideas which
he has repeated endlessly, but he has been unable to
inspire in his subordinates. In his disputes with GALLO
in June he complained about the lack of team spirit in
the office.
5. RUIZ's political ideas are centered in the Cuban
revolution and the Station considers him as an
unquestioned regime supporter. However, his approach
is different from that of the younger, less. intelligent
men who have known nothing else. RUIZ has had a
sufficient breadth of education and experience to make
a choice, to have reached his own decision that the
Castro regime is good for Cuba and that Marxism as
interpreted by the Cubans is an adequate intellectual
foundation for life. A QUDOZE Report of 13 December 1967
included a discussion with a Spanish employee of the
Embassy during which RUIZ explained that the Cuban
revolution is different from any other revolution there.
has ever been in the world, that it has different
characteristics and trajectories, that in spite of having
a mark of Marxist principles it has many variations
which make it different. These variations are unknown
even to some of the comrades themselves. In a QUDOZĘ
Report of 23 June, he commented on certain features of
the Cuban system as "very difficult to understand unless
one is of the left" The QUDOZE Report of 4 July quoted
extensively in OSMA-24,112 of 9 August 1968 showed
most clearly RUIZ's view of Cuba and the revolution as
one entity and to see himself within that structure,
part of it and serving it. Beyond that, his mind runs
in business and public relations rather than political
channels and he has shown less interest in the policies
than in the power relationships of the men within the
hierarchy who administer the policies. He has been
able to avoid sounding doctrinaire in his discussions and
has been able to deal satisfactorily with the wide variety

subordinates should back him by taking the same positions
in public that he takes, a not unreasonable demand on
the part of a Chief of Mission. RUIZ bluntly told GALLO
that he, GALLO, had committed an error and GALLO just as
bluntly, disagreed. GALLO's view was that RUIZ had come in
in
a bad humor and nothing pleased him whereas RUIZ felt
GALLO-should try putting himself in RUIZ's place, something
he claims GALLO is incapable of doing. Finally, this
particular argument ended in a form of compromise with
GALLO agreeing to call ROMERO the following day and remind
him that he "should call the Minister".
.
3. On 4 July the battle was renewed over the
distribution of Che's Diary. At that time the Embassy
only had 6 or 7 copies, which were being loaned out on an
overnight basis. RUIZ said he wanted to send the Diary
"to a mountain of people" while GALLO was also offering
it freely and without consulting RUIZ about the action or
his list of recipients. RUIZ scolded him roundly for this
and, ignoring GALLO's attempts at self-justification, told
him he had to respect the instructions he received. At
one point in his tirade, RUIZ even went so far as to
suggest it would be better for one of them to leave and go
to work in another country, for example Rumania. Several
interesting items emerged from this long quarrel:
A GALLO has some undefined problem which Station
Madrid assumes is related to his personality and his
approach to his fellow workers. Ruiz said, "Look,
GALLO, here everyone knows the problem you have. It
is necessary to be hard, because unfortunately all-
the comrades that have come here through many years,
know of the problem..." Ruiz then insisted on the
importance of discussing problems among the comrades
and said "for example in your case, you have been
foolish in not outlining the problem. I was waiting
and ESPINO was waiting and PILOTO".
B. RUIZ commented that now he can understand
the attitude of CALZADILLA. Before, he had thought
CALZADILLA was in error but now he feels the same way.
He mentions "an ambivalence" and says he will not
react the same way, "that CALZADILLA was wrong in
limiting himself to a reduced group of persons whereas
I will continue to go forward but with everyone, not
just a few."
C. RUIZ takes a broader view of Party membership
than his contemporaries. In commenting on the weekly
study circle for members of the Party, he set forth
his opinion that all the comrades of the local Cuban
Mission should participate even though they may not
be members because in his eyes it is as if they all
really were members.
-
D.
RUIZ repeated a statement he has made on
previous occasions the great interest of his life
is foreign commerce. However, in this 4 July QUDOZE
Report, he added the interesting detail that he had
not wanted to come to Madrid as Charge and, in affect,
had been persuaded to come against his will. He
believes he is best able to serve in the control of
industry and that is where he could perform a
tremendous work for his country as every revolutionary

ought to be in the place of work where he is able
to do the most, "Until now, I have always done
and have always gone where the revolution sent me...
with my present limitation of criteria, I should
not be here". He repeated his conviction that the
is wasting his talents and doing nothing for Cuba
in the position of Charge in comparison with what
he could do elsewhere. "I believe that with which
I am best able to serve my country is in the
1
.
control of industry...I put myself in an industry
and I see if things are being done well or if ther
are being done badly because I have knowledge and
because I arrive at my conclusions through the
accounting...look, here I am wasting my présence
and my resources when I am able to be useful to
production in another position."
By the end of this 4 July report, RUIZ had exhausted all
his combativeness and appeared very depressed.
4. RUIZ is due for home leave in Havana the first
part of August. There have been indications scattered
throughout the QUDOZE and QUTIMID Reports of the last
month or two that he might not return. The information
given in Paragraph 3-D above seems to make this
possibility even more likely and is a developement that
Station Madrid will watch closely.
H
5. The arguments ended inconclusively. Neither man.
could afford to carry the battle to the ultimate conclusion
of an open break. GALLO has tried to make some pro-forma
gestures acknowledging RUIZ as head of the Mission and
RUIZ will soon be going on home leave. However, the former
close association noted upon RUIZ's arrival is gone and
they are more distant and cool. GALLO at one point in
this same 4 July QUDOZE Report mentioned how he had looked
forward to working with RUIZ and QUDOZE had shown an
initially close working relationship between them with
daily discussions of the problems of the Mission and the
events of the day. Now, their relationship is cool,
correct and business-like. The personalities of the two
men have also come into sharper relief. RUIZ with his
quick temper, shouted and used harsh course language and
in the end got nowhere; GALLO did not raise his voice,
although his language was no improvement over that of his
boss, and tried to sound reasonable but never gave in an
inch on any of the points over which they quarreled. In..
the end nothing was resolved except possibly to clear the
air of some of the tension between the two men for in a
10 July QUDOZE Report, RUIZ was still complaining about
GALLO's friendship with Emilio ROMERO and saying that
GALLO only wanted to be out meeting people and not
preparing written memos on his work!

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT : Guillermo Orestes RUIZ Ferez (201-735296)
Cuban Charge d'Affaires in Madrid
"
According to QUDOZE/QUTIMID, Subject is suffering
+
from a spinal ailment resulting from a fall be had
about 12 years ago. Since then he has had chronic back-
aches which were particularly severe during the time that
he was in the U.S., initi, and Santo Domingo. His pains
have recurred since he arrived in Spain about six months
ago.
On 3 June he had another severe attack and was treated
by the Embassy's Spanish doctor VILLALANDA who prescribed
Cortisone. His condition was diagnosed as incurable since
it was doubted that the injury to his spice could be corrected
by an operation. Subject was further told by his doctor
that the condition would worsen to the point where within
six to 10 years he would have a defective walk. Subject
planned to send the diagnosis and x-rays to ROA in Havana
who would pass them to the Cuban specialist MARTINEZ-PAZ
for reviewing.

that in the end the victory will be theirs. He also added
that Vietnam had been at war with the Chinese for thousands
of years, that the Chinese have a demonic power that is their

1. On 10 January 1968, AMAUTO-1, in one of his many daily
discussions with his subordinates, reflected on the international
position of his country, and among the things he said, we quote
the following which may be of possible interest to addressees.

"We are demonstrating to the world that Cuba...is
favorably disposed to do whatever... (AMAUTO-1 begins
to talk against the United States) that when the
Americans have to raise the white flag...because the
first plane that appears on radar... (AMAUTO-1 is
speaking excitedly and it is very difficult to understand
each word but it appears that he is talking about the
positions of missiles in Cuba), Havana, Las Villas and
Camaguey and that with these missiles, we can cover
Miami, New York, and all their bases and all of their
"mierda". if the Americans say they are going to
sed them (missiles? planes?), we will send them; if
they (Americans) say they are going to invade us, the
first plane that comes to invade... (AMAUTO-1's sub-
ordinate remarked that 15 October 62 marked a point
in international politics, when the Yankees ordered
the Soviets to withdraw their missiles). . .(AMAUTO-1
injected) "they (the Soviets) presented them (the
Cubans) with ten bombs"
Our reason for reporting this fragmentary information is
that AMAUTO-1 might be confirming the presence of offensive mis-
siles in Cuba.
