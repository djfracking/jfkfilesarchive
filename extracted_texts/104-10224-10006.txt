Mr. McCord supervises his Division in a vigorous manner. He is capable of

because of the extensive amount of world-wide travel demanded from his subordinate:
This travel is so extensive as to result in personal hardships.

components of the intelligence community, which received special mention in his
last Fitness Report, is now at a status which warrants a designation of "Strong.
He is conscientiously working at the liaison problem in a difficult interdepartmental
atmosphere.
Mr. McCord has an excellent grasp of the technical requirements of his
position even though he is not an engineer. He has an exceptional environmental
knowledge and appreciation. He sets his goals high. He is cost conscious in the
field involving expensive equipment, which normally is costly to develop.

CERTIFICATION AND COMMENTS
3. Comments of Reviewing Official
I concur thoroughly with Mr. Winters' evaluation of Mr. McCord's
vigor and enthusiasm, skill and judgment. I would add to this that he
has demonstrated extraordinary ingenuity and leadership in supervising
the development of several new and valuable techniques in the counter-
measures field. However, I would rate him only "Proficient" in
Specific Duty Number 6, for I believe that he has not been as effective
as he might be in liaison and coordination with other components of
the Intelligence Community represented on the Technical Committee.
This is unfortunate, for it detracts from his outstanding performance
in all other elements of his assigned responsibilities. He must work
on improving these relationships and he has been counseled to this
effect by his current supervisor.

SUMMARY OF AGENCY EMPLOYMENT
JAMES W. MCCORD, JR.
Service with the Central Intelligence Agency began on 22
August 1951 and continued through-31 August 1970. During his
career there was a variety of assignments involving investigations,
research and report writing, technical and physical security programs
and a two year tour overseas.
As an investigator during the first two years of employment,
there was wide involvement in a variety of support activities requiring
initiative and ingenuity.
During the seven years engaged in research and report writing,
there was much independence of action and success depended on
initiative, imagination and resourcefulness in pioneering new areas
of interest. Beginning in May 1957, managerial responsibilities
began with appointment to a Deputy Chief position of a research staff
of some six professional and clerical personnel.
When serving overseas, responsibilities were managerial in
nature as Chief of a regional staff of some ten professional and
clerical personnel providing a full spectrum of security support.
From August 1964 to June 1965 he attended the Air War
College as representative of the Agency.
Since 1965 two vital line positions were held involving the
Agency's programs in the technical and physical security fields.
In heading up the technical security division, from 1965 to
1968, he had primary supervisory responsibility for some 40
professional and clerical personnel, preparing the budget and pro-
grams for the Agency's technical security program, and managing
the obligating of authorized funding to assure that approved programs
and goals were met. He was instrumental in guiding the development
of new approaches, in establishing new training concepts and in
bringing the Agency to a position of recognized leadership in this
field.

former Soviet intelligence personalities. This activity led to close
liaison with British and other Western intelligence representatives
involving numerous trips to Europe. This Haison activity with
representatives of the British MI-5 established a direct channel
of communications resulting in a continuous exchange of leads and
a flow of operational data over the years of benefit to the Agency.
During the period of his work with the Security Research
Staff, in which he served as Deputy Chief from May 1957, Mr.
McCord was the Agency's caso officer in a number of double agent
´casos involving Agency staff employees who had been contacted
and were being developed for recruitment by the Soviet intelligence
service.
From 1962 to 1964. Mr. McCord served overseas as Chief
of the Regional Security Support Staff located at Frankfurt, Germany
with responsibility for the overall personnel and physical security
and audio countermeasures programs applicable to the Stations and
Bases of the European area. This assignment was followed by
attendance at the Air War College, August 1964 to June 1965.
For the past five years, Mr. McCord has held two vital lino
positions with world-wide responsibilities involving the Agency's
audio countermeasures and physical security programa.
As Chief of the Technical Division from 23 July 1965 to
10 October 1968, Mr. McCord supervised a technical operation
with considerable skill. Although not an engineer by training, he
spanned a difficult gap between the administrative and technicat
demands of his responsibilities, guiding the development of useful
and esoteric equipment in the counter-audio field to a point where
the Agency became the recognised leader among Government depart-
ments in this area of activity. This leadership is evidenced by the

establishment of an Inter-Agency Technical Training Center under
the Executive Agency of the Technical Division for the Technical
Surveillance Countermeasures Committee of the United States
Intelligence Board. Much of Mr. McCord's ideas, talents, and
imagination went into the creation of this training activity which
commenced operations about the time of his reassignment to the
Physical Security Division.
Mr. McCord participated with two subordinate employees
in the development of x-ray equipment for use by the Technical
Division in detecting and locating hostile audio devices implanted
in office appurtenances and walls of Agency occupied facilities.
The responsibility for ensuring that appropriate protective methods
for the safe use of this equipment was also associated with this
development. The significance of this achievement was recognised
by the Agency when Mr. McCord and his participating colleagues
were awarded Certificates of Merit with Distinction in October 1966.
In his current position as Chief, Physical Security Division,
Mr. McCord demonstrated his ability to quickly assimilate the
necessary details of a field in which he had relatively little ex-
perience. He showed initiative in seeking out new ways and means
to harden the security of the Agency's domestic and overseas
facilities by tapping all possible technological resources, both in
and out of Government, to produce for the Agency a posture in the
physical security field which is the equal of, if not superior to, those
of other elements of the United States Government. ·Illustrative of
this effort is the expansion and improvement of the Agency's Security.
Comu.and Center relating to the protection of Agency assets in time

Throughout his Agency career, Mr. McCord has engaged
his curious and inventive mind to search out even better ways to
solve problema within his area of responsibility. As a result, his

SUBJECT
: Quality Step Increase for
Mr. James W. McCord, Jr.
4 001 isod
1. Mr. McCord has served as Chief of the Technical
Division since 23 July 1965. Through his leadership and fine
management of the Division, he and his engineers have developed
several new and valuable techniques in the audio countermeasures
field. The cost of research and development in these techniques
was at a minimum and saved the Government much time and ·
money in increasing the state of the art in audio countermeasures.
2. Mr. McCord supervises his Division in a vigorous
manner and instills enthusiasm and esprit de corps within his
organization--a difficult task because of the extensive amount
of world-wide travel demandad from his subordinates.
3. Through the efforts of Mr. McCord the establishment
of an Interagency Training Center for audio countermeasures is
proceeding in an orderly basis, and the first courses offered to
technical personnel in the intelligence community will begin this
fall. The Technical Division, PTOS, serves as the Executive
Agent for the operation of such school for the Community.
4. In view of Mr. McCord's sustained high level of
performance of duties and the outstanding achievement in the
research and development of new hardware and techniques in
the audio countermeasures field, it is recommended that
Mr. McCord be awarded a Quality Step Increase.

COURSE OBJECTIVES AND METHOD
Course objectives are to aid participants to: learn the managerial theories
contained in the Grid; understand their personal managerial styles in Grid
terms; evaluate convictions about managerial values; develop team action
skills; increase candidness of communication; strengthen the use of critique for
problem-solving and learning; and acquire an appreciation of Organization Cul-
ture and Development.
The method of learning offers a challenge to all participants regardless of
level or experience. A Grid Seminar is not "taught" in the usual sense.
In
Grid teams, participants solve complex management problems. Objective solu-
tions are made available. Individual and team performance is repeatedly
assessed. Various measuring instruments are used to evaluate effectiveness.
Critique sessions assist each participant to understand how he might change
his own behavior to increase his problem-solving effectiveness. Thus managers
are not told the best way to manage, but they learn by convincing themselves.
About twenty to thirty hours of study are completed as prework. Insights
gained are deepened and personalized during the intensive 50-hour Seminar..

Dear Dick:
I wish to express my appreciation for the valuable
assistance provided by your agency during the recent
tour of President Johnson to Southeast Asia. Your
response to our request for technical assistance was
most gratifying.
I would particularly like to commend to you Mr.
Howard J. Osborn, Director, Office of Security, Mr.
James McCord, Chief, Technical Security Division,
and Mr. Arthur Sheridan, Regional Security Office,
Far East, for their cooperation. Their dedication
to duty and extensive knowledge and experience in
technical support greatly contributed to the success
of our mission.
Messrs. Robert Prouty and William Flannery of Mr.
McCord's office and Mr. Phil Rush of Mr. Sheridan's
office also contributed immeasurably to the success
of the visit.
Please extend our sincere appreciation to your staff
for a job well done.
Sincerely,-
James J. Korley

Support Course
The Office of Security presentation at the Warrenton
Training Center on 2 March 1967 was extraordinarily well received.
Colonel Winters, Conunanding Officer, WTC, has informed me of
a number of superlative comments by those in attendance.
2. I want to express my appreciation to Messrs. James
McCord, Alan Petit, and Carroll Melkerson for their most effective
presentation on audio countermeasures. It was a highlight of the
program and contributed immeasurably to its success.
3. I'd like to oxpress a special word of thanks to Mr. William
Herron, for his splendid support in preparing visual aids for the pro-
gram on extremely short notice. I am aware that Bill worked long
hours over the preceding weekend and virtually all night on one
occasion in order to ensure the success of this program, while ful-
filling heavy commitments to get audio countermeasures teams into
the field.
4. I can be justifiably proud of the success of the presentation,
and attribute this success in large part to the extraordinary team effort
by the Office of Security components involved. Please extend my per-
sonal commendation to Messrs. McCord, Petit, Melkerson, and Herron
and advise them that a copy of this memorandum will be placed in their
Official Personnel Files.

-
From early December 1965 through May, 1966, Messrs. James W. McCord,
Jr., Alan F. Petit, and William M. Marcy of the Technical Division, Office
of Security, conceived and developed a unique technique for the use of a
small portable X-ray machine which has been placed in extensive use in
the Agency's Audio-Countermeasures Program. Experimentation during these
months indicated that X-ray combined with a fluorescopic screen had distinct
advantages in terms of time and effort over the considorably more expon-
sive X-ray film and processor. Along with this, they designed an innova-
tion in the form of a fluoroscopic cloth which has the distinct advantage
of flexibility over the fluorescent screons currently available on the
commercial market.
The combination of the X-ray and the fluorescent cloth make it pos-
sible to rapidly scan in "real time" large wall surfaces and furnishings,
a capability the Agency has not had before.
The Technical Division has greatly enhanced the world-wide use of
this equipmont in that they designed and developed a packaging plan where-
by using two attacho cases they are able to easily transport the X-ray
fluoroscopic equipment, wall racks, and motor units making it possible to
inconspicuously carry it into offices; residences, and safehouses.
These men have shown initiative, ingenuity and great imagination in
the application of fluoroscopic scanning with X-ray.
This technique, much of which required many off-duty hours to develop,
has greatly enhanced the Agency's capability to detect clandestine micro-
phones and other devices targeted against the Agency
Agency both domestically
and oversens.

Dear Jin:
y tour of duty in Readquarters, United States Army,
Europe will terminate in late ´ay when I leave Europe to
undertake new duties in Wasidigton, D. C. My association
with you and your staff has been a richly rewarding export-
ence, both personally and professionally. The manner in
which you have unobtrusively, yet effectively, served as the
catalyst which welded together the activities of the many
staff and operational agencies which share an interest in
our national security, has been a source of continuing in-
spiration to me. Your efforts have enjoyed my unqualified
personal support and have merited the admiration of those
members of my staff who have been privileged to associate
with you.
You have dramatically de monstrated a capacity for
bringing together key personnel of agencies who seek, in
the accomplishment of their individual missions, the real-
ization of a common goal, in a manner calculated to pre-
serve the individual integrity of each agency while exploiting
those benefits of cohesiveness so essential to maxi sum
effectiveness. indful that the application of a prescribed
technique without adding the couple centing ingredient of
your confidence inspiring and persuasive personality would
not have achieved the sa e Leasure of success, I unlesi-
tatingly ascribe our abundant joint acco plish ents to your
generous personal contribution.

On the departure of Mr. James W. McCord I wanted you to know of

his tour. He has given us valuable assistance in the performance
of our mission.
We appreciate also Mr. McCord's constant efforts to create unity of

agencies in the area. Through his efforts new liaison avenues were
opened to OSI which, on several occasions, facilitated the completion
of our tasks. His efforts in contingency planning also were noteworthy.
Please extend our good wishes

MC CORD). James
10 March 1969
I want to express my appreciation to you personally
and through you to Howard Osborn and the other of your as-
sociates who contributed so effectively to the visit of the
President on Friday. The arrangements were flawless; the

first-class without being intrusive. I am well
of the amount of work and planning which went into
the successful outcome. I particularly want to commend the
good sense and judgment which prevailed throughout. It is
easy to push people around. It is difficult to take proper
precautions and at the same time make everyone feel as though
it vore his or her party. Thank you very much. Well donel

MEMORANDUM FOR:

SUBJECT
Security Support During
-President Nixon's Visit
1. I have received numerous and highly complimentary com-
ments from the Director, the Executive Director and the Acting
Deputy Director for Support for the role this Office played during the
In addition,
visit of President Nizon to the Agency on 7 March 1969.
Mr. Don Gautreau, the Secret Service Agent responsible for protec-
tive measures during the visit, told me that he had never met a more
highly professional group of personnel than our Security officers.
He was impressed with the comprehensive coverage inherent in our
protective measures.
2. Our performance on Friday was smooth, efficient and
effective and once more is a tribute to our ability to rise to any
occasion. This is possible only because of the quality of the effort
put forth by each Security Officer who participated. I am very proud
of all of you and I would like to particularly commend Jim McCord,
Bill Wilkinson and Jim Greene for the work they did in planning our
role in the ceremonies. Equally impressive was the performance of
Hollis Whitaker and his people in the provision of audio coverage of
the event.
3. I would like to have copies of this memorandum placed in
the official Personnel File of every individual who participated in
making this event such a great success.

other interested components of this Agency as they are completed.
Questions wore solicited by this Office of all interested components,
in order to cover all matters in the debriefings of interest to the
Agency. Careful arrangements have been made with the Air Force in
order that Agency interests will be adequately protected and proper
security will be maintained in the handling of information and reports
derived from the debriefings, and so that no compromise of the Agency
interest in the flight of the C-118 will be made to the press.
•
CONCLUSIONS:
A.
It is our opinion that the possible compromises arising out of
this incident are relatively minor in nature and that no major
compromises occurred.
B. That the Soviets "missed" on the true nature of the flight and
personnel of the C-118.
C. That the reasons the crew members were given an early release
were as follows:
1. Primarily, the Soviet interrogators failed to use all
of the leads at their command, particularly Brannon's
address book, and failed to break the crewmen through
interrogation.
2. The crew did not inadvertently disclose through in-
terrogations, the purpose of their flight, its relation
to the Agency and that of three of its crew to CIA..
3. The Soviets apparently failed to check out the names
and other data in Brannon's address book through their
files prior to release of the crew.
4. No incriminating information or material was immediately
recovered from the burned aircraft.
5. Several of the crew destroyed incriminating building
passes and notations in their wallets while on their
way down in their parachutes, or immediately after
landing in their chutes.
6. There were either no leaks or insufficient leaks of
incriminating information through any room conversa-
tions &t Baku among the crew, which may have been moni-
tored by the Soviets, or such conversations as there
may have been were not properly interpreted, or inter-
preted soon enough to tip the Soviets that there was
something unusual about the flight or the crew.

SUBJECT: ⠀ American C-118 Aircraft Downed in Soviet
Azerbaijan 27 June 1958 by Soviet MIG-17's
1 November 1958.
:
On 27 Jun 1958, a C-118 cargo plane, assigned to the U. 8. Air
Force in Wiesbaden, was fired on and forced down near Cendarkh, Soviet
Azerbaijan. The plane was carrying nine U. S. airmen, three of whom
are assigned to this Agency. They are Colonel Dale D. Brannon, Major
Robert E. Crans and Major Bennie. A. Shupe. The other six men were
regular Air Force members assigned to Wiesbaden, Germany. The nine mon
were en route from Wiesbaden to Teheran and Pakistan on a flight carry-
ing cargo for CIA. Col. Brannon and Major Crans were planning to get off.
the plane in Teheran had the plane remained on course.
The plane, while en route to Teheran from Nicosia and as a result
of bad weather and navigation error, went off its plotted course and
crossed into Soviet Armenia. There it was intercepted and fired on by
three MIG-17's and caught fire in the left wing. Five of the crew bailed
out and the other four rode the aircraft down to a safe landing on a
small airstrip at Gendarkh in Soviet Azerbaijan. The crew members who
had remained on the plane to its landing got out safely and the plane
was burning fiercely when the crew last saw it. The part of the crew
that parachuted was surrounded by Soviet peasants, some of whom beat and
struck at the crew members. One of the men, Major Bennie Shupe, CIA
employee, was taken by the mob to a telephone pole and narrowly escaped
hanging before being rescued by the Soviet military.
Major Shupe and the remainder of the crew were turned over to the
Soviet military, and after an overnight stay in a Soviet military
garrison near Stepanakert were taken to a city believed to be Yevlakh,..
and then flown to Baku, Russia. There they underwent interrogation by
Soviet intelligence officers, at least one of whom had served in the
United States, as a Soviet Purchasing Commission employne 1943-45, and
later in Canada in 1949-55 as First Secretary of the Soviet Embassy.
This RIS officer, Vladimir Bourdine, later served in 1955 as a personal
interpreter for Thrushchev in a meeting with Prime Minister Nehru of
India. Bourdine interrogated Colonel Brannon of CIA at considerable
length during the period 30 June 3 July 1958, while the crew was in-
prisoned in the MVD Headquarters building in Baku. Following their
individual interrogations, the crew members were required to appear
separately before a Commission of Soviet officials at the Baku MVD
Headquarters who questioned them about the border violation by the
C-118 aircraft, and requested them to sign statements attesting that
they had been well-treated and received adequate medical care by the

Soviets. The inquiry by the Commission was perfunctory and did not
involve an interrogation in the intelligence sense. The crew was
then transported to Astara on the Soviet-Iranian border on 7 July
1958 and turned over to the American Air Attache:
-
At
On 2 July 1958 this Agency received information_indicating that
the Soviets might be considering releasing the nine fliers. Since no
date or place of release was indicated, cables were sent to the various
peripheral CIA stations around the Soviet border indicating the possi-
bility of impending relenco. The Air Force agreed to alort its Air
Attaches in the same areas of the possibility of impending release.
the same time a team of Agency personnel, including a medical officer,
an Air Maritime officer, and two representatives of the Security Office
were dispatched to Wiesbaden from Headquarters in anticipation of the
release of the fliers. Three hours after the team arrived in Germany,
the place of release was learned from the Soviets to be Astara on the
Soviet-Iranian border, and a USAFE plane was dispatched that night from
Wiesbaden with the Air Maritime team member aboard destined for
Teheran to await the turnover of the American fliers at Astara. The
fliers were turned over on 7 July 1958, were immediately flown to
Wiesbaden, Germany where an initial joint CIA-AF debriefing of them
was begun, and where initial press interviews were held, following
careful briefing of the crow as to the text and limitations to be
observed. Two days later, two members of the crew, one of whom was
Major Shupe, a CIA employee, were permitted to give an interview to the
Paris representative of Time-Lifo. Members of the CIA team were pre-
sent during these press Interviews, under appropriate cover arrangements,
to furnish guidance to the CIA personnel.
Following the initial debriefing, the entire crew was flown to
Washington, D. C. on 18 July 1958, for a more extended debriefing.
These debriefings were completed on 6 August 1958 and covered the
various aspects of possible compromise of the security of CIA
personnel, operational and cover units activities, as well as various
positive intelligence and counter-intelligence matters.
The three CIA men aboard the plane were extremely knowledgeable
of highly sensitive Agency operational activities and of the identities
of numerous CIA personnel. Colonel Brannon, as Commander of the CIA
Air Support Operations in Europe, was knowledgeable of CIA operational
activities on a world-wide bania, with many of these projects being
extremely sensitive. Colonel Brannon and Major Robert Crans each
carried briefcases containing classified material, and Brannon carried
an address book containing several names, addresses and telephone
numbers of CIA personnel and cover units. The two briefcases are
believed to have been destroyed by the fire in the aircraft after
landing. The address book of Brannon was taken from him by the Soviet

peasants on landing and was later turned back to him by the Soviet
-Commission-members at Bāku. Neither he nor other members of the crew
were questioned about either of the briefcases, their contents, nor
about the address book and its contents. We assume that the Soviets
have or will process the names in the address book through their Moscow
files. Some of the other crew members carried personal notations in
their wallets relating to a few other CIA personnel.
We have received no indications that Colonel Brannon or the other
crewmen were drugged or otherwise tampered with by the Sovieta.
and some of the others did receive shots the first night and second day
Brannon
from the Soviet military for their wounds and burns; however, these
shots are believed to have been for legitimate medical reasons.
The substance of the questioning, treatment and techniques of
interrogation has been exhaustively explored with all the crew members
in the course of the debriefings. In summation,
In summation, the interrogations
of the crew members were superficial and do not appear to have been
backed up by close coordination and communication with Moscow for
intelligence research purposes. It is possible that the quick ac-
knowledgment by the Soviet Foreign Office of the landing of the C-118
in Soviet territory precluded the MVD from fully exploiting the crew
members. Colonel Brannon and Captain Kane were separated from the
group and given preferred treatment, apparently with the intention of
developing them for information purposes. We are convinced that both
men handled themselves extremely well and did not disclose any infor-
mation concerning the Agency or its activities.
To date we have no indication that the Soviets knew at the time
they interrogated the crew men, that the flight of the C-118 was con-
nected with CIA in any way, nor that they knew. three of the men aboard
were CIA personnel. We do believe that in time the Soviets, through
Brannon's address book, which lists the open Agency telephone number
EX 3-6115 below his name on the first page, will connect him and
possibly others in the address book with CIA. Since the Soviets
questioned him about the 7170th Support Group and the 7405th Support
Squadron in Wiesbaden, it is therefore presumed that they will asso-
clate those units with this Agency.

7. The crew members were all in uniform and not in mixed
civilian and Air Force clothing, which properly estab-
-lished their cover.
8. Sufficient pressures were exercised by Agency, State,
Air Force, and Executive action upon the Soviets to
effect the release of the crew-as-soon-as-ponsible.
9. A factor that probably had an important bearing was the
early acknowledgment by the Soviet Foreign Office of
the downing of the aircraft and the attempte by the
Soviets in the early stages to make this appear as a
deliberate violation of the Soviet air frontier. This
tended to take the "play" away from the MVD and military
intelligence. In addition, this Government was stepping
up the pressure for the release of the nine Army person-
nel who landed in East Germany in a helicopter, and the
Soviets probably had no desire to create a duplicate of
this incident.
10. Safeguards taken by the Agency and the Air Force were
such that there was no leak to the press, during the
crew's internment, of the fact that there was an in-
telligence connection of the flight and crew of the
C-118.
That it is not believed, based on the evidence at hand, that
the crew was drugged or otherwise tampered with medically.
That there are valuable points of guidance from a cover, opera-
tions, policy and code of conduct standpoint which can be
gathered from experiences of these cremen in the hands of the
Soviets and can aid the Agency and its personnel in any future
situation of a similar nature in which the Soviet military and
RIS interrogators are encountered.
ACTION TAKEN TO SAFEGUARD AGENCY INTEREST IN THIS MATTER:
Ai All possible steps were taken during the period immediately
preceding and immediately after the release of the crew to
effect the minimum of publicity and to safeguard and limit
such publicity as was given out, in order to avoid disclos-
ing the CIA connection of the flight and some of its crew.
· B. Throughout the entire debriefing process in Germany and in
the U. S., the maximum care has been taken to safeguard
the information taken by transcript and classify it so that
there would be access to the information therein on a need-
to-know basis and by only properly cleared persons.

Reference is made to the attached memorandum dated 1 November 1958, which is
the summary excerpted from the report of the operation submitted on that date.
Upon receipt of information, 2 July 1958, that a member of the Soviet-Foreign Office
in Moscow had mentioned to one of the American Embassy staff members that the Soviets
had knowledge of the crew of the missing C-lls, Mr. McCord was appointed head of a team
of men from Headquarters to proceed immediately to Germany to plan for and debrief the
crew of the C-118 in case they were released.
At Wiesbaden, acting upon polic guidance received from Headquarters, Mr. McCord made
detailed plans for the interrogation of crew members; prepared news releases and made
plans for the handling of the press; arranged for reunion of the crew members with their
families; and arranged medical examinations, all with the view toward avoiding publicity
or incidents which might reveal Central Intelligence Agency interest in the highly
sensitive nature of the plane's flight.
When the crew arrived at Wiesbaden, Mr. McCord directed the over-all interrogations
and participated in portions of the interrogation of the crew members himself. He pre-
pared cables and dispatches for Headquarters as well as the over-all report of the de-
briefing of the crew. He briefed the crew members regarding their conduct before the
press. He also assisted in the plans for the return of the crew members to Washington,
all of which entailed around-the-clock work.
Upon return to Washington, Mr. McCord directed the detailed debriefing of the crew,
covering all aspects of possible compromise of security of CIA personnel, operations, and
cover unit activities, as well as various positive intelligence and counter-intelligence
matters. Final reports were prepared and Mr. McCord participated in briefings of the DCI,
DDCI, and various Air Force and Defense Department officials.
The ingenuity, foresight, planning and guidance exercised by Mr. McCord from the time
the team first left for Europe, through the initial debriefing, and then in following
through in the debriefings back at Headquarters, resulted in rapid and thorough inter-
view of the crew members, assessment of the compromice to the Agency, and determination
of appropriate action needed by the Agency to counter such compromise. His performance
in that instance was of the highest degree and did mich credit to this Agency in the
highly professional manner in which it was performed.

C. Steps were taken imediately by the German-Station-after-
the downing of the C-113 to change the combinations of
the safes and locks in the buildings to which the crew
had acces8.
D.
The three mon from this Agency who were aboard the flight,
Brannon, Crans and Shupe, and the aircraft commander, Lyles,.
are being removed from the German area, being returned to
the U. S. The three CIA crewmen are being returned to duty
with the Air Force from the Agency.
E. Steps are continuing to be taken to properly safeguard
Agency interests and personnel in regard to names of Agency
personnel who appeared in Brannon's address book or in other
notations appearing in any papers carried by other members
of the crew.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
A.
Continue to take all possible steps to prevent any disclosure
to any unauthorized persons, particularly the press, about the
CIA personnel aboard the C-118, or the true nature of the
flight.
B. Continue to take all possible steps to change the cover desig-
nation of the units appearing in Brannon's address book to
prevent any further compromise of these units.

C. Permit no further publicity about the flight itself, in order
to minimize the possibility of the press learning of the CIA
interest in the flight of the C-118.1
D. Carefully follow all matters relating to the International
Court of Justice interest in this flight, in order to prevent
any compromise of Agency interests.

Dear Mr. Osborn:
On 8 November 1967, Messrs. James McCord, William Flannery,

This presentation was most enlightening and proved to be
of keen interest to the Agency HCS Representatives, staff
members of the Office of the Manager, NCS and selected
key personnel of the Defense. Communications Agency.
'
We very much appreciate the availability of the above
personnel and I should like to commend them on
mentioned personnel and
their excellent manner of presentation and thorough knowledge
of the subject matter.

Honorable Richard M. Helms

Dear Dick:
I want to thank you for the technical security
demonstration recently presented to me by Howie Osborn
and members of his staff. We are very conscious of the
subject and welcome opportunities to be kept up-to-date
on the state-of-the-art.
I would appreciate your also conveying my personal
thanks to Messrs. Frank Farrell, James McCord, and their
assistants, not only for the high degree of professionalism
which they demonstrated during the session here but also
for their continued advice and assistance to my security
organization. I am sure you join me in encouraging continued
close liaison of this type.
Faithfully yours,
Fal

Mr. James W. McCord, Jr.
SUBJECT
:
..
Head of 88 Career Service
Notification of Non-eligibility for Designation as a
Participant in the CIA Retirement and Disability System
.
1. As you may know, we are in the process of reviewing the employment
history and current career field of all employees in the Agency to identify
those who are eligible for designation as a participant in the new CIA
Retirement and Disability System. In this process, the initial review of
each case is made by the individual's Career Service.
Career Service nominates him for participation in the system, this nomina-
If the Head of his
tion is reviewed by the CIA Retirement Board which recommends final action
to me. However, if the Head of the Career Service advises that the employee
does not meet the basic requirements of HR 20-50 for participation, I have
accepted this finding without further review by the CIA Retirement. Board.
This practice has been adopted in the interest of expediting this screening
process so that those employees who are eligible to participate in the sys-
tem may be designated participants as soon as possible.
2.
In your case, the Head of your Career Service has advised me that
you do not meet the requirements of HR 20-50 for designation as a partici-
pant and I have accordingly made the formal determination required by the
regulation that you are not eligible for designation.
record it appears that the decision of your Career Service was based upon
From a review of your
the fact that you do not have sufficient time prior to completing 15 years
of service with the Agency in which you could complete a minimum of 60 months
of qualifying service as required by regulation. My determination that you
are not eligible at this time for designation in no way affects your current ·
status under the Civil Service Retirement System, nor does it preclude recon-
sideration of your eligibility to participate in the CIA System if you should
meet the requirements for designation in the future.
3. Should you desire further information concerning the requirements
for designation as a participant in the CIA Retirement System, I suggest that
you read paragraph e of HR 20-50 and paragraph 5 of the Employee Bulletin
dated 30 July 1965, entitled "Public Law 88-643, The Central Intelligence
Agency Retirement Act of 1964 for Certain Employees."
4. It is always possible that the records upon which the determination-
made_in_your_case may have been incomplete or inaccurate regarding your actual
employment history with the Agency. If, after studying the materials cited
above, you have questions regarding the determination that you are not eligi-
ble to participate in the CIA Retirement System, please feel free to contact
officials of your Career Service. They are familiar with the details of your
case and will gladly discuss them with you. In addition, you may wish to dis-
cuss your case with the CIA Retirement Staff located in Room 6E-1319 Head-
quarters (extension 6001). If such discussions do not resolve any questions
you have regarding your eligibility, you may request that your case be formally
considered by the Board. However, this request must be made within 30 days of
the date of this memorandum.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT:. Retirement
-
James W. McCord, Jr.
31 August 1970
↓. The retirement of Subject, effected as a result of a
memorandum from the Head of his Career Service stating that
he is surplus to the needs of the Service and that his retire-
ment will be recommended to the Director under the provisions
of the CIA Retirement and Disability System pertaining to in-
voluntary retirement, in no way implies an adverse action.
Subject signed an application for retirement of his own volition
in order to qualify for an immediate retirement annuity. The
liberalized criteria for such separations was established by
the Agency to parallel similar actions under the Civil Service
Retirement System in accordance with FPM Letter No. 831-23,
dated 10 December 1969.
2. Any inquiry received concerning the nature of the sep-
aration of Subject from the Agency should be confirmed simply
as a retirement.

Rockville, Maryland 20850
Dear Mr. McCord:
It is the practice of the Organization to follow up with
former employees six months after their retirement. We hope
by such inquiry to obtain information on what our retirees
are doing and where they are located, invite suggestions for
improving the retirement program and to learn if the Organi-
zation might be of some assistance on any post-retirement
matters.
We should like very much to hear from you on the above
points and on any other topics you think would be useful to
ug
For your convenience in replying, we have enclosed a
sheet somewhat akin to a form on which we have listed those
standard items of information we'd like to have on every re-
tiree. The remainder of the sheet, including the reverse
side, is for your comments and suggestions. We shall be
most appreciative of your fullest response to this inquiry,
Thank you very much for your cooperation.
Sincerely yours,

principled individual who once convinced he has hit upon the proper
course of action will usually yield only by direction, We've discussed
this, and I've noted a determined effort on his part to broaden his
tolerance for other opinions.
5. Overall, the employee has made a substantial contribution
to the Office of Security by his dedication to his job, his tenacious
attitude toward upgrading our physical security standards, a curious
and inventive mind ever searching for better ways to solve a problem
in his area of responsibility, and a cost consciousness in the admini -
stration of his division. I rate him an overall "Strong.

his first full year as Chief, Physical Security Division. During
Mr. McCord completed
1969 the Division underwent many changes, a direct result of the
personal efforts of this employee. He has shown the initiative
to seek out new ways and means to harden the security of our
domestic and overseas facilities by tapping all possible tech-
nological sources both in and out of Government. His efforts
have produced tangible results and in my judgment, our posture
in the physical security field is far superior to any of our con-
temporaries.
2. With the spiraling costs of manpower, Mr. McCord
has concentrated on the potential for use of technical devices to
replace the human asset. He has made reniarkable inroads into
this field by way of imagination, ingenuity and drive.
3. Mr. McCord has the quality to inspire his subordinates.
He is demanding, but understanding. On more than one occasion.
he was asked to take under his wing employees who were labeled
"problems. Through personal interest and effort, he has salvaged
the majority of these individuals to a point where they are performing
in a highly satisfactory manner.
"
4. In the previous fitness report, I alluded to the fact that
employee has a tendency to find it difficult to see another person's
point of view. This, I feel, is attributable to an innate stubbornness
which obviously is difficult to overcome. Mr. McCord is a very

Fitness Report
1. This is an annual fitness report covering the period
1 April 1968 through 31 March 1969. During the first period of
this report, Mr. McCord served as the Chief, Technical Division/
PTOS and continued to display a very high degree of professionalism
in administering the Agency's world-wide Audio Countermeasures
(ACM) program. Under his guidance, several new devices and
techniques were developed which have helped the Agency and the
intelligence community to maintain pace with the sophisticated
advances by the opposition in the field of positive audio.
2. Mr. McCord initiated the necessary planning for the
activation of the Interagency Training Center (ITC) which provides
ACM instruction to all members of the community in the latest of
equipment and techniques.
3. On 14 October 1968, he was reassigned to the position
of Chief, Physical Security Division. Although he had relatively
little experience in this particular field, he has quickly assimilated
the necessary details to manage this Agency effort. He has taken
steps toward the development, and use of the most advanced physical
security equipment and techniques to protect the Agency. Under
the supervision of Mr. McCord, the Agency Security Command
Center operations have been expanded and improved. He has been
assigned the responsibility to organize and direct the Security efforts
relating to the protection of Agency assets in time of demonstrations,
riots, and other civil disturbances. He coordinated the Agency
Security effort with the U. S. Secret Service in protection of the
President of the United States during his recent visit to the CIA
Headquarters.

4. Mr. McCord is considered to be economical in his use
of equipment, manpower and funds.
5. Perhaps one of the stronger attributes this employee
possesses is his ability to organize. In a relatively short time.
he has deliberated the Physical Security Division's mission and
already taken steps to restructure it within existing manpower
limitations to more effectively react to its responsibilities.
6. He inspires his subordinates and has the respect of his
superiors. There have been instances, however, when Mr. McCord
has exhibited a certain intolerance with individuals who do not agree
with his point of view, resulting in some friction in their working
relations. There has been much improvement in this regard, and
I do not feel it will present any problem in the future.
7. I anticipate this employee will continue to absorb know-
ledge and experience in the physical security field at the rapid rate
he has during his short tenure and am confident his efforts will
result in a major contribution to the Office and Agency. I rate
Mr. McCord a high "Strong."
