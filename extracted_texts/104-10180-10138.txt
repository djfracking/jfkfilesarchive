1. The SW cupplies and instructions needed to establish two-way SW
correspondence with ARE are transmitted herevith. We realize that some of
the instruction forms and supplies which are being transmitted are duplicates
of those sent to the Station in support of other operations. Powever, in order
to facilitate the handling of each operation, the supplies for each are
furnished as a complete unit. This will preclude the need for berrowing from
one agent's supplies to outfit another.

12. AMIRE will write to the Cuse Officer, using carbon system $39337.
Two unused sheets of carbon #37337 should be issued to the agent for this
purpose. He should be told to store them separately to avoid accidental loss,
of his writing system. His carbon system is developed by means of tablet
#30607. A supply of the developer material, in quantities sufficient for
training purposes, accompanies this dispatch.
3. According to the UII operational plan, SW messages written by AMIRE 1
will be mailed to accommodation addresses in various Latin American countries
In accordance with that, KURIOT will provide the appropriate (Will Field Station) 28
with the materials necessary for developing the operational messages.
99
4. AMERE will develop the SW messages he receives by means of (Pill
#58838.) P should be issued (twenty pills #58838 for that purpose. It is
99
recommended that the agent be told to hide his developer materials in a safe
place: This should not present much of a problem because the pills are so 99
small. We do not generally recommend that (pills be cancuflaged as medicines.)99
Even in cases where the SW ingredient (does have a bona fide medicinal usage,
the concentration represented by the SW pill would usually be in excess of the 19
Formal dosage, and thus there would be a dancer of having an unwitting person
use them by accident.qqIf the Cuse Officer feels that for operational reasons
it is desirable (to camouflage then as medicines) they should only be kept in a
bottle which is clearly marked (FOR SIAL USE ONLY) 99
5. According to the operational plau, the are to ecent : ncssages will
be prepared for the Area Division by KURIOT at Headquarters. The Area Division
will pouch the pessages (2 "blank" sheets of stationery) & the appropriate
Field Station for application of the cover test and wailing.

6. The Axial Case Officer should familiarize himself with the
accompanying supplies and instructions before any attempt is made to train and
issue supplies to the agent. Experience has shown that it is advisable to plan
for two or three chort (2 hour) scent training sessions scheduled over e period
of days, rather than to attempt to crun the training into one long session.

7. Special attention should be given to plaming the cover correspondence.
