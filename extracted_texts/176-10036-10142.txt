THE ONLY OPENING TO THE BUNKER, OTHER THAN A HEAVY DOOR, IS THE
VENTILATION SYSTEM AND THE COUP GROUP HESITATES TO USE FLAME
THROWERS OR POISON GAS BECAUSE THEY PREFER TO TAKE DIEM ALIVE.
D. THE REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE NOW INCLUDES LANG AND GENERALS
KHIEM, KHANH, AND DUONG VAN MINH GENERAL TRI HAS AGREED TO JOIN
