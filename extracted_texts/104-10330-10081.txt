1. Subject was born on 17 March 1913 in New Orleans,
Louisiana.
2. Standard background information on Subject
(parents, marital status, records of education and
employment, etc.) is lacking because SHAW was a contact
of the Domestic Contact Service.
3. Traces on Subject have been run in RID/Main
Index, the index of the Office of Security and the
Central Cover Staff. The first showed only a 1951 FBI
interview with SHAW about a former employee of the New
Orleans International Trade Mart. The second showed
that 00/Contacts Division had requested a name trace :
· about 1949 and that the check of FBI records then aon-
ducted was negative. Central Cover Staff had no record.

No relationship to the Garrison investigation

World Trade Center and Fermidex are

He was subpoenaed by Garrison's office

There was a fuss and SHAW was arrested

SHAW to him. J.. Monroe SULLIVAN, executive director of
the San Francisco World Trade Center, told the Associated
Preas that SHAW was in San Francisco and touring the
Canter with him on the day of the assassination.
SHAW,
now retired, was formerly the managing director of the
International Trade Mart in New Orleans, He is 54 years
old. Ramsey Clark, U.S. Attorney General, said that the
FBI had investigated SHAW late in 1963. 'On the evidence
that the FBI has, there was no connection found" with the
assassination.

New Orleans office seven times in 1949,
twice in 1950, five times in 1951, nine
times in 1952, once in 1953, twice in 1954,
twice in 1955, and twice in 1956. SHAW

Mr. CHAYES. No; I think in each case it will depend so much on the altostion
with the particular person. If a person comes in and be is very agitated or
something of that kind, it might dictate a totally different approach than a differ-
ent kind of thing:
Mr. DULLES. Wouldn't it be useful though to give-I don't want to suggest
what the Secretary of State should do in this, but in the light of this experi-
ence, would there not be some benefit possibly in giving people in the field the
result of the experience gained in this particular case?
Mr. CHAYES. Well, the general approach, and other matters related to it,
are touched on in orientation courses for consular officers and so on. I think
ms I look on Consul Snyder's actions, that he behaved very much like a respon-
Bible Foreign Service officer.
That happened long before I was in the Department, so I can say that
without any involvement.. But it seemed to me that he did just what he
should have done, despite the unfortunate aftermath. And it shows to me, at
least, that the training and orientation that these people are getting is right, is
serviceable, and they are able to handle these situations as they come in.”“.
Mr. DULLA. I realize that you ought not to prescribe hard and fast rules,
that there is a broad range of discretion that should be exercised here. But I
Just raise the question as to whether a good deal of experience basn't been gained
in this case in that very fleld.
Mr. CHAYES Well, it may very well be that more attention to that particular
aspect should be given in the orientation courses and so on. Those things
tend to reflect what is hot at the moment you know, and if you haven't had
trouble with something for a pretty long time, it tenda maybe not to get
mentioned. -
Representative Form. If Oswald bad persisted that day, October 81, in de-
manding the form that is a prerequisite under your definition for renunciation,
would Snyder have been required to give it to him and permit him to sign it?
Mr. CRATES. I think if it had been in ordinary office hours when the con-
silate was open for business, and if Snyder was satisfied that he was competent,
that Oswald was competent, he would have to give him the form, yes, kir.
Regresentative Forn. Does Snyder. have the authority to make a determina-
tion of competency?
Mr: CHAYES, No; he doesn't have the authority to make a determination of
competence, and I suppose it is possible at some point to get the issue tried in
court. But I think a consular officer would probably be acting within his
discretion if he saw sombody who was drunk or raving or something and just
said, "Well, I am not going to give you this until I am sure that your action is
your act. After all, when the consul accepts the oath, he is certifying that it
is the act of the person in a meaningful sense, and so if he thought that the
person was incompetent, I think he would have discretion not to give the oath,
But I put that far aside because in the particular case bere, Mr. Snyder made it
perfectly clear that he had no reason to doubt that Oswald was fully competent.
And so it Oswald had been there at a time when the office was open, or had
returned at a time when the office was open, and had persisted in his demand,
I think Snyder would have been under an obligation to give him the form.
Representative Fun. The only technical reason or basis upon which Boyder
could have denied Oswald the right that day was the fact that it was on a
Saturday, a non-working-hour period of the Embassy.
b
Mr. CHATES. Yes; I think he had every right to try to dissuade him, or per-
suade him not to act or persuade him to think it over and come back the next
day. But if after all of that Oswald still had said "But I want to do it now"
and if the office was open for business, then I think he would have bad to do it.
Mr. Duixes. I think it might be useful if it has not been done to introduce
at this point as an exhibit the form of oath of remunciation. Here is the for
malized oath and I think it would be well to have this in our records unless
It is already in our records.
Representative Foxn, I agree.
Mr. COLEMAN. No; it isn't. Could we say it will be marked as Commission
Exhibit No. 955 and place this sticker on that page, photostat it and then just
sand it hank
5.
(Commission Exhildt No. 955 was marked for identification and received in

Representative Form. When Oswald came back on November 3, 1 believe, which
was a regular working day
Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. Commissioner, he did not come back on November B. He
merely wrote a letter.
Mr. CHAYER, Wrote a letter. He never came back.
Representative Fun. Are all of the employees, Mr. Snyder, Mr. McVekar,
and, the others who had any. firsthand contact with the Orwald case to this
area, were they State Department employees? ...
Mr. CRATES. Yes, sir; these two men, who, were the only ones who did see
him directly, I think the secretary, their secretary also saw him, but had nothing
to do with him except as a receptionist. These two men were Foreign Serv-
ice officers and are now Foreign Bervice officers.
Representative For. In the strictest term.
Mr. CHATIS. Yes, pir; members of the Foreign Service, appointed
President with the advice and consent of the Benate.
Representative For Could you tell us in a bit more detall the process that
your followed or the procedure that you carried out when you first got into the
Oswald case.
You mentioned yesterday you got a call or you were directed by I belleve
the Secretary of State or by somebody in bigher authority to take certain steps.
Will you tell us who called you, what you did in the first 3 or 4 days?
Mr. CHAYIS.. It was the evening of the day, perhaps about 5 o'clock on the
day of the assassination. It may have been somewhat earlier, because I think
I remember I went home for an hour and then came back to carry out this
assignment. Mr. Ball, once it became known that Oswald had some history as

But even if he had been the Under Becretary he is my client.
Representative Forn. He still had some authority.
Mr. CHATES. Yes; be directed me to gather together the files in the Department
on Oswald, and to prepare a report to be available for him the first thing in the
morning covering as best we could within that time span the contacts that
Oswald had with the Department.
We got the passport file. We got the security office file. We got the special
consular services file which covered Mrs. Oswald's visa and the repatriation
loan: I think those three files were the ones that we bad. It may have been
there was a smaller fourth file, but I think those three were the ones.
Representative FORD. What would that smaller fourth file be?
Mr. CHAYES, I can't remember. It was duplicates if it was anything. Oh, that
is right, we bad a visa file and an BCS file so those were the four. The SCS

To the extent that there were any backchannel communications for the
time periods 27 Sept - 16 Oct 1963 and 22 Nov - 30 Nov. 1963 (other than
those currently contained in the JFK Collection), please make such records
available for review.
Why has it been so difficult to answer these questions?
15. ARRB's Request for Additional Information and Record No. CIA-14, dated
December 23, 1996, documented our request for the annual or biannual Station reports
for Mexico City Station for 1963 and 1964. Why has it been so difficult to provide these
reports?
16. The attached Agency document released in 1996 contains the paragraph:
11. A memorandum marked only for file, 16 March 1967, signed M.D.
Stevens, says that J. Monroe SULLIVAN, #280207, was granted a covert
security approval on 10 December 1962 so that he could be used in Project
QKENCHANT. (Clay) Shaw has #402897-A.
What do these numbers mean? What does the "A" at the ends of Shaw's number
signify? Do the files identified by these numbers still exist? Why was Sullivan granted
a covert security approval?
17. During the period 1959-1963, what was the purpose or goal of QKENCHANT?
18. Under what circumstances were non-agency employees given covert security
clearances for the QKENCHANT project?
19. Did Clay Shaw receive a covert security approval for the QKENCHANT project?
Why was one needed? Did Clay Shaw receive covert security clearances for any
project other than QKENCHANT
20. What did Clay Shaw do within the QKENCHANT project?
21. Do records exist to account for the disposition of all files on Clay Shaw?
22. Did Howard Hunt have any involvement with the QKENCHANT project prior to
1964?
23. Did J. Monroe Sullivan have any involvement with the QKENCHANT project prior
to 1964?

8. We have seen DDP monthly operational reports which contain information on the
allocation/distribution of operational funds. Are there other DDP records which would
reflect how certain projects utilized their funding? How are these records organized?
How should a search query be framed?
9. Various open sources have linked the CIA to various journalists and publishing
companies during the 1960's. How should a query be framed to search for connections
between the Agency and journalists or publishing companies?
10. Did the Agency have any relationship, projects, or contacts with publishing houses
during the time of the assassination and in the aftermath of the Warren Commission?
How would a search be formulated to determine whether or not the Agency had a
relationship with any of the same publishing houses that were also publishing books
about the assassination?
11. How would a query be framed to search for files on any office or person dealing
with organized crime and Cuba? How should a request be formulated to institute a
reasonable search on this topic?
12. Is there a comprehensive record or list detailing the identities of individuals on the
Interagency Source Register? How are these records organized? How can a search
query be framed to ascertain whether or not a particular individual appears in the
Register.
13. How could a search query be framed to ascertain whether or not a particular
individual was given access to classified information by DCD (then OO)? What kind of
files are assembled in the process of clearing non-Agency contacts/sources for access to
classified information?
14. ARRB's Request for Additional Information and Record No. CIA-13, dated
November 1, 1996, contained the following questions:
A.
B.
What forms of backchannel communications were there between the
Mexico City Station (including the COS), JMWAVE, or Headquarters
during 1963? By "backchannel" we mean, inter alia, any administrative,
senior staff, or restricted access communications, or any written or
electronic communications other than regular cables or dispatches (of the
type included in the JFK Collection).
Were there, in fact, any backchannel communications between the Mexico
City Station (including the COS), JMWAVE, or Headquarters during the
time periods 27 Sept- 16 Oct 1963 and 22 Nov 30 Nov 1963?

Questions for Follow-up DO Records Briefing
April 1, 1997
P.4
1. At what point did the DDP begin to keep records of destroyed records? For
example, in a Cold Warrior footnote, Tom Mangold reports that as any of Angleton's
files were destroyed, "a complete record was carefully maintained about what had been
done. (George) Kalaris signed off on every file and the DCI's office was notified."
(p. 143) Where are these records?
2. Could an archival search be run on specific topics for retired records at the CIA's
Record's Center? Perhaps an ARRB staffer could be present during the search to review
the abstracts and to suggest other fields or topics to be searched?
3. Could a crypt search for records containing relevant crypts be run through
cryptographic reference? How would queries need to be framed and stated?
4. Why is it so difficult to develop a list for all personnel (official, contract,
administrative, or TDY) assigned to the post referenced in RIF 104-10065-10199 from
1959-1964?
5. We have been working to identify all technical and surveillance operations in and on
the Cuban and Soviet consulates and embassies in Mexico City between September 1
and December 1, 1963. How can we frame a search query to determine if we have a
comprehensive and complete list of all operations at that time?
6. How can a search query be framed to document all electronic take produced by the
Mexico City Station in the immediate wake of the assassination (the first month) and
during the period of Oswald's visit? How can we verify that what exists in the
Sequestered Collection represents all records of the technical production that was
available at the time of the assassination? If additional records or original production
still exists, where would it be stored or filed? What searches could be conducted to
retrieve any additional records? If such electronic take has been destroyed, do records
exist of the destruction?
7. Could you describe the process by which operational funds are proposed, approved,
received, and distributed (circa 1963). What funding and disbursement records exist?
How are they organized? How should a request be formulated to institute a reasonable
search of these records?

24. The DO telephone directories list an Operational Services/Defector Staff beginning
in October 1959? What was the Defector Staff? Did it have an operational component?
25. In the period 1959-1964, were DO officers, selected to serve overseas under State
(Department cover, legally considered to be "members of the Foreign Service, appointed)
by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate?"

OVERFLYING RUSSIA
158
The next thing we tried was something called a Salisbury
screen, a metallic grid applied to the airplane's undercarriage
in the hope of deflecting incoming radar beams, but it worked
only at some frequencies and altitudes and not at others.
Kelly thought it was more practical to try special iron fer
rite paints that would absorb a radar ping rather tha
bounce it back to the sender. The paints were moderately ef-
fective but inhibited heat dissipation through the airframe's
outer skin and we experienced overheating engine problems.
But the paint lowered the radar cross section by one order of
magnitude, so we decided to give it a try. We called these
specially painted airplanes "dirty birds" and shipped the first
one out for flight testing in April 1957. Our test pilot, Bob
Sieker, took the U-2 up to over. seventy thousand feet and
suddenly radioed that he was experiencing rapid airframe
heat buildup. Moments later his engine blew out and the face-
plate blew off Bob's oxygen mask as his pressure suit in-
stantly inflated. The U-2 dove straight down and crashed. It
took us three days to locate the wreckage and Bob's body. An
autopsy revealed that above seventy thousand feet he had
suffered acute hypoxia and lost consciousness in only ten
seconds. The culprit that killed him was a defective faceplate
clasp that cost fifty cents.
The CIA was so desperate to buy time for these Soviet over-
flights that Bissell got Kelly to sequester four of our test flight
engineers and have them write a bogus flight manual for a U-2
twice as heavy as ours and with a maximum altitude of only
fifty thousand feet that carried only scientific weather gear in
its bay. The manual included phony instrument panel photos
with altered markings for speed, altitude, and load factor
limits. Four copies were produced and then artificially aged
with grease, coffee stains, and cigarette burns. How or if the
agency got them into Soviet hands only Mr. B knew, and he
never told.
