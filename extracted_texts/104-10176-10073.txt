RELEVANCE OR NON-RELEVANCE TO OSWALD & JFK ASSASSINATION:

REASON OR ASSUMED REASON FOR INCLUSION IN THIS COLLECTION:
In the HSCA testimony of Silvia Duran she indicated that she
knew him and he was the Cultural Attache at the Cuban
Consulate when she was there. This info was not in the 201
file.
SUMMARY OF INFORMATION WITHIN FILE:
LITAMIL-9 was recruited by the Mexico City Station in late
62 while he was assigned to the Cuban Embassy as Cultural
Attache. He provided the Station intelligence while he was
in this assignment. He was deactivated in March 1965 when
he returned to Cuba and was seen only occasionally after
that. His contract was terminated in 1970 because of his
lack of access. Only one relevant document was found which
indicated that Proenza, who worked at the Cuban Embassy,
believed that the strong objection to the Mexican Government
by the Cuban Embassy over the Duran's detention was a
diplomatic error. This document was processed for release.

1. The Provisional Operational Approval for LITAMIL-9
(C-101331) is due to expire 8 January 1965.
2. In discussions with the field case officer for this
operation, WH/1/Mexico has found that there is no way to
determine when, or whether, LITAMIL-9 will again leave Cuba.
For reasons of personal security, LITAMIL-9 has not been

and reports from occasional Cuban official travelers transiting
Mexico indicate that LITAKIL-9 is well and is employed by the
National Cultural Council.
3. LITAMIL-9 is now an inactive agent. The Station
has recently proposed that his salary cease accumulating

Cuba, he will be contacted and a full assessment of his

Dear Luis, how are you? Before leaving I called you to verify

all are very happy, saying that the vacation in Bulgaria is
pleasant and inexpensive at the same time, less expensive
than in Nice or Italy. Thus Bulgaria is developing interna-

a lot of money.
Eut what be ing things I'm writing! I'm sure that you

One more interesting thing about the tourist service
here. There are some typical national restaurants open where
Bulgarian fantasy is represented. For example, one repre-
sents a place where there are sheep (I don't know what it is
in Spanish). It's a large
It's a large patio divided into small patios,
everything like in a town. There is a stone hearth in the
floor,
something in Dig bushct. There is
stone stove, also with a fire inside. There are some farm
buildings, everything true to life. To make the picture
complete, in one of the small ratios there is a burro, in
another, some sheep, and they all have a terrible odor!
But everybody is happy and taking pictures, etc. The waiters
are dressed in national costumes and the national orchestra
plays too. Can you imagine it, Luis? It's very nice! The
other restaurant, for example, represents the interior of
(I don't know in Spanish, in French the mill). There is
the stone for grinding, there are filled sacks where you sit,
etc., etc. The food is served in national dishes ... but
let's not talk about food there is everything in abundance.
After the first admirations ("what delicious cherries!"
what big peaches!", etc.), I discovered a great danger for
me in all this. If, for example, Anguel gains 2

Dear Luis, how are you? Before leaving I called you to verify
your address and, of course, to say "the last goodbye" (for
three months!), but you weren't there. Surely you had your
mind on the countryside after the hurricane. If you did,
I wish that you could climb like during the fifteen days of
Girón, that would suit you very well.
We have been in Bulgaria for three days now: one day in Sofia
and two in Varna in the guest house of the Bulgarian MINREX.
The trip went fine, but it was very fatiguing; we couldn't

Good morning, Luis! How are you? We are well. We frequently
think of Havana and of our friends (I of a "bored" man too).
After the Black Sea we spent one week in Sofia, and the fol-
lowing week we relaxed at the Radio Sofia tourist house (be-
fore leaving for Cuba I worked for Radio Sofia), located on
the Vitusha, near Sofia. The Bulgarians call this mountain
"lungs of the capital". It's a very lovely place. Living in

We are now in Sofia, preparing to continue our tour through

Mus-ala (2925 meters). It isn't difficult it's not very
high. What a good country Bulgaria is, but in my opinion she
lacks contemplative men. Yes, yes, that's true. They are
all too practical.

PERUMEN/LIRAVINE/LITAMIL-9/Operational Progress Report
ACTION REGUIRED - REFERENCES
Reference; HMMA 26552, 8 July 1965
MICRORUM
1. LITAMIL-9 seems to be trapped inside PBR MEN. On 18 August the
Case Officer met with LITAMIL-17 (1-9's brother) to review two letters received
from L-9. One of these, dated 15 July and mailed at Gander, Newfoundland
(presumably by an airline crew member), used the term "de lo mas bien." This
is an indicator meaning "I expect to leave within a year. In another (undated)
letter L-9 reports that he has been promoted to "Secretario de Segunda"
2. L-9 asked for a large quantity of art supplies and mentioned that he
1106 ming oince it uses
painting since he was not yet quee walk to Work, One quality
of material requested indicates that he expects to remain inside for some time.
3. The C/O asked L-17 to phone L-9, ostensibly to request further detail
on how to ship the art supplies. In the course of the conversation L-17 was to
ask L-9 how long he expected to remain in PBRUMEN. L-17 reported on 28 August
that he had spoken with L-9. L-9 said he did not expect to leave for "a long
time."
4.
With the Lecent defections of AMMASP-1 and a PBRUMEN Ambassador in
Europe it may be difficult for L-9 w obtain a foreign post. It is not likely
that he could seriously be considered politically reliable by the PERUMEN
Government. With the return of his mother and sister from Spain he no longer
has an excuse to request permission to visit Madrid. The only bright spot
on the horizon is his sister-in-law's close relationship to AMTHUG. L-17 feels
that it is to her advantage to have L-3 abroad so L-9 can send her consumer goods
which are unobtainable in PBRUMEN.
5. At present the Station has no reason to believe L-9 will be able to
leave PBRUMEN any time soon.

tional tourism intensively and, of course, is bringing in
a lot of money.
But what boring things I'm writing! I'm sure that you
are already sleepy. Not by any means de I want you to think
that these are exercises in Spanish so as not to forget it.
I simply want to relate some of my impressions and observa-
tions, and you, a man so good and fine, can understand, can't
you?
One more interesting thing about the tourist service
here. There are some tyrical national restaurants open where
Bulgarian fantasy is represented. For example, one repre-
sents a place where there are sheen (I don't know what it is
in Spanish). It's a large ratio divided into small patios,
everything like in a town. There is a stone hearth in the
floor, where something boiis in a sig basket. There is a
stone stove, also with a fire inside. There are sone farm
buildings, everything true to life. To make the picture
complete, in one of the small ratios there is a burro, in
another, some sheep, and ... they all have a terrible odor!
But everybody is happy and taking pictures, etc. The waiters
are dressed in national costumes and the national orchestra
plays too. Can you imagine it, Luis? It's very nice! The
other restaurant, for example, represents the interior of
(I don't know in Spanish, in French the mill). There is
the stone for grinding, there are filled sacks where you sit,
etc., etc. The food is served in national dishes
but
--
...
let's not talk about food there is everything in abundance.
After the first admirations ("what delicious cherries!",
what big peaches!", etc.), I discovered a great danger for
me in all this. If, for example, Anguel gains 2
it's no problem but for me it's problem #1!

I'll close now. Before closing I'll tell you a joke
(appropriate!). A family went to bed one night. Suddenly
a loud noise was heard the cat knocked something over in
the kitchen. Eut the frightened woman cried: "Run, my hus-
band is coming!" and her husband, frightened also, jumped
out of the window in his pajamas.
Until later, Luis. I give you my hand. The letter
between us, is that all right?

1. On 6 May 1965 the brother of LITAMIL-9 (Subject of reference B),
contacted the case officer. A meeting was held in Mexico City on the
night of 7 May. 19's brother turned over a postcard dated 25 March and
a letter dated 8 April, both from I-9. These had been mailed in Mexico
City on 20 April, presumably by a PERUMEN Airline pilot.
2. The card and letter revealed that L-9 is still on vacation and
unmolested by PERUMEN Security forces. His mother and unmarried sister
returned to PERUMEN from Madrid on 22 March and will presumably remain
in PERUMEN. 1-9 does not know when he will be leaving PERUMEN or where
he will be stationed but the tone of his letter conveys the impression
that be will be posted abroad.
3. In the letter L-9 again used a code phrase indicating that
the regime appears to be leaning away from the Communist bloc.
4. A FRQ, Part II, will be forwarded soon on I-9's brother.

As for the speculation that LITAMIL-3 suspects that Rabassy phases are
tapped, he has indicated his belief that this is the case ever since he was
taken over by the present C/O. In fact, he is prone to say I called
80 -and-so on sub-and-chetter, using the phone instead of the inter-
cấm sử you could hear it: In cases wherein he has spoken this way, he has
been told that chances are we will never hear about the matter discussed
unless he reports on it specifically in his meetings with his C/o.

4. This all, of course, again raises the practical diffi-
culties encountered in trying to provide meaningful support to
the Station when proper operational reporting is consistently
neglected as in the case in the LITAMIL-9 op. Consistency has
virtue only when in the right direction. While we are on it.
please note that Cubau op dispatches should be addressed to

Operational Approval for LITAMIL-9
1. An Operational Approval is requested for LITAMIL-9,
who has recently returned () Cuba, and has accepted an FI
mission from Mexico Station. The Station has expressed its
reluctance to interview a Mexican officer who alleged in
1959 that LITAMIL-9 was a Communist, since this course of
action would unnecessarily draw attention of this officer
to our interest in LITAMIL-9. WH/1 has concurred in this
decision, and considers that this unevaluated derogatory
information on LITAMIL-9 is far outweighed by his perfor-
**
2. Realizing the risk involved in working with any
Cuban national, WH/1 feels that LITAMIL-9's excellent record
of cooperation, plus his acceptance of the idea of continued
cooperation in a denied area favor consideration of n
Operational Approval. Additionally, we have had audio
coverage through the telephone in LITAMIL-9's office for
the past two years or more, and during this time the Station
has used the installation for spot checking his information,
and is satisfied that there are no reasons to question his
veracity and security or suspect that he is under control
of the Cuban service. ·
3. Attached for your review are several contact
reports of LITAMIL-9, as requested by Mr. Lally. Their
prompt return will be appreciated. This office will be
pleased to cooperate in any further review of this case
which will facilitate the QA.

1. We are pleased that Barker has prevailed upon LITANIL-9
to return to Cuba and even more important, of course, to agree to
be alert to service the cause and again, still better, to agree
to the use of a communications system.
known reluctance for this sort of thing we understand that Barker
Considering LITAMIL-9's
had to be quite convincing with his arguments and also very
possibly had to resort to some arm-twisting.
2. Nevertheless, lacking operational progress reports and
therefore not knowing the full background of Barker's procedures,
we did note that in paragraph 3.ii, page 4, of the C/R attached
to reference, the Station tipped off LITAMIL-9 that he would

came from the LIENVOY of LIFEAT take, and, to complete the record
here, would appreciate a note as to the origin of the information
that LITAWMIL-9 was to be transferred. We further note from
paragraph 3 of the Memorandum for the Record dated 11 March, also
attached to reference, that, in essence,
in essence, a further acknowledgement
was made to LITAMIL-9 that the Station has the capability to
intercept Cuban Embassy telephone conversations.
3. While there may be a simple explanation for this report
we are constrained to make known our concern that such appareat
revelations, however well-intentioned, obviously could cause
unpleasant repercussions and are regarded under normal circumstances
as basically unsound violations of operational compartmentation
and procedure.

of LITAMIL-9 Ca's would be forwarded to WH/EA,

3. It is realized that an operational progress report and a contact
report are two different items; however, in view of the detailed nature of
the LITAXIL-9 CR's the Station has felt that their submission has satisfied
the requirements of operational reporting. The criticism of reference is
all the more puzzling since such visitors to the Saction as Chester D.
Dainold, Chief, WHD; Mortán A. Woolley, erstwhile Chief of Operations, HD;
and Thomas W. Land, present México Branch Chief, have all expressed their
approval of the detailed operational reporting on this operation during
visits they have made to the Station at which time the reports in question
have been brought to their attention
4. When LITANII-9 next exits PERIMEN, the Station will begin to
epare formal operational progress reports on the operatim.
5. As for the questions raised in paragraph 2 of reference regarding
operatimal security, advance information on LITAMIL-9's recall came from
LIENVOY but he was not informed of the imminence of his transfer until it
was reported routinely by LITAMIL-7 and was generally known by his colles-
ques. is for the implication that LITAKII-9 was informed of the Station's
capability to intercept Embassy telephone conversations, a careful re-
reading of the Memorandum under critique will show that no such ackno
ledgement was made. LITANIL) was informed that "we have a good chance
of being told about such a conversation by one of our friends," 1.e. that
word will probably get around in Embassy circles that LITAFIL-9 is abo
to travel to such-and- such a point.

Appraisal of Content: 2.
European businessmen (F).
Since mid-February 1963 Mexican immigration authorities have
placed stamps in the passports of travellers to and from Cuba
which read "Arrived from Cuba" and "Left for Cuba". The
stamps are placed on the page with the picture.
All requests for Mexican tourist visas in Cuba must be approved
in Mexico before they are issued in Habana.
Field Comments
1.
Cuban visas are often issued on a separate piece of paper
and not stamped in the passport, so that the passport
would not show that the bearer had travelled to Cuba.
2. This regulation was first noticed in February 1963.
Documentation for travel from Mexico to Cuba does not differ
from that needed for travel to other Latin American countries.
The traveller must have a passport or other travel document,
with a valid visa. Mexican citizens within the specified
age group must also carry a cartilla militar.
Mexican security services do not screen applications for travel
to Cuba. Although the Mexican Government has taken no action
to prevent travel to Cuba, it has discouraged government
employees from accepting invitations to Cuban-sponsored
activities. It also appears to want to avoid recognition of
Cuban Government activities by not sending government-sponsored
delegations. These steps, plus the bothersome baggage searches,
photographs, and questioning by Mexican immigration authorities
have probably curtailed travel to Cuba.

A neutralist diplomat (C) in Mexico City, from
Sori Coulibaly.
Appraisal of Content:
2.
On 18 February 1963 Sori Coulibaly, the Ambassador of the
Republic of Mali to the United Nations and to Cuba,
Mamadou Traore, Deputy Permanent Representative of the Mali
1 and
Mission to the United Nations, arrived in Mexico from Habana,
Cuba. Coulibaly told members of the Cuban Embassy in
Mexico City that he had spoken with Raul Roa, Cuban Foreign
Minister, who asked Coulibaly to take steps to have the
Government of Mali send a resident Ambassador to Cuba.
Coulibaly said that the Cubans had put pressure on him to
open an office in Habana and that they had in fact given him
a building for this purpose. However, Coulibaly said that
he did not see how Mali could afford to open an office in
Habana, in view of the fact that he had hardly enough money
to operate the Mali Mission to the United Nations.2
Coulibaly and Traore left Mexico City on 20 February for
New York. Coulibaly carried Mali diplomatic passport No. 23;
Traore carried diplomatic passport No. 42.

Headquarters Comment. Coulibaly presented his credentials
In Cuba on 13 February 1963.
Source Comment. Coulibaly confided that he had requested
50 million Mali francs (about $203,000.00) as an annual
budget for the operation of the Mali Mission to the
United Nations; that he had been allotted only one-tenth
of that amount for the first quarter of 1963; and that
he had not received even that.

REPUBLICA DE CUBA
CONSEJO NACIONAL DE CULTURA
DIRECCION DE RELACIONES INTERNACIONALES
Eexcelentfsino Embajador de los E.U. Mexicanos, Sres. Miembros
del Cuerpo Diplomático
Sras y Sres.
Es para mi un honor quo en ocasión como esta, represente al Con-
sejo Nacional de Cultura en que se inaugura la exposición "Caleidoscopio
Fotográfico" del artista mexicano Nacho López.
Creo sinceramente, que el gran artista Nacho López, no necesita
presentación, su arte en muy conocido en Cuba a través de revistas interna-
cionales v periódicos que
uncia reproduce ou trabajo artisitico;
además no es la primera vez que tengamos el gusto de tenerlo entre nosotros
así como a otors tantos mexicanos ilustres que nos ham visitado desde el
triunfo de la Revolución.
Aquí en esta sala encontraremos un exponente gráfico de lo que
tan acertadamente nos dice en su introspectiva el artista que nos ocupa.
"El placer-on ef más no la diversión
-
que despierten ideas y emociones en el espectador, pretendo hacerlo conscien-
de producir imágenes
tedde que el mundo no non cuatro paredes, trabajo y familia; sino que hay
otras formas bellas y hor ibles, otros rostros que tambien viven, respiran
y mueren, en busca de las mismas necesidades eternas: trabajo, vestido, comi-
da y dignidad.
La exposición que nos disponemos a admirar estrecha aún más los
lazos que nos une con el gran país hermano México, y no quisiera dejar de
destacar en esta oportunidad, la satisfacción que nos produce cooperar con
la Embajada de Néxico que ha hecho posible la exposición que se ofrece con-
juntamante con la Sociedad Cubano-Mexicana de Relaciones Culturales y el
Consejo Nacional de Cultura (Delegación Provincial)
Muchas gracias,
Luis Alberú,
Responsable de Protocolo.

LITAKIL-9, who had previously reported that he
thought Subject might be willing to cooperate with
LAMARP if properly approached, refused to make any
effort to contact him. The Station suggested that
the cooperation of Subject's ex-wife, now residing
in the JXWAVE area, be enlisted and that she visit
him in Canada with their child.

American writers Congress in Mexico and it's Cuban delegation.

2. In addition to the meetings mentioned in the attached
memorandum, the Case Officer, Raymond A. FRADYER, also met
L-9 on 28 March. He knew from LIENVOY that Ambassador Joaquin
HERNANDEZ Armas was having a reception that night at the Cuban
Embassy in honor of Alejo CARPENTIER Belmont. He also knew that
CARPENTIER had agreed to meet L-9 earlier that day. FRADYER
therefore assumed that L-9 had probably been invited to the Embassy
affair. FRADYER had spent some time at his last meeting with L-9
briefing the latter on elicitation techniques and how he felt L-9
would safely bring up the subjects of the Vietnam war and French-
Cuban relations, two topics on which CARPENTIER could provide
interesting information. FRADYER was disappointed when L-9 told
him that he had left his house that morning at 7A.M. and had been
at his brother's plant in Toluca the entire day. L-9 added that
he would have to spend the next day in Toluca and thus would be
unable to talk to CARPENTIER before the latter left.

Throughout the south of November be debated the question of whether
or not be should return to Cuba. In the first week of December 1966,
he decided to remain in Mexico.
2. Since it was believed that LEWMIL-9 would hire little
cess to LIKE or to parsons of interest in lizzies, he vas teminated
and the balance of his escrow account was paid to him on 9 December
1966. However, it has since become apparent that from time to tim
it would be vainable to KK ACT to contact LITAMIL-9 for information
on PRIMEX personalities. En is acquainted with a large number of
persons who themselves are of interest to WFACT or who could supply
information on third persons on whom information is needed.
3. Therefore, previsional operational approval and subsequent
operational exproval for such occasional contact with MWAHL-9 is
requested. It is not planned to pay him a salary or formalize an
agent relationship. LXII-9 would only be contacted when specifis
needs for information arise and the possibility exists that he has
or could obtain the information.

3. FRADYER is very much aware of Headquarters interest in
L-9. Although he plans to meet L-9 regularly, he doubts (as
previously mentioned to Clyde K. SHRYOCK when the latter recently
visited Mexico) that L-9 will live up to Headquarters expectations.
As mentioned by yg bimcalf:
A. He is acting as the general manager of the coffee
grounds to edible plant in Toluca in which he and his
* brother own shares. Not only
Not only is this a new firm, but the
raw material and process used to make the oil are somewhat
of a novelty. The plant is deeply in the red (L-9 has yet
-
-
-
to receive a salary and commutes to Toluca by bus) and requires
- close and time consuming attention. With the best of will,
it is and will be difficult for L-9 to get away whenever he
is needed by this Station.
1
B. As pointed out by L-9 himself, L-9 has now been in
Mexico for some six months and has succeeded in obtaining
from Gobernacion his reinstatement as a resident alien. It
must be increasingly evident to the Cubans (despite L-9's
request for extended leave from his job in Cuba) that the
latter will probably not go back to Cuba. In other words,
- the Cubans probably view him more and more as an exile.
c. Because he spends most of his time away from Mexico
City and because his Cuban friends are becoming more reserved
with him, L-9 has less and less contacts with visiting Cubans.
In fact, only one, the Subject of Mexico City 0783, has
phoned him when visiting Mexico since L-9's return to this
country. L-9, who senses that he is now an exile in the
eyes of many of his friends in Cuba, is even reluctant to
write to them. He feels, for example, that little would be
accomplished by writing to Esebio #AZCUE Lopez, as the latter
would probably not leave Cuba because of his young wife and
child even though he is fed-up with the Castro regime. On
the contrary, L-9 feels that he might not be coing AZCUE
any favor by writing to him as the latter who is not known
for being an enthusiastic supporter of the regime may be
under some observation from the Cuban authorities.
4.
Information obtained by L-9 from CARPENTIER, Lizandro
* OTERO and Nicolas *GUILLEN indicates
A. Together with information from other sources that
the Cubans probably prearranged to take over the Congress of
Latin American Writers with the help of the other Communists
and use it for political purposes.
B. That Cintio VITIER is obviously not trusted by the
Castro regime and may be in trouble.
c. That the Cubans are making a major effort, in line
with their pro-French policy to show themselves in Paris
under the best light possible.
D. That CARPENTIER obviously enjoys the confidence of
the regime. His trip to Hanoi had certainly nothing to do
with cultural affairs. It is regretted that L-9 did not
elicit further information from CARPENTIER on his visit to
North Vietnam.

SUBJECT:
LITAMIL-9 and the Latin American Writer's Congress
in Mexico
-
-
1. The undersigned reviewed the list of delegates
attending the Latin American Writer's Congress with L-9
on 19 March 1967. The latter indicated he knew all the
members of the Cuban delegation Alein CADDENTIED Dalmane
-
Roberto FERNANDEZ Retamar, Lizandro OTERO, Nicolas GUILLEN
and Pablo NEREDA, a Chilean writer whom he first met some
_ 25 years ago and saw again about 1962. L-9 stressed he
did not know the Cuban delegates to the point of calling
_ anyone of them a personal friend as his dealings with them
had been confined to professional contacts when he worked
-
for the National Cultural Council.
-
He had never been in-
Ivited to their homes or invited them to his. The delegate
he felt most at ease with was Alejo CARPENTIER with whom he
felt he had more in common than with the others. CARPENTIER
who has a French father and white Russian mother lived many
years in France and spent some time in South America. L-9
considered him to be an intellectual of definite "bourgeois"
background and tastes. Not only is CARPENTIER well known

everything in Cuba (political and economic situation, sugar
harvest, etc) was fine. He informed L-9 that he did not
have the opportunity to see L-9's sister-in-law and that
_ he had given a letter, which L-9 had asked him to deliver to
her for passage to the National Cultural Council, to Marta
GONZALEZ of the International Relations Bureau of the
Council. L-9, in this letter, asked that his three month
leave from the Cultural Council be greatly extended. The
Ambassador said he ignored what reaction the Cultural
people had to his letter. He explained that the Cultural
Council is now part of a Bureau headed by Lisandro OTERO.

He was replaced as the head of the
council by fnu MUZIO, ex rector of the University of
Oriente. The Ambassador insisted that, in spite of this,
the National Cultural Council still kept some degree of
autonomy. He was rather evasive when L-9 mentioned
his desire to call on the Cuban delegates to the Writer's
Congress. He said that he did not think that a party
would be held at the Embassy for the delegates and did not
offer to put L-9 in contact with the people he wanted to

mentioned in connection with the Nobel Prize for literature)
and his journalistic writing (L-9 still remembered some of
the articles regularly written by him in Paris for the
"El Mundo" daily in the pre Castro era), but he is also
an established music critic and a connaisseur of modern
painting, all in all a talented and most impressive man
now in his sixties.
2. L-9 had on many occasions offered to help WOFACT
in any way possible. The undersigned pointed out that he
now had a unique opportunity to do this with the Writer's
Congress. WOFACT was interested in assessing the Cuban
representatives at this Congress to determine their
possible vulnerability to recruitment.
It was also in-
terested in hearing from the Cuban delegates what they
thought of the Congress and it's accomplishments since it
was apparent that the great majority of it's members were
Communist sympathizers and would probably use the Congress
for political purposes. Any information on the situation
in Cuba and on Cuban Government organizations, particularly
on the incorporation of the National Cultural Council into
the Ministry of Education would be appreciated. it would
also be interesting to know why Cintio VITIER who was
scheduled to come to the Congress did not show up. L-9
said he was willing to help but was extremely busy with
his brother's edible oil business in Toluca. It would be
2
:

to Mexico City (he did not say why) ahead of the other
Cuban delegates who were returning by road later that day.
GUILLEN told L-9 that he would be in the same neighborhood
early next day and would be glad to have coffee with him if
L-9 could meet him then. Anyway, he added, he would be
staying in Mexico for another two weeks at the request of
the Ambassador. They could see each other again later on
before he left. As they were about to cross a busy street
shortly before parting, L-9 took GUILLEN by the arm in a
Friendly yeaɩuic.
The latter pulled away and 1-0 had the
_ feeling that GUILLEN did not want to let L-9 be friendly

with him.
5. The next meeting with L-9 was held on 24 March.
L-Q said that he had not been able to call on the Cubans
at the Del Prado until earlier that day. He had run into
Licandro OTERO while in the lobby. The latter told him he
was about to leave. When L-9 said "already?" OTERO pointed
out that he had been in Mexico for two weeks already.
L-9 repeated the derogatory remarks made about the Congress
by GUILLEN. OTERO said that, on the contrary, this had
been a successful meeting. A letter of protest had been
sent to President Johnson and the Congress had taken a
firm position against the "Imperialists." After relating
the above, L-9 recalled that a rumor circulated in Havana,
shortly before his departure from Cuba, to the effect that
6

Sifficult for him to find time to talk with the Cuban
delegates, he felt ; in addition, that it would be difficult
for him to simply walk in on the delegates if he could not
be invited, officially, to the Congress or to a social
affair connected with it. Finally, L-9 pointed out that
he had now been in Mexico for nearly six months, that
"everyone" knew that he had no intention of returning to
Cuba and that, for these reasons, the Cuban delegates to
the Congress might not be omalous to tath to him. After
a long "pep" talk by the undersigned and some discussion
it was decided that L-9 would call the next morning on
Ambassador Joaquin HERNANDEZ Armas who had just returned
from Cuba. L-9 would pay his respects and find out if the
Embassy planned some social function at which he could
openly meet the Cuban delegates (he felt he might wrangle
an invitation to such an affair either directly from the
Ambassador or from Heberto JORRIN, the ex-Embassy portero
whom he has known for years). It was further decided that
L-9 would concentrate on CARPENTIER with whom he felt he
- had the best rapport and who was in his view the delegate
with the most "bourgeois" background.
3. At a meeting held on 21 March L-9 related that he
had seen Ambassador HERNANDEZ earlier that morning (the
delegates to the writer's Congress which had been held for
the last few days in Guadalajara were scheduled to return
the next day). He had found the Ambassador nervous and pre-
Moccupied. The latter told him almost mechanically that

posed to visit the Embassy the next day and talk to JORR IN
about the Congress. The Latter might be able to place him
in contact with the Cuban visitors.
4. The undersigned met L-9 again on 22 March. L-9
stated that he had visited the Cuban Embassy early that
day but had to wait for INDD IN 11s out for about 20
The latter was 1 busy after his return that
minutes.
L-9 had only a few minutes of conversation with him.
JORRIN confirmed that the Embassy would not have a party
for the Congress delegates "because of the Semana Santa,
and said he did not know exactly when the delegates would
drop in the Embassy following their return from Guadalajara.
Upon leaving JORRIN, L-9 went to the Del Prado where he was
told that the Congress delegates would only return to Mexico
late that day. A few blocks from the hotel 1-9 ran into
Nicolas GUILLEN who greeted him by saying "here is L-9 in
his ambiente Mexicano." The two men walked
The two men walked together back
to the Del Prado. GUILLEN turned down L-9's invitation for
a cup of coffee saying he had to visit someone. He did
mention that the Congress, as far as he was concerned, was
"una basura" and told L-9 that he had flown from Guadalajara
S

on an official mission.
CARPENTIER gave no details
other than to say that that horrible war was probably
going to last, and that U.S. planes had flown right over
his head Juring his stay. L-9 did not press him for more
information but gathered that CARPENTIER remained in
North Vietnam two or three weeks.
CARPENTIER
7. L-9 asked why VITIER had not attended the Congress.
CARPENTIER replied that VITIER was "in a special situation
in Cuba" as he was not in accord with the revolution.
He had been given the opportunity to go to Spain for the
Cuban Government but had refused to go. VITIER undoubtedly
knew, from the background of the delegates, that the writer's
Congress in Mexico would be a leftist affair.
guessed that he probably declined to come because of this.
Talking about himself, CARPENTIER' said (without further
details) that he would be going to Moscow in May. He
announced that a film based on his novel "Los Pasos Perdidos"
would be made this year, probably half in France and haif
in Cuba (negotiations with the French are still going on).
Finally, he mentioned that he was trying to convince the
Cuban Government to create a centralized publishing depart
ment and that as Director of the Cuban National printing
office, before leaving Cuba, he had succeeded in getting
some 70 million books printed. He mentioned, incidentally,

Marcia LEISECA, OTERO's wife (a woman of about 34 who
worked at the Casa de las Americas) was about to divorce
OTERO to marry Osmani CIENFUEGOS. L-9 added that Marcia
had relatives in Mexico whom she visited in 1962 and 1965.
After leaving OTERO, L-9 phoned CARPENTIER and was told
by the latter to meet him the next day.
_ 6. L-9 and CARPENTIER met for breakfast on 24 March.
When L-9 asked him for news about the National Cultural
Council, CARPENTIER said that L-9 knew certainly more about
that then he did as he had been in France since last November.
CARPENTIER claimed that he had been called in by DORTICOS
last October and told that Caudilio CASTILLANOS, the current
Cuban Ambassador in Paris had requested his nomination to
the Paris Embassy as Minister Concellor. CARPENTIER said
he tried to get out of this two year assignment which he
found too long, but was told by DORTICOS that there was no
way out of it.
The Cuban Government, said DORTICOS, was
out to make it's representation in Paris "an absolutely
first class Embassy". DORTICOS added that CARPENTIER would
not be so busy in Paris that he would not find time to write.
Whether he found time to write CARPENTIER did not say.
What he did say was that the Ambassador, who was doing a
very good job,did an enormous amount of work and usually
worked late at night. He also mentioned that while in
Paris or shortly before arriving there he had gone to Hanoi

Memorandum for the Recond
Subject: Meeting with. LIT-ITL-9
9 November 1956
PER telecon on the morning of 8 November, the un-
dersigned met with LITAMIL-2 at 2100 at the Gutenberg/Thiers' glorieta. L-9
was taken to the home of Gene F. BRADDOCK, where the meeting was held. The meeting
lasted until 0200 on 9 NOT EA. NO SECURITY PROBLEMS NOTED.
An interesting and fantastic incident occurred on
the night of 7 Tov. L-9 said he saw the misigned walking by his apartment when
for some unknown reason he got to look out the window. The undersigned did, in
fact, walk by L-7's apar ment on the night of the 7th at about 2300. E-9 was, c2-
course, very impressed with this quirk of fate as was the undersigned.
Thnoo
in time, a city of 5 million people etc. At approximately 2245, the undersigned
called L-9 and a woman answered the phone. Nothing was said by the undersigned
and the phone was hung up. It is possible that this call, if the number was correct,
had some influence on his appearance at the window. However, L-9 rade no mention
of a woman at his place but said he had been reading and get to look out.
PERSONAL PROLES:
-
1-0 is very concerned about having lost his Mexican residence
permit. XXL According to L-9, the Mexican Govt took away his residence permit be-
cause he broke Nexican laws. I-7 travelled to Cuba several times without advising the
proper authorities during the last several years. L-9 always travelled to Cuba as a
Cuban diplomat and not as a Mexican resident therefore there was no record of his
trav 1. This was obviously against the rules and L-9 has to pay for it. L-9 went
to see Coty SCLORZNIC re this problem and she told him to get in touch with Ignacio
"Xa_cho" ^ STA Lagumas. ACCSTI took 1-9 to Gobernacion but he was able to see
the oficial Mayer, GALVEZ, Inn. They talked with another official ho gave them
little hope. ACOSTA said he would go to see CALTEZ, himself, on the following Monday
but again, he was able to get to see GALVEZ. (Lic. Carlos GALTEZ Betancourt).

1-9 went to see Amb. Joaquin HERNANDEZ Armas after AC failed to help him
and HERNANDEZ told him he would talk with Ing. Jorge TURTO, that TAMAYO was
the man who would be able to help. L-9 is pretty shock about this probl»
because he was told at Gobernacion that he would have to reapply again and there-
fore go through the same red tape as before, i.e. five years, restrict-
od travel etc. L-9, of course, has new hope with his contact with us but XXXI
XIX be was told that only as a last resort would the US. get involved ondar
to protect the operation.
L-9 again went into the business of his brother's reiet and
that of his iron in the IS
th
Mexico as the company's administrator. L-9 stated as he has done in the past that
he is being pulled in both directions, i.e. toward Mexico by his brother etc and
E toward Cuba by the U.S. Govt. He did not make it clear which of the two
pressures he expects to succurb to. The undersigned did not push the issue at this
Resting hoping to get into this matter at a later meeting.
L-9, just before he got out of the car, mentioned that he was
in need of money and wanted to get spare parts etc to set back to Cuba with Orlando
SHARES, who is scheduled to leave for Habara on Monday. The undersigned said he
would get L-9 some money for the next meeting.
1-9 was in good spirits, very proud of his files and anxious to
to please. Hε described himself during the last year or so in Cuba as "un soldado
en su puesto" ready to serv when the time cane. He was pleasdi, of course, to have
contact again with CDT XE and indicated he was a little shook up because his brother
was all over the place" and therefore not a good content point. He was concerned
about how hewas going to make contact.
L-9's post with the Consejo is: Jefe de Protocolo and Liaison
officer with the Foreign embassies in Habana.

Memorandan for the Record
SUBJECT: Fidel CASTRO Ruz
22 November 1956
:
re Fidel CASTRO Ruz:
On 9-10 November 1966, LITAMIL-9 reported the fellowing
a) LITAMIL-9 was not aware of any problem that CASTRO might have had
during the period May-June 1966, when he failed to appear publicly.
L-9 believes that he wo:ld have heard about any sericus problem
through "Conchita" FERMONEZ had there been one.
said that we should not pay much attention to reports that CASTRO
On this secre, L-9
is losing power or turning it over to the Party because, although
he remains out of the limelight for a time, he bounces back bigger
and more popular than ever. L-9 did recall that CASTRO was operated
on by Dr. RODRIGUEZ Diaz, fmu, Bor a rectal problem but he beliefes
this was in 1966.
b) CASTRO has changed his mind about voluntary labor and now feels that
those assigned to the tasks given them should get the job done without
voluntary assistance. L-3 believes that Celia SANCHEZ reflected this
policy when she recently told "Conchita" FERNANDEZ not to volunteer
her services. 6.9 believes that CASTRO has recognized his folly in
the case of voluntary labor and realizes now that this merely pro-
vokes his minions into creating problems in areas where they should
not be, i.e. lack of personnel in times when they needed in specific
job. L-9 believes Cubans are taking advantage of voluntary labor to
be missing from own assigned tasks in a form of clandestine subtle
sabotage operattion. It is this that CASTRO is also beginning to re-
alize.
c) CASTRO termination of militia courses per memo also shows a switch
in attitude of CASTRO, who may also see conterproductive results of
indoctrinating Cubans across the board. This happened about two months
d)
ago.

These two books have been found unsuitable

a few days earlier that LITAMIL-9 is well, has put on some weight,

The Station has had no recent contact with LITAMIL-17
who is LITAMIL-9's brother. It is assumed that should he hear
anything of interest concerning LITAMIL-9, be will report it
promptly to the C/O.
3. It is recalled that when LITAMIL-9 left Mexico for PERUMEN
in March 1965 he told his C/O he would, by hook or by crook, find
some way to get back to Mexico within 23 months lest he lose his
inmigrado status in Mexico. it is assumed that he is exploring
every angle to make his escape and one possibility that comes to
mind is that he might try to wangle a connection with the PERUMEN
pavilion at the 1967 Canadian International Fair in an effort to
break out. Owing to his well-known non-Communist beliefs, it would
seem that he has almost no chance to secure a diplomatic assignment.

Le ruego me excuse por mi tardanza en enviarle
esta carta de agradecimento a Ud. por el esfuerzo que
realizó, e hizo posible pudiésemos tocar para su pueblo.
Aun conservamos plenamente, un vivido y feliz
recuerdo del viaje. Las cajas de tabacos que Ud. no dió
en el aeropuerto, fueron sumanente apreciadas por mi
maestro Efren Zimbalist, quien ha sido por años un apa-
sionado del tabaco habana.'
Para el próximo verane estamos planeando regre-
sar al Japón; para una gira de conciertos, y la Sociedad
de Amistad Japón-Cuba en Tokyo, nos ha ofrecido organizar
la gira.
Me parece que si Ud, pudiese escribir una carta
de recomendación o endorsement, con las impresiones de
Vd. sobre nuestras actuaciones en Cuba, sería de gran
valor para nosotros, para que la gira en el Japón se haga
posible.
Le rogamos haga llegar a su familia, nuestros
más cálidos3 saludos y muy especialmente para Elpidio.
Bonfiamos en que ya Ud. sea un orgullose abuelo.
Estamos esperando por su carta muy pronto.
Al mismo tiempo, reciba nuestros mejores para-
bienes y sentimientos de aprecio.
Muy sinceramente suyo,

on 21 April - keer and the Brazilian Amb in Algiers
said that as far as he knew no changes had been made

MEMORANDUM FOR:

Chief, WH/3
Wayne Carley
LITAMIL/9
C-101,331
SECRET
10 July 1963
1. With reference to your memorandum dated 24 June 1963 attaching
PRQ Part II and requesting an Operational Approval for Subject's use,
your attention is directed to derogatory information forwarded by Station
Mexico to the effect that an ODEX report dated 25 August 1959 stated
that 0:1.
Maxim 2:2, bellowed to be a
munist and one of the most influential members of the Cuban Embassy
staff.
--
2. On 18 September 1962 we requested SAS, which then had Head-
quarters responsibility for this case, to request Station Mexico City to
determine the basis for Mexico G-2's allegation, to obtain any evidence
substantiating the allegation, and to conduct such investigation as was
possible to determine the truth or falseness of the allegation. It was
further agreed that SAS would determine whether the Station had direct
access to Subject and would recommend polygraphing him if it were fea-
sible. We have no indication that any of this has been accomplished ar
attempted.
3. On 20 February 1963, because of the exigencies of the situation
at that particular time, a Provisional Operational Approval was granted
only for training of Subject. The Provisional Operational Approval
specified that approval for operational use of the Subject was deferred
pending satisfactory resolution of the derogatory information, which
CI Staff did not consider to have been accomplished. The FR Part II an
Subject clearly shows that he has been used operationally for the past
year without any approval.
4.
Operational Approval for Subject's use cannot be granted until
there has been compliance with our previous request to resolve the de-
rogatory information as reported by ODIBEX from Mexican G-2.

MEMORANDUM FOR:

Wayne Carley
LITAMIL/9
C-101,331
10 July 1963
1. With reference to your memorandum dated 24 June 1963 attaching
PRQ Part II and requesting an Operational Approval for Subject's use,
your attention is directed to derogatory information forwarded by Station
Mexico to the effect that an ODEEX report dated 25 August 1959 stated
440 --
-
-
munist and one of the most influential members of the Cuban Embassy
staff.
2. On 18 September 1962 we requested SAS, which then had Head-
quarters responsibility for this case, to request Station Mexico City to
determine the basis for Mexico G-2's allegation, to obtain any evidence
substantiating the allegation, and to conduct such investigation as was
possible to determine the truth or falseness of the allegation. It was
further agreed that SAS would determine whether the Station had direct
access to Subject and would recommend polygraphing him if it were fea-
sible. We have no indication that any of this has been accomplished or
attempted.
3. On 20 February 1963, because of the exigencies of the situation
at that particular tine, a Provisional Operational Approval was granted
only for training of Subject. The Provisional Operational Approval
specified that approval for operational use of the Subject was deferred
pending satisfactory resolution of the derogatory information, which
CI Staff did not consider to have been accomplished. The FR Part II on
Subject clearly shows that he has been used operationally for the past
year without any approval.
4. Operational Approval for Subject's use cannot be granted until
there has been compliance with our previous request to resolve the de-
rogatory information as reported by ODIBEX from Mexican G-2.
