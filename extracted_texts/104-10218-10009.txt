:
1. Edward G. TICHBORN spent June 1 and 2 in the Headquarters area and
departed the morning of 3 June for an overnight stop in Dallas before his
return for Mexico City. Prior to his departure, TICHBORN was advanced $100
which will be Tad to the Station for final accounting.
2. During his stopover here, he met with representatives of the
Dominican Republic Desk as well as DYVOUR Staff and Mexico Branch personnel.
In these debriefings we touched specifically on his activities in connection
with the Dominican Republic election; his estimate of the outcome of this
olection; his plans for the future, particularly his departure from Mexico;
the termination of LIREAM; and his proposal for the continuation of his
relationship with KUBARK.
a. Dominican Republic Election:
Although TICHBORN painted a rather bleak picture of the possible
results of the election, his comments concerning the situation
pertaining at the time of his departure from the island contributed
to Headquarters understanding of developments in the days immediately
preceding the election and on the election day. The DYVOUR Staff
representative and the Dominican Republic Branch representatives
specifically commended CHRORN for the excellent work he had done
during his temporary assignment to the Dominican Republic in connection
with this election operation.
b. TICHBORN Future:
We discussed TICHBORN's personal situation and desires for the
future at some length. Although not being able to offer specific
promises of long-term employment on his terms at this time, we advised
him that the Agency would probably have recurring requirements, albeit relatively
infrequent, for a man with his talents and experience. However, the
limited requirement for such specialized activity in the DYVOUR area

would probably require a broadening of his horisons to include under-
taking activities in response to requirements from non-DYVOUR areas.
TICHBORN indicated some reservation concenrding this point as well as
stating a definite lack of interest in TDY assignments which would
require him to be away from his family for protracted periods.
0. Cover and Accesss
11
TICHBORN explained his present thinkding concerning a seminar-type political
action service for which, in his mind, there is a definite requirement and
which, incidentally, he considered himself emiuntly qualified to provide
in the DYVOUR area. This would consist primarily of the same type direct
contact with candidates which he carried out in the recent election in the
Dominican Republic. In this, he envisions a short TDY, about six to nine
months before an election, to assist in the establishment of a candidate's
machine as well as the selection and training of his pricipal assistants;
another short visit about two months before the election to assist the
candidate and his assistants in defining issues and refining strategy; and
a last short visit, about two weeks before the election, to assist in
planning last minute tactics for the final week of the campaign. To
provide cover for such a service, TICHBORN proposed that he establish a
commercial office of some sort in New York. Through this office he would
establish relations with commercial clients whom he would propose to
represent on business (cover) travels trhoughout the DYVOUR area. Failing
the actual establishment of these ties, he proposes to construct a fictional
comersial relationship with various national companies which would
ostensibly offer goods or services of interest to residents of the DYVOUR
areas. While expressing interest in both the service and the cover concept,
we asked that TICHBOPN prepare a paper on his specific proposal and forward it to
Headquarters for more detailed study. No commitment was made by Headquarters
and none was implied. In fact, a number of the problems and weaknesses of
the preposal were pointed out and a specific KUBARK disinterest in under.
writing the establishment or maintenance of the commercial cover required
for such a venture on a contiming basis was noted.
d. Termination of LIRKAM
The problems which might arise from the termination of LIFEAM were
investigated rather perfunctorily since TICHBORN, needless to say, was
more interested in discussing the results of the Dominican Republic
election and his own future with KUBARK. However, TICHBORN does not
foresee any major problem arising in the termination. According to hin,
there is no real contractual relationship with his co-editor (Identity)
which would require reimbursement; there is no office equipment or other
major physical or overhead investment which would require sale or other
disposition; in accordance with Mexican law he will be required to pay a
termination bonus to his secretary but this should not be very large; and,
to his knowledge, there are no outstanding bills or commitments of which
we are not presently aware, TICHBORN was told of the deposit of $1,500,
requested in Ref. B, which should be in his account now, and he promised
to forward drafts of two letters to be mailed from New York and Denver to
cover the deposit of these funds. Headquarters would appreciate early
receipt of the draft letters as well as some sort of schedule for a
logical and phased termination of the LIREAM subsidy.
3. Headquarters will be interested in seeing the promised outline and
any refinement of the commercial cover and election seminar concept which
TICHBORN might develop and requests that the Station follow up on his
agreement to prepare such a paper for transmittal to Headquarters. We are
still investigating the requirements in other Divisions for the type
expertise offered by TICHBORN and, following receipt of his written proposal, we
will be better able to come up with a definite decision concerning what form
the TICHBORN/KUBAFK relationship might take in the future. In the meantime,
be assured that no specific commitment for continued employment or subsidy of
relocation or resettlement costs were made during TICHBORN's TDY.

might be willing to cooperate. Should you agree, I could nop
up to New York and get up the details with him personally.
Ted Prounis, who helped in the Volman-Alba deal, is another
possibility.
2. Proposed activities:
a) Continue election-aid trips such as Dominican
Republic, Chile and San Salvador trips
Would strongly suggest, in view of my past
experiences, that we approach these missions
on broader range and in greater depth. Suggest
the following:
(1) One-week survey at least six months
before election.
(2) Campaign work-shop with candidate
78*
and his campaign staff at some hide-
away epot for period of ten (10) days.
This would take place about four or
five months before the election.
(3) First follow-up trip to check on progress
of campaign, climaxed by two-day weekend
meeting with candidate and his staff.
This would be three months before election
(4) Spend final month of campaign on the
spot, tying together loose ends and
advising on closing phase of campaign
b) Frepare a handbook for election campaigns sim-
ilar to the one written by Larry O'Brien for
Kennedy's campaign. Written in Spanish and
specifically tailored for Latin America.
c) Prepare an in-depth study of growing rolitical
unrest in Nexico, particularly analyzing the
inner workings of PRI. Several recent incidents

be about $800.
3. Secretarial help, only part-time: about $750
per year, for a total of £1,500.
4. Tape recorder and tapes for two-year period:
about $200.
5. Costs of reference books and periodicals:
about $150.
Over-all total would be $5,150
e) Costs of preparing election campaign handbook
1. Secretarial costs: about $750
2. Translators' help with special terms for the

(Fadrazo's forced resignation from PRI; the
run-ɛway riots at the National University which
compelled Chavez to resign; the increased number
of paracaidista squatters on private lands;
campesino revolts in Northern Mexico) indicate
that the famed political stability of Mexico
may be facing trouble soon. Needless to say,
such an ominous possibility should be studied
and analyzed in great depth. No Mexican political
observer would dare produce a truly candid study
for fear of political and governmental pressure,
but I'm sure I can obtain th sub-rosa counsel
and aid of Antonio Fenendez a gifted and per-
ceptive Fexican who wrote NOVIIIZACION SOCIAI.
Fenendez, who was a Lopez Mateos speech writer,
is now director of public relations for the
Instituto Nacional de Seguro Social and also
head of the Consejo Nacional de Publicidad.
This long-range project would probably
require about two years, taking into account
my aforementioned political trips.
d) Undertake such other quasi-political missions
as may be required: possible back-up trip to
Santo Domingo; surveys of student unrest in
Spain, Panama, Feru and elsewhere; mid-term
surveys of political situations in Chile, Guate-
mala, Venezuela, etc.
3. Budget Considerations:
+
_
a) I would require a salary of $20,000 per year, since
I would have to forego any legal practice in order
to be "on tap" and available on almost instant notice.
In these past few years I have lost certain clients
due to my sudden and prolonged absences for special
trips to Chile, Argentina, El Salvador, Santo Domingo,
etc. I would therefore devote all my normal working
time to the activities outlined ink in the foregoing
paragraphs. But I would probably supplement my income
by occasional articles and fiction, written on my
own time.
b) Office rental (if McKenna or X have office available)
would be about $200 per month, with services of a
receptionist included.
c) Costs of telephone: about $240 per year.

became affiliated with a law firm in Los Angeles which
represented many Latin American corporations with California
business connections. In the mid-1950's he became active in
California state politics and served in various capacities in
Democratic Party state and national organizations. He
participated actively in the California gubernatorial campaign
of James Roosevelt, the senatorial campaign of Helen Gahagan
Douglas and both the 1952 and 1956 Stevenson campaigns for the
Presidency. He his been President of the Southern California
Young Democrats, a member of the California Democratic State
Central Committee, a member of the Host Committee for the
1956 Democratic National Convention and a member of the Board
of Directors of the National Democratic Minority Conference.
In 1960 he served as Los Angeles coordinator of the Kennedy
Movement for Americans of Mexican Extraction which, it is
reported, contributed substantially to the success of the
Kennedy campaign in Southern California. His only try for
elective office was in 1958 when he was defeated in his bid
for the position of California Secretary of State.
i
2. in late 1959, TICHBORN was hired by the Agency as a
political action advisor for Agency sponsored election operations
throughout Latin America. In 1961 he became a fulltime
contract agent and was assigned to Mexico City, under personal
cover, to establish a degree of security and mobility which would
permit him to travel readily on third country political action
assignments. Since the beginning of his relationship with the
Agency, he has participated in Agency sponsored political
operations in Cuba, El Salvador, Guatemala, Argentina, Chile and
the Dominican Republic. He has just returned from the Dominican
Republic where he participated in the Station operations. which
contributed to the election of Mr. Belaguer to the Presidency.
The Station has described his role in the election operation as
" ....a vital aspect....at a critical moment in the operation....
also "
Station knows few, if any, people who could have
handled this assignment the way TICHBORN did."
3. \TICHBORN has contributed stories, articles and
interviews to a variety of United States publications. An
interview by TICHBORN of Catherine Anne Porter, Pulitzer prize..
winner, appeared in a recent edition of Harpers and a TICHBORN– –
essay concerning the cultural dichotomy under which Mexican
Americans exist, will appear in an early edition of the American
Heritage publication. He is working on a series of articles
and a book on the population problem in Latin America and is
considering a book on Mexican political institutions,
particularly the Partido Revolucionario Institutional (PRI).

In Re: Necess of moving from Mexico Cher
1. For several years my wife, has suffered in varying
degrees from the high altitude of Mexico City; but we had zizys
always been hoping she would eventually adjust. On the occasions
we went to Acapulco and even Cuernavaca, she has felt much better.
But each time she came back to Mexico City she again felt as if
her head were stuffed with cotton. This whole business came to
crisis-point recently when she went back to Kentucky for a visit
while I was in Santo Domingo. While in Lexington she had a long
consultation with a family friend who teaches at the Univ. of
Kentucky medical school, and he frankly informed her that she
was one of those persons who would never adjust to the Fexico
City altitude. Knowing that I wish to stay in Mexico (particu-
larly because my son by my ex-wife lives her permanently), whe
agreed to investigate the possibility of our moving to Cuernavaca
but we have both reached the conclusion that the Cuernavaca
has very inadequate school facilities for our two children, aged
ŷ and 11. Moreover, the sanitation situation in Cuernavaca is
notoriously bad, and our children have already had difficulties
with amoebas here in Mexico City. Thus, reluctantly, I have
decided that we must back to the United States. Aside from her
physical conditionp, I'm afraid Millie increasing nervous tension
will make it impossible for her to stay here.
(nove
2. Depending upon their respective appeal to the company,
I have been thinking of several projects that would substitute for
my work with Dialogos:
a) The preparation of a thorough in-depth study
-
of PRI and Mexican politics, with projections
as to the future. I would gather all by materials
(interviews, literature, etc.) in a couple of
months; then collate and analyze the materials
in some U.S. university, discussing and analyzing
same with local political science professors.
b) The preparation of a similar study about the
student revolutions now occuring or about to

2. My wife and I are considering two possible sites for
our future home:
}
}
a) Denver, Colorado, where I attended the public
'schools and the Univ. of Denver, and thus have
long-established connections. Denver's
altitude is 2,500 feet less than Fexico City,
about the same altitude as Cuernavaca; so
Millie could probably adjust to it. I could
6. Cambridge, Massachusetts, easily obtain the facilities of the Univ.
-
is also a good possibility library for the above-mentioned studies and
several of my friends on the faculty could
serve as sounding boards for some of my theories
and prophecies in re Mexican politics. My
cover there would be easily established.
b) Washington, D.C. (i.e. Virginia or Maryland)
Here I could have benefit of many sounding-
boards for the above studies. The "cover"
situation for me in Washington would be a bit
more ticklish than in Denver but I could
probably come up with a viable one.
-
Since I do not want to go back to the crabs-in-the-barrel
political situation in California (and I could not escape
it, were I to move back), we have ruled out returning
to that state. In any event, there is no cover I could
devise in California to explain long absences for assign-
ments to South America or the Carribean.
ASSUMING THAT HEADQUARTERS WILL WANT TO DISCUSS THE ABOVE MATTERS
WITH ME AT GREAT LENGTH AND IN PERSON, I PLAN TO GO TO WASHINGTOH
FROM SANTO DOMINGO ABOUT THE FIRST OF JUNE.

Operational Survey in Spain by Edward G. TICHBORN: (P)\\\
1. After considerable coordination, agreement was finally
secured from EUR Division and COS/Madrid for Edward G. Tichborn (P)
to undertake an operational survey in Spain. Chief and Deputy Chief
EUR/IB plus the undersigned had a preliminary meeting with Tichborn"
on 20 June 1967. Background reading was provided him preparatory to
a detailed briefing. The latter was effected by DC/IB and the under-
signed on 21 June 1967.
2.
1
Tichborn's mission is to identify operational targets,
primarily in the business community but not excluding those in
the military establishment, the Government, and the church, in-
cluding Opus Dei. Identification is desired of elements, particu-
larly in the business community, which have political influence now'
and which could be more important after Franco's death. After iden-
tifying such elements, Tichborn is to seek ways and means of access
to them. He will, of course, pay particular attention to the local
Spanish partners of ICAP Iberia in terms of their political activities
and their contacts with key officials. He will assess ICAP Iberia as
a cover mechanism, and in the event of a favorable assessment, explain
in detail how it could be exploited. He will assess one of ICAP Iberia's
local partners whose aunt was a famous RIS agent.
3. Tichborn is leaving New York on 24 June 1967 and will arrive!
in Madrid on the morning of 25 June 1957. He has been given the tele-
phone number and address of DCCS/Madrid, Kr. Osborne Day, who will be
his contact. Tichborn, upon arrival, will telephone Mr. Day. The
latter has been alerted by WOFACT cable of Tichborn's arrival. WUBRIKY/1
will meet Tichborn in Madrid on 28 Jure and make appropriate introductions.
4. It is anticipated that Tichborn will spend about a month in "
Madrid or as long as it is commercially plausible and operationally
necessary to fulfill his mission. Necessary commercial groundwork

return for 1930, not the overt return. Whether an overt return was
filed is not clear an] VICHEUR de remember. In 1963 TICHBORN
was instructed and took aution to stop yayment on his check for the
1903 Caxes. WICHBORN states the check has not been returned or
processed to his knowledge but that he had set aside money in a bank
account for the 1963 and 1904 tazes.

quarters would be processed as a covert return.

and with no waste of time concerned with any negative aspects of
"tho struck who or why wasn't something done". TIGIBORN was cons.
pletely ecoperative and then the meeting was concluded the sincerity

1. Furnished herewith is a request for direct assessment of Covert Tax
Liability form, dated 30 March 1966 for Edward G. TICHDORN. The forms bene
left by Victor D. UNITSKY for completion by TICHBORN, since TICHIARY was not in
Nexico City during UNITSKY's visit.
2. The TICHORN tax case was discussed with UNITSKY who was made aware of the
multitude of problems. The series of cable correspondence in regard to the
location of TICHBORN's 1963 Tax returns and check, the final cable of which, Ref A,
stated that they could be located in a folder titled "Covert Taxes", was of no
avail in lceating the missing, documents. A through search of Station files
failed to uncover them.
3. It is hoped that UNITSKY can effect an assecument for 1964 as well as
1965 taxes as a solution to the matter. Also, it would be appreciated if UNTISKY
could review the reference conaning the 1963 taxes to ascertain if there is any
further action required.

If this turns out

•
the latter point should be kept in mind as a last alternative in
any decision regarding TICHBORN's continued relationship with this
Agency, the Branch believes that the LIREAM publication has im-
proved and has a good chance to gain acceptance and expand its
influence throughout the hemisphere. This being the case, and
as Station plans for expanding TICHBORN's activity within Mexico
take form, we hope his contribution to KUBARK objectives in Mexico
and throughout Latin America will become more substantial and
recognized.
3. As a matter of information, Headquarters would appreciate
TICHBORN preparing a summary of his present cover situation, par-
ticularly his appreciation of his present residence and work
status in Mexico, and his estimate of what the future holds for
him in this regard. Further, we would appreciate any indication
the Station may have concerning TICHBORN's personal plans in regard
to his continued residence in Mexico and his future relationship
with KUBARK.

1. Project LICOLIC has been renewed for Fiscal Year 1966 in
the amount of $19,000 as requested. This approval was effective
2 March 1966.
2. As you are aware there has been a good deal of discussion
here concerning TICHBORN's operational activities and how he might
best contribute to the overall objectives of the Station.
It was
agreed during EDGEBROOK's visit here (See Ref B) that TICHBORN
would be considered henceforth as a full time Station asset and
attention would be given to gaining maximum value from his continued
presence in Mexico. Within this context, however, it should also
be noted that this Project was renewed for Fiscal Year 1966 with
the condition that ".
prior to the end of the current fiscal
year (1966), adequate cover is found to afford TICHBORN not only
the needed mobility and safeguards for his work in behalf of the
Mexico Station, but also for his possible third country political
action assignments.
In addition, the following recommendation
was made in the event Project LIREAM should not be renewed (which
should not really be considered at present since agreement was

få: Cover. TICHBORN has done an excellent job of buildi
His cover with WUSALINE. His area knowledge and language
abijay have proven of real help to the cover company, and he
s shown himself unusually well suited to the needs of that
company. The cover company demands on his time, both on-the-
job mad for foreign and domestic travel, have not interfered with
his operational ualization.

Security. While in Mexico, TICHBORN acted as an
unofficial legal advisor for the Center of Studies and Documentation
which was mentioned in the MIDOWEL flap as being funded by a
CIA conduit. However, there was no publicity in Mexico which"
Linked in with the Center. Similarly there was apparently no
public exposure of the funding of the intellectual magazine with
which he was connected, "Dialogos", by other CÍA conduits. There.
is no available cridence that his security has been compromised
by the MHIDOWEL Rap.
-
7. Termination and Extension.
a!
While TICHBORN has been available for assignments calling
for his abilities as a political action advisor, the Division has not
had the requirements for such activities which were anticipated.
The continuing use of TICHBORN for CIA tasks of lesser priority,
together with the time and travel demands of his new cover business,
Lave kept him well occupied during the period. However, in view
of the future anticipated lack of demand for TICHEORN's services
on a frequent basis, and the comparatively high cost in administra-
tive, financial, and WH case officer ume required, it is felt that
the project should be terminated, effective 30 September 1967.
''
b. As indicated in the section above on "Cover and Security"
TICHEORN has proven himself to be of real value to his cover
company WUSALINE and to DO. Because of their interest in using

agon by WHD. In addition TICHEORN is available for election campion
restarel, special political surveys on selected countries and ed
research requiremems which can utilize his political expertise alld area
knowledge.
4. Backtroizd. In 1959 TICHBORN; a bilingual Harvard-tried
or with political experience, was hired as a poliucal action iso
for Agency-sponsored election operations throughout Latin America.
He 123 párdcipated in political operations in Cuba, El Salvador, Guatema
Chile, Argentina and the Dominican Republic. based in Mexico City
from 1961 umil 1000, he was primarily a Headquarters asset but also
assisted the Momco City Station in its CA program. In August 1966 he
was assigned PCs to New York City where he has been employed for
cover purposes since October 1000 by the DO proprietary WUSALINE.
5. Effectiveness. During the period 1 October 1966 30 June 1967,
WHD has had an opportunity to use TICHBORN in his primary role of
political action advisor on only one occasion. In February TICHEORN
was sent to Puerto Rico to conduct a political action briefing of a
Station: Santo Domingo asset, MANTHEM-4, which task he performed
effectively. In order to maximize the benefits of his availability, he
was assigned the continuing task of monitoring the Dominican Republic
press and analyzing media reactions towards Balaguer and opposition
elements. Several detailed summaries were submitted to the Dominican
desk. A major effort was made to develop an in-depth study of the PRI
party in Mexico. After a number of meetings with Headquarters and

'
The Station appreciates the press analys contained in the
Reference, which was prepared by Edward G. TICHBORN. We feel
that TICHBORN's comments on the press image of EMANTHEM/1|
are particularly useful. As Headquarters is aware, however,
KHANTMEN/1 has not shown himself particularly willing to
take strides to improve his press image and continues to
manifest a rather callous disregard for principles of public
relations in general. While thus of no real immediate use,
a continuing TICHBORN analysis would prove valuable should di
the opportunity present itself to render EMANTHEM/1 public
relations advice and aid. We also believe such an analysis
would be worthwhile in that it would keep TICHBORN himself ||
up to date on the Dominican situation. Should it be decided
to offer EMANTHKH/1 direct public relations or political
advice, TICHBORN, in view of his established rapport with
this individual, would be a natural candidate for the job.
We would therefore appreciate further TICHBORN analysis,
if practicable and convenient.

1. The undersigned on 23 May 1967 reviewed in WH Division
Tichborn's 201 file (4 folders) and related operational files.
Particular attention was given in this review to Tichborn's
security.
2°
The files reflect that Tichborn is very security
conscious. There is no evidence that Tichborn was ever sus-
pected of being a WOFACT operative.
↓
3. Tichborn practiced law in California and was active
in state and national politics. He was recruited as a political
advisor on a part-time basis in 1959 by the CA Staff. In 1962,
he was taken on full-time under contract by WH Division and
assigned to Mexico City. His cover for this assignment was
publishing and movie interests in Mexico and elsewhere in
Latin America. In Mexico City he published a magazine, Dialogos
aimed at left-wing intellectuals. The CI/OA staff review in
1965 stated that Tichborn's cover story was completely accepted
by his friends and associates. The SGSWIRL of Tichborn in 1965
revealed that he had informed only his wife of his association
with WOFACT.
4. The files reflect that Tichborn is very sensitive
about security. He balked at working with a WOFACT officer
in Mexico City, because a friend told Tichborn that the WOFACT
officer not only was WOFACT but had openly admitted it to the
friend. A proposed trip to Bolivia was aborted because Tichborn
felt there was no suitable cover.
1.
5. Tichborn has traveled extensively in Latin America
on training and election assignments. Three countries in which
he worked are Chile, Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. On
these assignments Tichborn used his legal, publishing, and
movie cover. It is understood that he also used aliases and
disguises, although this was not noted in the quick review of:
the files. He can, of course, be debriefed in detail on this
aspect.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT
: Contact Report, 8 May 1967
PARTICIPANTS: Edward G. TICHBORN, Stephen Chaconas, and Lee E. Patton
PLACE
: Shoreham Hotel, 1230-1500 Hours
I -1
1. Preliminary meeting was in the hotel room but the bulk of the dis-
cussion took place during lunch and afterwards. The gist of the discussion
with TICHBORN was as follows:
a. TICHBORN explained how he had been surprised at the sudden
loss of interest by Antonio Menendez in the project and particularly in
introducing TICHBORN to other contacts. TICHBORN says that the
reason for this is Menendez' sudden recognition of the danger to his
political future in even indirectly being connected with what could become
a controversial book. TICHBORN attempted to develop various hypotheses
for the revelation of this fear at this time rather than earlier in the
negotiations. There was, however, no really clear explanation of why
Menendez had so suddenly drawn into his shell.
1
b. TICHBORN was asked whether he felt that in some ways we
were not "taken" by Menendez. He responded with considerable heat by
saying that it was a calculated gamble that "just didn't pay off". He
became very defensive when the discussion turned to the original evaluation
of Antonio Menendez. He says that he is convinced that Menendez has
the information as well as the contacts and in short was the right man but
one who turned out to be unwilling to run the risks involved for the "small
amount of money" he would be paid. TICHBORN attempted to make a
strong case for his belief that Menendez was the right man and emphasized
(somewhat apart from the point) that some day he will have an important
post in a future PRI government. TICHBORN says the whole problem
was discussed with Stan Watson who agreed that the project could not be

productive now due to the sudden reluctance of Antonio Menendez and
Jose Luis Siqueiros to introduce TICHBORN to their contacts. Stan
Watson also felt, according to TICHBORN, that it would be risky for
TICHBORN to contact Gonzalez Casanova, Cholula and Urquidi. While
details of the discussions between Watson and TICHBORN were not
given, it seems that the decision not to proceed was reached without any
major hassle between TICHBORN and Stan Watson. (Comment: TICHBORN
appears to be not at all unhappy about terminating what could have i
become a long and unproductive research effort built on a shaky story
of TICHBORN writing a book on the PRI.)
c. Antonio Menendez wrote up in English some of his comments
based on his approach to the research problem. This 13 page double
spaced report is attached.
P.
d. Chaconas asked TICHBORN how well he knew Carlos Fuentes
(for possible BGBERET targeting). TICHBORN replied that he knew
him very well and that he felt he could approach him directly if he had a
reason for being in Paris (vacation, for example) or wherever Fuentes
is now living. TICHBORN said that he believed Fuentes would accept an
assignment to write articles on North Vietnam based on a future visit
to that area but he also indicated that he believed we could not control
the tone of the articles which would be likely to be pro-North Vietnam.
2. TICHBORN was asked by LEP to review the list of trips TICHBORN
had made outside the country and to confirm the dates and advances involved.
LEP asked TICHBORN to get a list from his cover company of his domestic
trips so that when the cover company submits a claim, WH will have a record
of what trips were authorized for operational purposes involving TICHBORN.
TICHBORN, on the same subject, said that he feels as does his cover company
boss that some other arrangement should be made for some of his travel for
WH. TICHBORN says he feels that the amount of travel he is involved in may
appear unusual to the cover company accountant. LEP agreed that this was
not a good situation over the long run and that he would talk to Gail Allen
about making different arrangements for the future.
"
3. TICHBORN was requested to rebate the $171. 18 owed from the advance
given him in Mexico for his trip there on 17 March. He offered to write out
a check but LEP suggested that he send the check throughthe proper channels
to the post office box number given him. He also promised to send the
accounting for the latest trip to Mexico City in as soon as possible. TICHBORN
was reminded of the need to send in his April and May loan payments which he
agreed to do right away.

6. The files show that Tichborn's magazine,
Dialogos
was funded through Tichborn by various individuals through arrange-
ments made by CCS. The 1D/WH/6 interrogated Tichborn on any
foundation funding. Tichborn could recall only one instance of
foundation funding, some $2-2,500 given Dialogos Editor Remon
Xirau by the Fairfield Foundation. There is also a reference
in the files that one, Louis Mercier, was informed, that ODACID
also supported Dialogos.
->
7. The files reflect very favorably on Tichborn's
performance two reports by the Mexican Station and one
from COS/Santo Domingo are most commendatory. On the negative
side, administrative details tore him.
8. The undersigned has confirmed with Chief, WH/CA
that if DO will take over Tichborn's contract, WH will pay
Tichborn's salary and expenses for the first quarter of FY
1968. Chief, WH/CA is awaiting DO's decision.
9. The undersigned is very favorably impressed by
Tichborn. By 1 October, it is believed that Tichborn will
be sufficiently well-trained in commercial and investment
banking matters to do legal-business consulting on a fee
basis for WUSALINE. He should be able, depending on the
number of operational requirements, to earn a part, if not
all, of his salary. On this basis, it is recommended that
DO assume administration of Tichborn effective 1 July 1965
with the understanding that WH Division will defray Tichborn's
salary and expenses during the first quarter of FY 1968.

SUBJECT:
Outstanding Loan Account
Henry R. Lopez
-
Edward G. TICHBORN (P)
1. In the attached informal note by Edward G.
TICHBORN, he states that he recalls on or about
1
September 10, 1966 that, in a meeting with several
Agency representatives, he received tacit acknowledgement
that there would be no problem for the temporary delay
in his repaying of an outstanding account. None of
the Agency representatives believed to have been present
at this vaguely described meeting specifically recalls
discussions of this outstanding account and specific
arrangements for its handling. Nevertheless, it is
believed quite possible that casual reference to it
may have been made at one of the meetings with TICHBORN
and either through misunderstanding or general oversight,
the problem was not followed through, in that repayments
are being made on a continuing regular basis in satisfactory
manner. Its believed no further action is required pro-
vided that repayment continues at the rate of $125 per
month as agreed until the advance is meet in full.
2. The purpose of this memo is to state the
reason of non-payment during the period August 1966
January 1967 and will be to document TICHBORN's loan
account.

1. On 22 June 1967, WH/6 received an informal listing from
TICHBORN (first requested in April 1966) which was made by the ICAP
accountant (unwitting) of TICHBORN's expenses for travel and enter-
tainment during the period 1 October 1966 31 March 1967. These
expenses were incurred by TICHBORN in (1) developing his cover by
cover company-directed travel; (2) actual Agency-directed travel and
entertainment; and (3) travel and expenses for the primary benefit
of the cover company.

2. WH/6 had earlier submitted Travel Orders on all foreign
travel with the exception of the October 1966 trip to Central America/
Mexico. Following is a listing of the travel involved (largely domestic)
chargeable to the Agency:
a. October 1966 - Travel by air to Central America-Mexico
on ICAP and Silverco business. Cost: about $350. Charge: Probably
Agency, since it contributed to cover development.
b. 10 March 1967 - Travel by rail to Boston from New York City.
Purpose: Inquiry related to PRI study. Note: May have been paid

1. The following administrative details were discussed with
TICHBORN:
a. The change in insurance premiums was explained. He is
to pay $26. 88 for his next premium and in the future will pay
$25.89.
b. His income tax problems were discussed, and he feels the
matter has now been arranged satisfactorily as a result of his trip
to Washington to talk to WH/B&F officers.

c. In regard to Spain--he was told that the situation still has not
been settled but that a decision is expected around the end of April
c. LEP requested a statement from TICHBORN with regard to
his authorization to have a six month moratorium on his $125 a
month loan payments. TICHBORN wrote out a statement per B&F's
request. He also signed a certification for his recent trip to Mexico.
LEP requested TICHBORN to give him a check for the rebate for
his 17 March trip to Mexico of $171. 18. In response to a question
as to how much he had paid Menendez, he said he had given him $500..
2. In a discussion on the objectives and plans for his 25 April trip
to Mexico City, TICHBORN said he intended to contact the following:
Menendez, Siqieros, Cholula, Casanova Gonzalez. He said he had called
and confirmed specific meeting dates with Menendez and Siqieros.
TICHBORN said he could not call Cholula and Casanova because such a
long distance call would seem unusual to these acquaintances. TICHBORN
says he believes a firm decision can be made re the possible success of

"On or about September 10, 1966 I had a meeting with three or
four gentlemen in Washington (as I recall, they were Jerry Droller,
Jack Kaufman, Paull Kittredge and someone else) and I informed
these gentlemen that my moving expenses had been considerably
more than I had estimated. However, I told these gentlemen that
rather than ask for an additional amount, I wished to serve a
moratorium of loan payments for six montlis. One of these
men (with a nod from dother) said "okay--don't worry about it--
just don't ask for an additional allotment. We'll take care of it."
"At this point we moved on to another topic, and I assumed I would
be allowed to skip payments for six (6) months.

SUBJECT
:
Request for Services of Edward G. TICHBORN (P)
1. Pursuant to exploratory discussions participated in by
Mr. Allen of DO, Mr. Munger of EUR, and Mr. Patton of WH, your
approval is requested to assign contract agent Edward G. TICHBORN (P)
to Madrid for approximately three weeks TDY. DO would, of course,
defray the expenses of Tichborn's trip.
2. As you know, Tichborn is provided cover in New York by
DO's proprietary WUSALINE under Project WUBRINY. WUSALINE has
an affiliate in Madrid. The operational potential of WUSALINE's
Spanish affiliate and that of its local directors has not been
fully determined. DO, EUR and COS, Madrid, are interested in
determining the access of the local directors to intelligence
targets and in assessing the affiliate as a cover vehicle. As
WUSALINE's officer concerned with Latin America, Tichborn is
considered a logical choice from the cover viewpoint for this
assignment. He also has considerable WOFACT experience, meets
people easily, is fluent in Spanish, and is a graduate of the
Harvard Law School. The latter fact is important, considering
the legal background of the affiliate's local directors.

3. If you approve, it is envisaged that the operation will
be closely coordinated by DO, EUR, and WH. COS, Madrid has
concurred in a TDY by Tichborn and can provide on-the-spot
guidance.

funding of the magazine Dialogos. TICHBORN made the following
comments:
2.
-
The original $4,000 given him came from the Station, and
there was no mention of any cover story or indication of the ultimate
source of the funds.
b. With regard to the Farfield Foundation contribution to Dialogos,
TICHBORN said that it did not go to him due to some mixup but did
go to Editor Ramon Xirau. This amount was, he recalls, between
$2,000 and $82, 500.
C.
TICHBORN replied in regard to his knowledge of any foundation's
having given support to Dialogos by saying that none did to his
1 knowledge. The only sources he can recall were individuals including
the following: Cass Canfield; McEurce; R. Strauss; Dowling; McKenna
2. With regard to the PRI study on which the decision has been given
on 28 February by Chief, WH/CA to go forward, LEP gave TICHBORN the
following instructions:
à. He was asked to provide prior to his departure a pre-travel
work plan which would include who he is going to see, where, and what
he hopes to accomplish during this one-week stay in Mexico City. He
agreed to submit this information prior to his departure. LEP told

Discussions with WH/6 re Possible Use of Edward G.
Tichborn (P) in Spain
"}
1. The undersigned lunched on 15 December 1966 with Mr. Lee Patten,
the WH/6 Case Officer for Edward G. TICHBORN (P), who is under VUSALINE
cover in New York. Mr. Patten was formerly COS Managua and now Deputy
Chief, WH/6 under Mr. Peul Oberet. He 18 a very competent and conscientious
cace officer. He believes that WH Division should get the most operational
benefits possible from Tichborn, inasmuch as WH Division is paying Tich-
born's salary. He is working diligently to come up with operational
assignments for Tichborn. He has Tichborn working on two research
projects and hopes to establish Tichborn as a political advisor to
the Government of the Dominican Republic. Although WH Division is
suffering budget cuts, which Mr. Patten laments, his project for
Tichborn has been approved for one year and funds are available.
2. In view of Mr. Patten's conscientious approach as casa
officer for Tichborn and some known parochialism in WH, the
undersigned felt it umvise to press. Mr. Patten for more than
epproval for Tichborn to make a 2-3 weeks trip to Spain. In
fect, the undersigned had to present a considerable case for
even this limited use of Tichborn. However, as a result, it
is believed that Mr. Patten will support in WH Division a TDY
in Spain for Tichborn of 2-3 weeks duration at DO expense.
Mr. Patton will call the undersigned on 19 December to report
the WH position.
1.
3. The undersigned seized upon the budget cut point to volunteer
that DO would be amenable to helping out with Tichborn's salary if
WH is hard pressed. Mr. Patten declined, inasmuch as his project
is approved for one your. He hopes to get so many operational benefits
from Tichborn that he will have no problem renewing the project naxt
year. He did admit that DO's willingness to pay Tichborn's expenses
and salary while on a TDY to Spain should help him sell the proposal
to his superiors.
4. The undersigned pointed out that he had not yet approached
the Spanish Desk on a TDY for Tichborn, because it was desired to.

get WII Division's views as a first step. Mr. Patten said that in
the event of WH approval of a TDY to Spain for Tichborn that
he would like to participate with DO and the Spanish Desk in
the briefing of Tichborn. The undersigned readily concurred.
Mr. Patten thinks that Tichborn should not be a global asset
but rather one limited to Latin America. However, he did
concur with the undersigned that Spain represents an exception
because of language and historical ties to Latin America.
Mr. Patten strongly hopes Tichborn can be a political advisor
to the Dominican Republic Goverment. He would not think of
reccementing to his superiors more than a 2-3 weeks TDY for
Tichborn with the understanding that the advisor requirement
has priority. The undersigned pointed out that DDP considers
the Spanish requirement high priority, and that use of Tichborn
for a TDY to Spain would surely be an important justification
when project renoval time comes around.
1
5. It is hoped that WI's position will be favorable for a
2-3 weeks use of Tichborn in Spain. Any pressing of WH for use
of Tichborn over a longer period is a matter of delicacy. The
undersigned knows that WH feels they were coerced into accepting
Project WUENTHER. The undersigned would not recommend pressure.
On the contrary, the undersignsi has hoped to use Tichborn as a
means of opening up Latin America for Project WUBRIKY.

1. TICHBORN arrived at the meeting site in the lobby five minutes
late. We went up to the hotel room where the following business items
were discussed.
a. He was told of his overpay of $872. 37 which he said he would
return at once by check to Manuel P. Goodtwo, mailed to Mr. William
S. Rodgers, P. O. Box 101.46, Woodridge Station.
b. TICHBORN was reminded of the requirement that he pay his
premiums of $3.63 for his health insurance. He was told he owed
for the period of October through January, and it was suggested that
he pay by check directly to the above box. He was told that there was
no expiration notice sent out on the premiums being due; hence, it was
up to him to keep the matter current.

c. He was told that Finance was interested in obtaining his
monthly payments of $125 in repayment of his loan of $3,000.
Apparently he had last paid in July. He requested an extention or
moratorium through January 1967 due to his heavy expenses involved
in moving.

d. 'TICHBORN was shown copies of the "White" FBIS publication.
After he has looked at these, he will notify LEP as to whether he
wants copies in the future mailed to the post office box which he has
now obtained.

TDY trip about a year and a half ago has now been officially written off.

1. Chief and DC/E/IB informed the undersigned that Chief, EUR
does not think Ref A contains sufficient specific informatica to
peruit alequate evaluation of ICAP Iberia's access to intelligence
targets in Spain. Ee, therefore, refuses to permit transmittal to

undersigned that the requirements in Ref B should be more specific
and requested that the undersigned discuss the matter with them.

2. The undersigned had previously discussed Baf B requirements
with WUBKINY/1. Be submitted a list of U. S. firm operating in Spain;
a previous report on the ten leading Spanish banks with the interlocking
commections in industry of the officers and directors of the banks;
end a proposal for additional study. WUBRIKY/1 proposed that, in the
guise of publishing a finencial directory, ICAP approach U. S. firms
operating in Spain and obtain detailed information on their operations.
WUBRIKY/1 also proposed to approach ICAP Iberia's Spanish partner,
Banif S. A, allegedly in behalf of a client bank interested in Spain,
to do a stuły from the political viewpoint on the most significent
power elements in the economic and commercial field. He sold that the
study could be as elaborate as WOFACT is willing to pay. The under-
signed, armád with WUBRIKY/1's thinking and list of U. S. companies,
met with Chief and DC/E/13 at their request on 30 November 1966.
met 3. Chief and DC/E/IB asked some very specific questions on the
access of Bævif, S.A. either as a firm or through its Directors to
intelligence targets. They must be in a position to justify to the
satisfaction of Chief, EUR that ICAP and ICAP Iberia have intelligence
capability which can be operationally exploited. Therefore, ansvers
must be forthcoming on this matter or DO assure them that Banif, S. A.
has such access but can't exploit it unless on officer is assigned to
ICAP Ibaria.

7. The undersigned, on 1 December 1966, mprised WURRINY/1 of the
specific nature of the Spanish Deak requirments, inammuch as WUERINY/1
could go to Spain while on his current trip to Europe. WUBRIKY/1 cald
that mars to such specific questions would require comeone spending
considerable time on the spot. He could not spend the time, but sug-
gested that WH contrast agent, Edward G. TICHBORN (P) be made available
for two weeks assignment with ICAP, Iberia. WUBRINY/1 noted that
Tichbora is fluent in Speich and an experienced hand in ferreting
out such information. Koreover, it would be perfectly natural for
Tichborn to visit ICAP Iberia prior to undertaking commercial ventures
in Latin America. A vinit by Tichborn would be very logical from a
training, viespoint and in the light of the traditional ties between
Spain cad Latin America.
8. The undersigned comours with WUBHIMY/1 that Tichborn would
be an excellent means of obtaining the desired information. Subject
to WH Division's operational desents on Tichborn, it is hoped that
WH Division would make him available for a couple of weeks. This
mattor can be developed further when WURRIRY/1 returns from Europa
and it is determined whether Tichborn will be needed for a two weeks
training job in the Dominican Republic.

f. TICHBORN was told NOT to use his pseudo, TICHBORN, on'
mail (LEP had received an envelope from TICHBORN which carried
his pseudo on the outside as sender but had a phony address).

2. TICHBORN submitted his proposal on the PRI study which he
estimated would cost $3,800. Since it did not have a research plan or
outline, LEP requested him to send one as soon as possible. TICHBORN
believes Menendez is indispensable and that his services are worth
the $2,000 he has projected. TICHBORN feels that his plan is not as":
complete as it might be but would be of a very useful size and scope
and could be completed in six months. LEP briefed TICHBORN on
the peculiarities of our operational interest in research as contrasted to
the traditional academic approach. TICHBORN seemed to understand
these distinctions very clearly.
1
3. TICHBORN had a preliminary report entitled "Press Reaction to
Balaguer". He said that last week he had finally found a newstand on
146th Street where he could buy daily issues (only about a day late)
El Caribe, Listan Diario and Ahora.

4. LEP briefed TICHBORN on our (WH) reluctance to send him on
ICAP missions to other areas. He indicated that he had not heard of the
Spanish trip from John. He quickly said that he thought such a trip was
justifiable from the standpoint of Spanish relations with Latin America,
etc. etc.
1
5. He agreed that he would be of very limited use for ICAP in other
areas and said that he had so informed Train when such travel had been
proposed earlier.

The principal questions asked are listed as follows:
a. What are the normal comercial relations, if any,
between Banif, S. A. and the Spanish Government?
b.
e.
If such relations exist, give details. How did the
commercial relations arice? Was it because of
commercial reascas or relations between individual
Banif Directors and officials of the Spanish Goverment?
If the latter, what is the nature of the relationshipî
Was it friendship or under-the-table deals such as
kickbacks, rebates, etc. Describe each Danif-Spanish
goverment deal giving the substance, participants,
and arrangements?
Does Banif, S.A. or its Directors have connections with
any political group, either in the regins or in the
opposition? Does it contribute funds to any political
groupi
d. Does Banif have any deals with the military on grams
and equipment? If so, give details.
11
What are the specific projects Banif has worked ca in
on
the past two years, either for its cum account or the
recunt of others. Give details.
8. What information does Banif have, or a capability for
obtaining, on Spain's economic, industrial, and financial
situation as it might affect a post-Franco Government.
5. Ro Ref B requirements, Chief and DC/E/IB affined interest
in the most significent power elements in the economic or commercial
field in Spain, particularly those having political ties. They are
interested not in all U. 8. firms operating in Spain, but in those
which aro politically conscious and have the capability by virtus
of size or nature of work to influence political life in Spain.
For example, a mall U. 8. firm raising chickens in Spain is of no
interest. Conversely, the Bank of America in the banking field or
Brow Root in the construction field or a U. S. firm nemufacturing
military equipment could be of great interest. In these firms with
a capability to influence Spanish political life, the Chief and DC/E/IB
would be interested in knowing the U. S. managers in Spain who deal
with the Spanish authorities.

.6. The undersigned asked, and Chief and DC/B/IB agreed, to sand
Chief, DO their specific requirements on a formal basis. Chief and
DC/E/IB opined that Project WUBRIKY appears to have the best capability
for Spain and Project WEBTREE for Portugal.

Edward G. TICHBORN--Salary Overpayment; Payment of Contract
Hospitalization Insurance Premiums
1
7
1
1. The following pertains to a salary overpayment to Edward
G. TICHBORN and procedure for payment of his Contract Hospitali-
zation Insurance premiums.
2. It is requested you advise T:
a. Although full salary for October, 1966 was paid him
by his cover office, Headquarters payroll erroneously sent
the amount of $872.37 to his bank representing his October
salary.
T is to liquidate the overpayment by forwarding y
his check in the amount of $881. ($872.37 plus 8.63 insur-
ance premium) payable to Manuel P. GOODTWO.
91
b. As T
As T, beginning with October, receives full salary
from cover, it will be necessary for him to provide payments
to Headquarters for his contract hospitalization insurance.
The monthly premium is $8.63.
41 "
It is suggested that premium payments be made on a
quarterly basis beginning with the period Oct 66 - Jan 67
inclusive. Subsequent quarterly payments should be made
during the last month of the preceding quarter. Check should
be made payable to Manuel P. GOODTWO.
1
If T indicates quarterly payments are inconvenient,
he may pay in any multiple of one month in advance. In such
case, the initial payment must be for two months (Oct and
Nov). Subsequent payments should be made in advance of the
month for which premium is due (premium for Dec should be
received during Nov, etc.).
Advise T that expiration notices are not sent.
C. The above checks should be forwarded to this office
for processing.
d. If you desire for T to send the checks directly to
me, the following sterile address may be used (let me know
if he is to use).

straighten out his tax responsibilities and
to have him sign his new contract amendment.
The amendment will be sent over to you by
WH/Contracts shortly. Let's get together on
this shortly--call me about Tuesday and maybe

trip.
Taking into account the normal travel delays, the
trip would require about eighteen (18) days.
2.
Budget requirements:
1) Airline fares
->
$550 per person.
This is Pan American Airlines special "winter
fare." Normally, the trip costs $840 per person.
2) Lodging, food and minimal entertainment
expenses - about $35 daily per person.
Total for each person would be about $630.
3) Miscellaneous expenses (cab fares to and from
airports, in-town cab fares, phone calls,
secretarial costs, etc.)
->
about $100.
Since the month of December is generally a slow
business period in most of these countries, we would suggest
that this trip be made in the month of January. 1967

MEMO : Toc ICAP Directors
FRCH: Train and Lopez
IN RE: Projected trip through Latin America
:
(at
Bearing in mind that our executive committee may,
some future but presently undetermined date) desire Lopez
to undertake in-depth surveys of economic conditions in
certain Latin American countries, we consider it highly de-
sirable to establish prior contacts with the banking and
business communities of several selected areas which are
most likely to offer ICAP sound investment opportunities.
Our past experience indicates that it is much easier to
assess spontaneous financial ventures if one is already
acquainted with the business ambiance of a particular country.
Thus, having previously touched base with local bankers and
industrialists, Lopez would have the advantage of thier
personal advice in matters relating to any specific sub-
sequent projects.
1
11
The countries that would seem to offer the most proz-
ising opportunities for ICAP are PERU, CHILE, ARGENTINA.
URUGUAY, BRAZIL and VENEZUELA. Fortunately, we have already
established certain minimal ties with most of these countries,
but it would be best for Lopez himself to become personally
acquainted with our contacts therein.
In order to save time and money, it would be advisable
to visit all these countries in a single round-the-nemisphere

he has not been invited out to lunch by any members of Train's company
in the six weeks he has worked there. He is probably not a detailed man
and is impressed by social position and wealth and consequently likes to
function on a high level. Although there is no real reason to believe that
TICHBORN may see another career ahead, LEP feels there is a possibility
that Train will try to hire him for his company or he may make contacts
in New York City which could lead to his getting a non-CIA job.

within the office.

2. After leaving Train, we went to dinner where the following
subjects were discussed:
a. LEP pointed out clearly that he was "the boss" and responsible
for TICHBORN's operational utilization. TICHBORN was told that
Galt is responsible for the Train commercial setup. There appeared to
be no doubt in his mind as to who calls the shots.
1
b. TICHBORN was told of our need for an experienced Latin
American specialist who could handle political action research on key
issues in certain countries. He was also told of our interest in possible
CA covert action advisory tasks. Our need for someone able to make
meaningful interpretive analyses was explained in some detail and
examples of probable areas and issues were presented. TICHBORN
said he had no special experience in content analysis or survey analysis
techniques. However, he was apparently very much interested in the
idea. He said that he would get the book suggested on content analysis.
He will check into the availability of the Dominican Republic papers
mentioned and let LEP know by 5 November if they can be had in New
York City. He was requested to approach the problem along the general
following lines: Analyze the Bosch anti-government statements for
indications of whom he is trying to reach, how, and for what reason
(since June 15). Similarly analyze the Balaguer statements and determine:
1) Influences the news media is having on his public image.
(2) Where and how could he strengthen this image.
3) What issues should be raised or surpressed.
It was suggested that the try to get issues of El Caribe and Listin Diario!
3. LEP's initial impressions of TICHBORN were as follows: He is very
intelligent and in addition is "sharp". He has a professionally smooth and
friendly manner. He is a natural politican. He is an "operator" and will
collaborate very closely and enthusiastically so long as there is real benefit
in it for him. He is probably sensitive to his Mexican-American ancestory as
indicated by his obvious annoyances (albeit presented jokingly) at the fact that

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT
: Contact Report, 26 October
PARTICIPANTS: (1) Edward G. TICHBORN, John P. C. Train,
Gaft Allen, and Lee E Patton
PLACE
(2) TICHBORN, Allen, and Patton
: (1) Train's apartment at 7800 Park Avenue, 1500-1730 hours.
(2) Mannie Klein's Restaurant 1730-2000 hours
1. During the meeting at Train's, the majority of the discussion
cenetered around ICAP, the trip to Central America and CIA/DO
relations with ICAP. The following points of interest were gleaned in
this period.
a. Train is a highly-trained promoter who is coldly reserved
and capable. He seems to be generally pleased with TICHBORN and
his capabilities for serving the firm as legal advisor, contact man,
and unofficial economic consultant on economic matters.
b. TICHBORN likes his cover company, Train, and the work
itself.
c. Train, if let alone, would use 100% of TICHBORN's time.
When he brought this up, LEP used it as a starting place for briefing
on the general nature of TICHBORN's functions of the past. Train
was told that he would need TICHBORN for "research activities"
in addition to any use involving special trips to Latin America. He
was told we would need 50% or more of TICHBORN's time to carry
out these activities. It was pointed out to him that because of the i
nature of TICHBORN's services, we would have to insist that he be
available for immediate use and hence could not be on any long-range
Train projects which would be difficult to drop. Train accepted
these limitations without visable annoyances or objections.
d. Tichborn says his office cover is good and there are no
indications that he is not accepted for what he purports to be.

Agency/TICHBORN relationship with ine exception of the principal agent
WUBRINY-1, WUERINY-2 and WUBRINY-11 of the WUSALINE project.
•
TICHBORN will enter on duty with WUSALINE on 1 October 1600.
(2) Mechanisms. The WUSALINE mechanism operates as a sub-
sidiary of the investment firm of WUSALIFY and is a DO proprimary.
Arrangements for the use of WUSALINE by WH Division nave seen
coordinated with the DO office conce.ned.
e. Security Evaluation. It is estimated that the danger of a security
compromise in this project is minimal. TICHECRN will be involved in
cover acuvites in WUSALINE which it his academic and area intérests
and experience. WUSALINE mas a well-established cover as a part of the
bona fide WUSALIFY company and his had no security problems which
could adversely effect the cover provider: TICHBORN.
There are no known security risks which could have been passed
on from ms former cover in Mexico City as a consultant with a Mexican
legal firm. The now WUSALINE cover arrangements will strengthen
TICHBORN's cover security by permitting the income backstopping and the
operational and travel flexibility required in his assignment.
1;
In the event of compromise, TICHBORN probably would be discharged
from WUSALINE in order to minimize the damage to that mechanism.
Depending on the gravity of the compromise, steps might be taken by WUSALINE
to disown TICHBORN to protect the cover mechanism and WUSALIFY.
An LCFLUTTER test in May 1965 indicated that TICHBORN had
told no one other than his wife of his relationship with the Agency.
f. Coordination. Coordination outside the Agency is not necessary.

}
1. Contract Agent Edward G. Tichborn, formerly assigned
to Mexico City Station, departed that post on 1 August 1966.
Effective that date he has been assigned PCS to New York City,
New York, to carry out political action tasks as required by
WH Division and other operational components of the Agency.
While located in New York City, he will be employed for cover
purposes by the DODS proprietary WUSALINE.
2. Incident to this transfer, WH Division has agreed
with Tichborn to an increase in salary to $17,000 and a new
contract reflecting this amount as the new gross salary
should be prepared to be effective 1 October 1966. The new
contract should include a salary offset clause to insure
there will be no duplication of payment and reflect the
various hospitalization and insurance benefits included in
the existing contract.
3. Salary payments through 30 September and other costs
arising from his transfer from Mexico City to New York City
should be charged to Project LICOLIC. A new project reflecting
the increase in salary will be prepared by Branch 6 to be
effective as of 1 October 1966, and salary as well as other
operational expenses incurred subsequent to that date should
be charged to the new project. WH Division Branch 6 will have
responsibility for project management as of 1 October.
4. I suggest that this matter be brought before the
reactivated BH agent board for "official ratification."

MEMORANDUM FOR:
SUBJECT
Central Cover Staff, Non-Official Cover
Cover for Edward G. Tichborn
1. Edward G. Tichborn, a Contract Agent, is presently
assigned to Mexico Station under non-official, personal cover.
He is in Mexico ostensibly as a consultant with a Mexican
legal firm and acts as editor/publisher of a left-wing intel-
lectual publication, Dialogos. He has requested reassignment
to the United States, preferably the East Coast and particularly
the New York City area. WH Division has concurred in his
request to leave Mexico City in mid-August 1966 and desires
to arrange suitable cover which would permit rapid disengagement
at any time from regular day-to-day cover duties to undertake
temporary duty assignments throughout Latin America at the
request of this Division.
2. WH Division in its investigation of cover possibilities
discussed the problem with Mr. Stanley Gaines, DO/H, Mr. Robert
Fallow, CA/3 and Mr. Gale Allen, DODS. Mr. Gaines investigated
the possibility of Tichborn's assignment to the Domestic Operations
facility in New York but the New York office did not believe it
could devise suitable cover; Mr. Fallow checked on the possibility
of inserting Tichborn into two of the Covert Action Staff run
operations in the New York area but these were finally judged
as not providing the necessary flexibility; and finally, as you
have seen in cable traffic, Mr. Allen came up with a possibility
of assigning Tichborn to WUSALINE.
3. On the basis of information made available by Mr. Allan,
WH Division believes the WUSALINE proposal has merit and wishes
to develop this cover proposal further. It would appear that a
satisfactory resolution at this time ultimately rests upon WH
Division agreement with Tichborn on terms of his contract,
primarily salary, and WUSALINE agreement that Tichborn's back-
ground is of sufficient depth to provide a modicus of credibility
and his personality is of such a nature that he would be compat-
ible with the principal agent. This will be resolved after
Labor Day when Tichborn will be in the United States and the
WUSALINE principal agent will have returned from a vacation
which he is starting about 1 August. In the meantime, in com-
pliance with regulations for the establishment of non-official
cover, the following background information is provided concerning
Tichborn and is keyed to your memorandum, "Non-Official Cover
Request":

8)

Security Considerations:
1)
KUDARK employment initiated in 1959 and he
has maintained this association since then.
Security approval was last granted by
KUDESK/OA on 8 November 1965. This approval
was given for his use in .. publishing and
furnishing intellectual guidance re Dialogos
magazine and furnishing FI information on
the intelligentsia of Nexico.". Apparently
derogatory information, developed or provided
by Tichborn, was resolved in an LCVLUTTER
given in Mexico City on 14 May 1965, a copy
of which is available in his 201 file.
2)
3)

In LCFLUTTER it was revealed that his wife
was the only individual to whom he has
revealed his relationship with KUBARK.

BIOGRAPHIC DATA SHEET EDWARD G. TICHBORN
MA
1. Edward G. Tichborn, 40, is bilingual and has a wide
range of business and social contacts throughout Latin America.
Following graduation from liarvard Law School in 1948, Tichborn
became affiliated with a law firm in Los Angeles which repre-
sented many Latin American corporations with California business
connections. In the mid-1950's he became active in California
State politics and served in various capacities in Democratic
Party state and national organizations. He participated actively
in the California gubernatorial campaign of James Roosevelt, the
senatorial campaign of Helen Gahagan Douglas and both the 1952 and
1056 Stevenson campaigns for the presidency. He has been
President of the Southern California Young Democrats, a member
of the California Democratic State Central Committee, a member
of the Host Committee for the 1956 Democratic National Convention
and a member of the Board of Directors of the National Democratic
Minority Conference. In 1960 he served as Los Angeles coordin-
ator of the Kennedy Movement for Americans of Mexican Extraction
which, it is reported, contributed substantially to the success
of the Kennedy campaign in Southern California. His only try
for elective office was in 1958 when he was defeated in his
bid for the position of California Secretary of State.
2. In late 1953, Tichborn was hired by the Agency as a
political action advisor for Agency-sponsored election operations
throughout Latin America. In 1961 be became a fulltime contract
agent and was assigned to Mexico City, under personal cover,
to establish a degree of security and mobility which would
permit him to travel readily on third country political action
assignments. Since the beginning of his relationship with the
Agency, he has participated in Agency-sponsored political
operations in Cuba, El Salvador, Guatemala, Argentina, Chile and
the Dominican Republic.
3. Tichborn has contributed stories, articles and inter-
views to a variety of United States publications. An interview
by Tichborn of Catherine Anne Porter, Pulitzer prize winner,
appeared in a recent edition of Harpers and a Tichborn essay
concerning the cultural dichotomy under which Mexican Americans
exist, will appear in an early edition of the American Heritage
publication. He is working on a series of articles and a book
on the population problem in Latin America and is considering
a book on Nexican political institutions, particularly the
Partido Revolucionario Institutional (PEI).
