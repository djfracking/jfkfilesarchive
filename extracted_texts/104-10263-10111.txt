5. I told him that I would appreciate his cooperation in meeting
with two of my friends who are more fully versed in these matters.
He agreed and set the meeting for Monday, 19 January 1965. SKEWER/1
gave me his unlisted private telephone number and suggested that I con-
tact him Monday morning, 19 January 1965, to set time and place for .
the meeting. The number is 842-2120.

MEMORANDUM FOR: The Record
SUBJECT:
Project WUBRINY --Antilles Materials Company, Ltd.,
Discussion by Mr. Edward Stanulis with SKEWER/1.
:
1. I made initial telephonic contact with SKEWER/1 at approximately
1100 hours on 10 January 1965 and made arrangements for a meeting in my.
hotel room for the following day between the hours of 1600 and 1700 to be
followed by another on Tuesday at a time and place that would be convenient
for SKEWER/1. Later in the day SKEWER/1 informed me that he would be
unable to meet with us on Tuesday as he was leaving by air on the evening
of 11 January for a series of appointments in the States.
"I
2. The meeting with SKEWER/1 was held in my hotel room at 1645
hours on 11 January. I told SKEWER/1 that as he knew, one of KUBARK's
prime information targets in Latin America concerned the activities of
Castro's Cuba and that in this connection some of our people had been
thinking for some time that it would be most useful in pursuing this require-
ment to have entree into shipping interests that were active in Caribbean
waters. SKEWER/I said he thought this idea excellent. I further stated
that these people had heard that SKEWER/1's firm was discussing the possi-
bility of entering into an exclusive Caribbean distributorship contract with
Alvin T. Philpotts, Jr., who is associated with the Antilles Materials
Company, Ltd. S. A. of Panama and Puerto Rico, and asked him if he had
any knowledge of the individual or the negotiations. SKEWER/1 replied
that he did not know of either, but that his son would be familiar with both.
3. I asked SKEWER/1 if he would be willing to investigate the situ-
ation discreetly without mentioning any interest on KUBARK's part and at
the same time consider the commercial feasibility of the venture for AMCO.
He agreed..
4. In elaborating on the basic concept, I told SKEWER/1 that if the
proper maritime firm were located (that is, one that may be floundering
now but has commercial viability potential), we would be interested in
placing with the company an individual who possesses the necessary com-
mercial background qualifications, and also has the capability of accompli-
shing certain KUBARK requirements. SKEWER/1 reiterated his conviction
that the concept is an excellent one and said he would do all in his power to

Case Officer Comment:
The meeting with SKEWER/1 confirmed Mr. Philpotts'
report that his relations with the Puerto Rican Cement
Company are good. It also revealed the terms of the
relationship between the Puerto Rican Cement Company
and AMCO which Mr. Philpotte had not reported in detall
to WUBRINY/2. It is obvious that Mr. Philpotts has
sold himself to certain officials in the Puerto Rican
Cement Company who have the confidence of the Company's
top management. The extent to which Mr. Philpotts may
have conned other businessmen into extending credit
and the amount of such credit is a key factor for in-
vestigation by WUBRINY/1 and /2, and Mr. Malia on their
forthcoming trip. It is feared that Mr. Philpotts has
incurred so many debts that the firing of Mr. Philpotts
and reorganization of AMCO would be prohibitively
expensive.

2. Mr. Stanulis said that he had followed the

that KUBARK is interested in AMCO only to the extent

is whether it can be resurrected on a sound commercial
basis. Mr. Stanulis informed SKEWER/1 that KUBARK is
not interested in taking an equity position in AMCO.
3. Mr. Stanulis affirmed unequivocally to Mr.
Allen his previous assessment of SKEWER/1, namely that
SKEWER/1 will do anything to help KUBARK, particularly
against Cuba, Mr. Stanulis will write a report upon
arrival in Washington on or about 13 January 1965.

DECRET

Attachment No. 1 to
DO/HS Memorandum dated
26 August 1944
Operational and
Information
1. Subject was mentioned in two KAPOK Dispatches by
the Chief of Station, San Juan, Puerto Rico, as a possible
candidate through whom leads to persons in the Dominican
Republic could be developed and targeted against the intel-
ligence service and the ruling circles there. In HPSA-1223
and EPSA-941, both dated 11 September 1956, Subject is
mentioned be a good permea for the beginning of covert opera-
tions in the Dominican Republic because he was well known
and considered discreet by those who know hin, Becuase öt
his businesses in the U.S. and the Caribbean area,, Subject
had many persons working for him over a period of years who
owed him some allegiance. Subject's companies did much
business in the Dominican Republic. SXEDADILE, the Station's
contact, was instructed to approach him indirectly through
a cut-out who was Angel FONSECA Jiminez, a personalffriend of
SKEDADILE, a member of the Puerto Rican legislature, a senior
member of the Republican (Statehood) Party, and very close
to Subject.
Information in Subject's PRQ II revealed that he
vas assigned the cryptonym SKEVER/1. The case officer wan
introduced to Subject by one Francisco A. LOPEZ Dominguez,
the U.S. Collector of Customs-in-Charge in Puerto Rico on
a strictly social basis in March 1950 (this was to be
Subject's cover, and there was no monetary remuneration).
Since Subject was considered a loyal U.S. citizen, he was
made witting of KUBARK's interest in persona in the Dominican
Republie who might lead to the target. Be acospied to NABÍNE
KUBARX in this endeavor enthusiatically. Although it was
known that Subject once served as an honorary Vice Consul
for Sweden, a common practice for prominent businessmen in
Latin America, he was not known to have any connections with
a foreign intelligence service. His value to KUBARK lay in
bie personal knowledge of persons and facts in the Dominican
Republic, particularly individuals who travelled there for
legal reasons, as well as his mootal and political status.
The case officer described Subject as "intelligent," "well
educated," and "a political leader whose real strength is
in his being an salightened capitalist." Beenuse ke van
(and in) so prominent, and could not withstand too much
weakening of bis position, he should not be used "directly"
in any operation (in the opinion of the case officer whe
wrote the PBQ evaluation).

At the request of the Justice Department, the
FBI conducted an inquiry, under the Anti-trust Las
of the U.8., into the cement industry in San Juan,
Puerto Rico during December 1958. At. Industrialist
and financier, Bubject reportedly controlled the
cement industry in Puerto Rico. The Antitrust
Division Files of the Department of Justice contain
the results of the inquiry,

Chief of station, San Juan, Puerto Rico,
according to EPBA-1969 dated 4 January 1964, not with
Subject in Pence on 16 December 1963. At this time,
Subject told the Chief of Station that he was considering
the construction of two sizable plants (coment and glass)
the Dominican Republic "as a means of augmenting official
sistance through private enterprise." Subject felt that
it was "imperative for all free nations of the Hemisphere
to do all in their power to help the Dominican Republic
becoms a true Democracy and deny it to the Communista.
this vital task, private capital must also participate
natively." This is the conviction that prompted Bubject
consider building the plants.
In
● According to a memorandum to CI/OA dated 27 May 1960, from
WH/3/DRAH, the inquiry had no effect on its proposed opera-
tional us
One document in the 201, UPGA-12398 dated 7 November
1963, reveals That Bubject was a member of a group of inlin
Lalia
Americans who notionally subsidized ARMCROLL (probably an
asset of WH/SA). JUAN 0404 (IN 33997), 7 December 1961, one
of a number of cables in Bubject's 201 file, indicates that
Bubject took intense interest in Cuban affairs and vas more
than willing to obtain information on Cuban elements,

According to a document in Subject's 201, the
Central Cover Staff had a record, Poge 2178 dated 11 May 1960
in their File #5-3 in connection with WH/3/DRAH'S POA/OA, but
had no active or direct interest in Subject.

1. COS met with SKEWER-1 in Ponce, P. R. on 26 December 1963.
2. During general conversation, SKEWER-1 said he was consider-
ing the construction of two sizeable plants (cement and glass) in
the Dominican Republic as a means of augmenting official assistance
through private enterprise and asked COS's opinion of the venture.
COS responded that this was personal decision for SKEWER-1 to make.
3.
SKEWER-1 said he felt that it was imperative for all free
nations of the Hemisphere to do all in their power to help the
* Dominican Republic become a true democracy and to deny it to the
Communists. In this vital task, he added, private capital must
also participate, actively. This personal conviction, he said, is
what has prompted him to consider building the cement and glass
plants.
3. SKEWER-1 said that he believed the present GODR was
democratically-oriented and would do a good job in the interval
☐ between the Junta reign and elections for a successor government.
He also praised the selection or Donald REID Cabral to succeed
DE LOS SANTOS.

1. A full Operational Approval was issued on 11 September 1961
for use of SKEWER-1 as set forth in the FRQ Part II submitted to liead-
quarters with JU-232 (18 July 1961). Notification of issuance of the

2. If the Station judges that the above-cited PRQ Part II no
longer obtains as to Subject's actual current operational status and
use (Headquarters' file on Subject shows that it does not: e.g.. his
funding of a Station JMWAVE' operation), an up-to-date PRQ Part II
should be submitted in order to amend the OA issued in September 1961.
3. The Station should be guided by the provisions of CSI-F-50–17
with respect to keeping Headquarters informed of current operational

Mr. Stanulis that the Puerto Rican Cement Company looks
with favor on AMCO and is doing business with it through
its Manager, Mr. Alvin T. Philpotts, Jr.
2. Prior to the meeting, Messrs. Allen, Carter, and
Stanulis reviewed the approach to be made to SKEWER/1 in
the light of his favorable view of AMCO. It was agreed.
that no mention would be made of the fact that AMCO is in
poor financial condition or that Mr. Philpotts is inade-
Stress would be laid upon assessment

area.
3. Messrs. Allen, Carter, and Stanults arrived pre-
cisely at 1500 hours at SKEWER' a office on the second floor

consultant who is obtaining background information in the
event KUBARK should decide to proceed with placement of an
officer in AMCO.

4. Mr. Allen informed SKEWER/1 that SUBARK is assessing
the factors bearing on the long-term commercial viability
of AMCO. He explained that such an assessment is necessary
because KUMBAK does not want to place an officer in a
company which is not commercially viable for the long
term. One of the factors bearing on the commercial via-
bility of AMCO is the relationship of the Puerto Rican
Cement Company with AMCO and the terms of any agreements.
We would also like his views on commodities other than
cement which can be shipped from Puerto Rico to the suter
islands and what commodities can be shipped on return
voyages. Another factor of interest is competition in the
shipping field.
5. SKEWER/1 indicated that he needed some clarifi-
cation of KUBARK objectives. Mr. Stanulis reviewed KUBANX
ostensible interest in having an experienced commercial man
in a commercially viable shipping company for the purpose.
of checking on Castro activities in the Caribbean area.
SKEWER/1 assumed that Mr. Philpotts was the man in whom'
we are interested. Mr. Allen dispelled this assumption.
explaining that RUBARK has a candidate whom we would like
to place in a managerial position in AMCO if it is cater-
mined that AMCO is commercially viablo. KUBARK would seek
to effect this placement through a friend on the Board who,
like SKEWER/1, has helped KUBARK in the past and would
undoubtedly help again. SKEWER/1 sold, "Oh, yes, through
the top man in the company. He then asked if Mr. Philpotts
would know of KUBARK interest. Mr. Allen replied no,
emphasizing that our interest should be closely held.
•
6. SKEWER/1 said that he had not realized that we
wanted so much detail and asked if we desired to talk with
the man in his company most familiar with ANCO. Mr. Stanulis
declined, emphasizing that we wanted to keep our interest
in this matter confined solely to SKEWER/1. SKEWER/1 im-
mediately agreed to make the necessary telephone calls to
obtain answers to our questions. As the basis for his
inquiry, he would ask about the amount of credit extenced
by the Puerto Rican Cement Company to AMCO. SKEWER/1 then
made a series of telephone calls to one of his subordinates
named Tomas and also made one call to his son. The following
information was obtained in the above telephone calls:
a. AMCO has 2 or 3 ships under charter and ships.
primarily coment to Martinque, Guadaloupe, Barbados,

b. The Querto Rican Cement Company has a
verbal agreement with Mr. Philpotts granting him
exclusive distribution of cement in Guadaloupe,
Barbados, and Antigua,
C. AMCO currently oves the Puerto Rican
Cement Company $40,000 and is slow in payment.
d. The normal procedure for payment is for
the consignee to pay Mr. Philpotts by a note which
the Puerto Rican Cement Company discounts.
The Puerto Rican Cement Company is currently
examining how much credit it can extend to AMCO.
In this connection the company is examining whether
credit extended to AMCO can be insured under the
Foreign Credit Insurance Association. (FCIA insures
80% of export credit.) If so, the risk to the
Puerto Rican Cement Company would be reduced and
further credit could be extended.
The Puerto Rican Cement Company has sold
133,000 bags of cement to AMCO.

SKEWER/1 imparted the impression that he has absolute
confidence in his subordinates. In calling Tomas, SKEWER/1
said to us that he had gone over the head of his son.
SKEWER/1 was not aware that AMCO Puerto Rico is a subsidiary
of AMCO Panama. When apprised of this fact, he said that
this arrangement is probably for tax purposes.
left the impression that he considers AMCO as a Puerto Rican

company and one worthy of support. He recalled that he had
previously given a job to a Trujillo opponent, Fred Imbert,
whom no one else would hire. Mr. Imbert now has his o'm
shipping company and SKEWER/1 suggested that we assess his
operation. He recalled that Mr. Trujillo had telephoned him
about harboring a criminal. SKENER/I told Trujillo to mind
his own business as would SKEWER/1. Mr. Stanulia indicated
that KUBARK would not want to consider Fred Imbert's opera-
tion, given his family's involvement in the Dominican
Republic. Throughout the conversation, the picture emerged
of a man who trusts his subordinates and who would help an
individual or firm, particularly Puerto Rican, which is also
trying to help his firm.

Dominican Republic Situation Report:

For Headquarters information, the following is a resumé of current
material that is maintained in order to keep reference up-to-date and appli-
eable should the occasion arise. Part I of reference remains the same, how
evor, certain personnel changes outdate the operational saction, Part II of
reference. Under Part II, A, the Mission, Objectives and Tasks as stated in
reference would be correct were the Station actually conducting operations
in the Dominican Republic. However, as the Station is holding any activities
in this direction in abeyance per previous correspondence on the abject, it
is folt that we should restata our tasks to more accurately reflect the šta-
tion's present activity; namely, being prepared for the ascual implementation ||
.
of operations when the occasion arises. Further, that Headquarters may be
cognisant of the Station's current activities) in fulfilling these tasks, there
io included a more current listing of the covert assets maintained for the
future implementation of operations.
2. Under the present situation, the Station's tasks in maintaining
itself in readiness for the possible initiation of operations in the future
Developing andɩmaintaining background information on persons
who are active in anti-Dominican activities in Puerto Rico who, should the
eccasion arise, would be potential agent material. Should anything happen ⠀

undoubtedly return there and become active in politics.
