SUBJECT: Meeting with Victor RICO Galan
1.
The writer had about a one-hour meeting with Victor
RICO Galan at the Lecumberri penitentiary on 13 January 1967..
The meeting was held at the central reception room with
several armed guards present; my civilian escort also
remained in the general area, and there were also some other
civilians present from time to time (I think waiting to see
other prisoners).
2. RICO Galan arrived at the meeting area at about the
same time as I old. After an
After an exchange of greetings and a
warm handshake, I gage RICO Galan my letter of
my letter of Introduct lon
Introduction
(a copy is attached). He read it carefully and then told
mia how glad he was to see me. He Inquired about his friend.
Carlo Cocciolly I replied simply that I had seen him in Rome
before he left for Parls and he was fine. (At the end of
the meeting, RICO Galan asked me to convey his greetings to
Coccioll when I returned to Italy, and of course I said I
would.) I also explained to RICO Galan that I had a bottle
of whiskey for him, but the guards bad refused to let me
bring it in. I think he appreciated the thought.
3. Because of my connection with Coccoll, a pro-
Communist journalist and a friend of RICO Galen in Mexico
for several years, plus the name of my periodical,
Corrispondenza Socialista, RICO Galon apparently assumed that
I was (and accepted me as a fellow Marxist. He expressed
himself spontaneously and I belleve he revealed his true
thoughts during the discussion and in answer to questions.
A friendly rapport was immediately established between us.
4.
I explained at the outset that I was on a tour of
Latin America to study conditions and revolutionary movements.
If he were agreeable, I said I also wished to write a plece
on him for Corrispondenza Socialista. RICO Galen was very
agreebble. I also said that if he wished to write an article
for my periodical, we would pay him. He also found this Idea
agreeable; but qualified his approval by saying he first
wanted to take a look at the periodical to see its "line"
and format.
5. My first substantive question was how he viewed the
revolutionary situation in Latin America. I asked whether
he thought "violent revolution" a necessary stage in the
development of Latin America. He answered quickly and

Egregio Signore:
->
Hi permetta di introdurmi Luigi De Marchi, italiano,
scrittore per il periodico "Corrispondenza Socialista" di
Roma.
In breve, sto facendo un giro d'orizzonte per
1'America Latina. Un amico suo, e compagno di lavoro
mio, Carlo Coccioli, cui vidi a Roma in dicembre prima
della sua partenza per Parigi e della mia per l'America
Latina, mi accenno di Lei e mi prego di farle una visita.
Eccomi qui: Vorrei anche approfittare di questa visita
per fare un cambio di punti di vista con Lei.
Prego tenga la gentilessa di darmi un po del suo tempo
"
Rispettosamente,
Luigi De Marchi

8. I asked RICO Galan for his appraisal and total
evaluation of Fidel Castro Ruz. He said, first of all, if
Cestro is a Communist or what kind of a Communist he is,
nobody knows. He is a great revolutionary leader and a great
tactician, but he can not play the role of liberator of Latin
America for he is too dependent upon Russia and Russia
controls him tightly. I think RICO Galon meant to imply that
Castro has become a tool of the Soviets. He said, Ernesto
"Che" Guevara really wanted Cuba to break away from the
Soviet chains, but Castro is not able to do this As to the
whereabouts of "Che" RICO Galan said that perhaps not even
Fidel Castro knows where he is.
-
9. Regarding Cuban-Soviet conflicts, RICO Galan said
they are more apparent than real. Then I asked him to name
countries of primary Cuban or Soviet Influence. He said
Castro has dominant Influence within the revolutionary move-
ments In Vonezuela, Guatemala, all of Central America, and
Colombia. The Soviets have dominant Influence in Chile,
Argentina and Mexico. However, he added, in Mexico, Castro.
and Moscow see "eye to eye" and have parallel policies, but
the primary power to push these policies is Russia,
10.
RICO Galan sald Communist Chinese influence in Latin
America is negligible.
11. After about an hour, our meeting ended abruptly for
a guard from the office of the prison director came to get
RICO Galan, his lawyer was there to see him. I held him
back for an extra minute and then we parted, reluctantly,
with a worm handshake.
12. The foregoing clearly reveals RICO Galan to be an
unrepentant, fervent revolutionary. He believes, on the
basis of what he said, that he is associated with a winning
cause. He was in high spirits and looked fine.
13. I returned to the Lecumberri Penitentiary at about
5:15 P.M. the same afternoon for another session with RICO
Galan. The main door entrance was closed. I knocked and a
guard opened a little window. I asked to see the Oirector,
but the guard said he was not there. I explained who I was
and what I wanted; when he heard the name of RICO Galan, the
guard said it was impossible to see him and closed the window.
A montent ater 1: knocked again. I asked the guard if he would
deliver a message to RICO Galan from me. He said that also
was Impossible, only the Director could do that. The guard
certainly did his duty.

America was "Indispensable" because the peaceful road to
necessary change was "blocked everywhere". He saw
revolutionary movements on the rise everywhere in Latin.
America. I asked for the Ideological nature and affillations
of these revolutionary movements. He replied that they are
Marxist, but with liberal tendencies, not as rigid as the
International communist revolutionary line.
6. I asked in which countries the revolutionary move-
ments were most advanced. He named Guatemala and Venezuela
In a category by themselves; there the revolutions were
certain to win power Then he gave me a general briefing
on these two countries.
Guatemala: In Guatoneed
n Guatemala, unlike Venezuela,
the Communist Party had not Initiated the armed struggle
The two groups Involved in the armed struggle were the
#13 November" group led by Marco Antonio Yon Sosa, and the
"Fuerza Armada Rebelde (FAR)", led by Cesar Montes, now that
Luis Augusto Turcios is dead. The "13 November" group, he
said, had Trotskyite influences, while the "FAR" was
"Castrista/Independent", and with ties to the Guatemalan
CP but also having differences with the CP. He sald 90%
of the people in Guatemala are peasants and the majority
sympathize and support the armed struggle.
b. Venezuela: Both the CP and the MIR launched
the armed struggle, but they have now abandoned it. I
asked why. He sald both movements confined their efforts
mostly to the cities and took the form of terroristic acts.
These tactics did not get the revolution anywhere. Now the
Frente de Liberacion Nacional (FLN) led by Douglas Bravo
was directing the armed struggle, and this effort will succeed.
L
RICO Galan asked me to read a recent article on Venezuela
by Marlo Menendez Rodriguez, Director of Sucesos, who had
recently been to Venezuela and had Interviewed the FLN leaders.
In answer to my question, RICO Galan described Menendez as a
"periodista Castroista".
7. RICO Galan described Mexico as an apparent
democracy but "police state, tightly held". Here the
"popular movements" are on the rise. In answer to my
question as to who was leading these "popular" and
revolutionary movements in Mexico and Latin America, RICO
Galan replied that there were no leaders like Castro around,'
and the leaders would come from the writers, Intellectuals
and lawyers.

a Guatemala y Venezuela, ya que allí luc revoluciones

general de esos dos países.
"
a.- Guatemala: on Guatemala, a diferencia de Venezuela,
el Partido Comunista no inició la lucha armado. Los dos
grupos involucrados en el levantamiento, fueron el grupo
13 de Noviembre dirigido por CO ANTONIO YOU SOSA,
y la "Fuerza Armada Reholdo", dirigida por CESAR MONTES,
ahora que LUIS AUGUSTO TURCIOS está muerto. El grupo 13

la oblación de Guatemala, son consesinos y que la mayoría
simpatice y apoya la lucha armado.
:
b. Venezuela: Tanto el Partido Comunista como ol MIR
iniciaron la lucha armodo, pero phora la han abandonado. Pro-
cunté la razón. RICO GALAN respondió que ambos movimientos
confineron sus esfuerzos principalmente a los ciudades y
tomaron la forma de actos terroricio. Estos téctices no
llevaron la revolución a noto alguna que ahora el vente de
Liberación Nacional dirigido por DOUGLAS BRAVO está llevando
a cabo la lucha armado, que esto ocfuerzo ci tendrá éxito.

intelectuales y licenciados.

My offer to Rico Galan (para 4) to pay him for an

made at the suggestion of LIENVOT/2.

Of course, I agreed. Also, Rico qualified his comment
that Castro was a great leader

Possible Re-Interview of Victor Rico
Galan (201-336474)
Mexico City 9925 (IN 77986), 14 Jan 67
1.
Reference summarized the undersigned's first
interview with Rico Calan at the Locumberri ponitentiary
on 13 January. At that interview Rico apparantly assumed
and accepted that I was a fellow Marxist journalist, on
a tour of Latin America for the Italian periodical,
CORRISPONDENZA SOCIALISTA. He talked freely as a
revolutionary in general terms about revolutionary
movements and leaders in Latin America, including the
Cuba and Soviet roles.
*
2. My attempt to have a second interview with Rico
was not successful, due to circumstances beyond my and
Rico's control The question now is whether we should
plan to go through with a second interview. The purpose
would be to obtain further information on revolutionary
movements and loaders. (The requiromenta of the Mexican
Government were satisfied with the first interview).
3, One possibility might be for me to see Rico in
about 10-12 days, ostensibly after a return trip to Moxico
from Panama (or Guatemals or some other country). I
could mention to Rico the names of one or two Communist
leadore of the country visited who had briefed me; I could
also reveal some other deception or alated information;
including namos of Castroite leaders; then wait for, or
elicit, Rico's comments and observations.

As noted above, the purpose of a follow-up
A
interview would be to obtain more detailed information
from Rico on the Castro and Soviet roles in supporting
revolutionary movemonts in Latin America, not merely to
obtain further information on the country visited. Tho
approval of the Mexican Government (LITEMPO/8) would
again bo necessary for such a follow-up interview.

character, who did not possess one ounce of sincerity,
and who would never cease being a Marxist revolutionary,
for stripped of his Marxist propaganda weapons Rico was
a nobody. and Rico did not want to be a nobody.

5. We parted with the understanding that L/2 would
phone me at the COS's office later that morning after his
meeting with LITEMPO/8. When he called, at about 11:00
L/2 said LITEMPO/8 11ked the cover story and the plan but
he wanted to increase the chances that Rico would see me
through the following maneuver. LI/8 wanted to send Elena
Garro De. PAZ (the same woman who had brought out Rico's

an interview. I agreed to this scheme. Later that evening

but plans apparantly changed and I did not have any contact

7. At the meeting with Rico I personally handed Rico
the letter of introduction, and got it back from him after
he had read it. In the middle of our interview Rico asked
to have the letter again and I handed it to him. My plan
had been not to have the letter end up in Rico's hands if
possible, but the abrupt ending of the meeting prevented my
getting it back. During the briefing of L/2 by the COS and

Habiendo tomado parte en ina graves discusiones surgidas entre Fidel Castro y
Che Guevara antes del conflicto de Santo Domingo, a proposito de las tácticas,
yu pactos a seguir on America Latina y que ocasionaron la desaparición del Che Guevara
me considero autori-ado a escribir un testimonio politico que desenmascare a Fidel Cas
ro ante los revolucionarios de la America Latina como a un agente del stalinismo. La
derrota de Caamaño, el asesinato de Ucoda el líder peruano, el crimen de Turoios etc.
han sido ejecutados por apentes castristas, encargados de asesinar y destruir a todo
aquot; quo difiera de la linea castrista. Meinera, Cruz vo mismo hemos sido entregados
por agentes tales como Lizalde, Menendez y otros, para callar una verdad que debe ser
conocida por los latinoamericanos. La próxima víctima es Yon Sosa y muchos más que en
aston momentos se esconden de los asesinos. Mi testimonio sería politico e ideologico
ya que yo mismo escribí muchos de los articulos de Quevara, ain Catimar todos los

A
"
On 19-21 August 1966 the Union of Local Societies of Collective Farm
Credit 40-66 (USCE 40-66 Union de Sociedades de Credito Ejidal 40-66)
Mexican Communist Party (ECH Partido Comuniota Mexicano), peasant
front, held to 8th Regional Congress at the USCE 40-66 headquarters
in Torreon, Coahuila, with an attendance of 800 to 1,000 people. Every
state in Mexico was represented. The sting was presided over by Arturo Orons
Gamoz, member of the PCM Central Committee and Secretary for Peasant
Affairs of the PCM Coahuila State Comittee, and Ramon Danzos Palomino
also a member of the PCM Central Committes and head of the Independent
Peasants' Central (CCI - Central Campesino Independiente), another PCM
controlled group in the Laguna area. In addition to these two who spoke,
the
speakers were Arnoldo Martinez Verdugo, First Secretary of tho
PCH Central Committee, and Agustin Borre Gomez, Secretary of Organize-
tion of the PCM Coahuila State Committes, Conspicuous by their absence
ware Antonio Morin Rodrigues, member of the PCM Presidium with special
Interest in PCM political affairs in the Laguna area, and Juan de los
Reyes, member of the PCM Central Committee who lives in the Torreon
area, The main theme of the Congreso vso the aim of the USCE 40-66 to
promote the nationalization
of all privately held agricultural land in
the Laguna area. It wants to divide all land in the Laguna area into
communal farms and completely do away with small private land holding.
Martines said that the Mexican Government was trying to plot against the
PCM and gave as an example the 12-13 August 1966 arrest of Victor Rico
Colen and some 40 others of the Popular Revolutionary Movement (MRP-Movimiento
Revolucionario del Pueblo). He said that the PCM did not espouse the
armed revolutionary policies of Galea, and that the Party was pacifist. 1

trying to organize an interchange of ideas between the Nuevo Leon and
Coahuila PCH State Committees, especially in the field of organizing new

Source Comment: Martinez Verdugo was trying to get the support of
the crowd
Headquarters Comment: A report on this Congress and the speech made
by Martinez Verdugo on 21 August 1966, the closing day, appears in
issues noc. 1845 end 1846, dated 29 August and ↳ September 1966,
respectively, of in Voz de Mexico, official newspaper of the PCM.
The second port of the speech in no. 1846 is extremely interesting
in that Martinez Verdugo takes issue with the manner in which General
Lazaro Cardenas del Rio, leftist former President of Mexico (1934-
1940), proposes to achieve agrarian reform. Further, Martinez Verdugo
décries Cardenas again giving his political support to President Dios
Ordaz,
as he did on 11 August at Ciudad Altamirano, Guerrero when he
also expressed his views on agrarian reform (Cf. Airgras no. 161,
Joint Weeks no. 32, doted 12 August 1966, from the American Embossy,
Mexico City)..
Field Comment: All of the members of this USCE 40-66 Administrative
Council are members of the FCM.:

trade union activity and that a study of the labor situation

Rico Galan were nonetheless totally disgusted with Pages.

According
1. Rolando Collado Ardon, leader of the Guatemalan exile community
in Mexico and a member of the Guatemalan Communist Party (PGT
Partido Guatemalteco del Trabajo), said that the arrest of
Victor Rico Galan on charges of subversion was a good thing
for the PCT. Collado was referring to Rico Galan's influence
on Guatemalan guerrilla leader Marco Antonio Yon Sosa.
to Collado, Rico Galan prevented the PGT from persuading Yon
Sosa to join the Party in 1963 because of Rico's Trotskyist
interference and the aid he gave to Yon Sosa at the timo.
Medical doctors Miguel Cruz Ruiz and Rolf Meiner Huebner, two
of those arrested with Rico Galan, have been associated with
Rico since early 1965. Both were very much involved in the
medical doctors' strikes of lato 1964 which continued into 1965.
When the strikes were finally settled both Cruz Ruiz and Meiner
Heubner were dismissed from their jobs at the Social Security
Hospital at Cuauhtemoc 330. They went directly to Rico Galan
who put them to work, mainly writing medical articles for the
magazine Sucesos for which Rico Galan worked?

was not in accord with the tactics, or even the ideology,
of the Rico Galan group, the latter group should be defended
in the same way as are other political prisoners. The Rico
Galan group has engaged the same lawyers used by the Committee.
In fact, the campaign in behalf of political prisoners must
be pursued with even greater vinor because under the present
Mexican Government policy the PCM or the Popular Socialist
Party (PPS - Partido Popular Socialista) could be accused
of operating schools for training of subversives At the
close of the meeting it was reported that a message had been
received from the Fourth Latin American Students' Congress
(CLAE) in Havana advising that as part of the Campaign for the
Release of Political Prisoners, which will be highlighted
during the period 25 September to 2 October 1966
October 1966, telegrams
will be sent to the President of Mexico from all countries
in Latin America.
Field Comments
1. While there does not appear to be any firm evidence of Ugalde's
membership in the PCM, his activities as a leading figure in the
People's Electoral Front (FZP-Frente Electoral del Pueblo), which
18 controlled by the PCM, have been well reported.

3. According to the Mexico City delly, El Dia, of 30 August 1966, the
office of the Attorney General for the Federal District protested
against the action of a Federal District judge in releasing the
Garay Zuniga brothers from custody on 22 August.

1. At a meeting of leaders of the Mexican Communis (PCM
Martinez
Partido Comunista Mexicano), attended by Arnoldo
Verdugo, Fernando Granados Cortes, Manuel Terrazas Guerrero,
Gerardo Unzueta Lorenzana, and Marcos Leonel Posadas Segura,
there was some discussion of the status of members of the
group, headed by Victor Rico Galan and Raul Ugalde Alvarez,
which was recently arrested for engaging in subversive activi-
ties. It was revealed at this meeting that Ugalde had submitted
an application for membership in the PCM but that he had not
been accepted. He is not, therefore, considered to be a
member of the Party. The same is true of Guillermo Dalam
Pereyra. It is true that Venancio Garay Zuniga and Artemio
Garay Zuniga are PCM members, but they aligned themselves
with the Rico Galan "guerrilla" group on instructions from
the Party to serve as spieg in order to keep the Party informed
on the group's activities.
2.
At a meeting of the Permanent Committee of the National Assembly
for the Freedom of Political Prisoners, Filomeno Mata Alatorre
stated that he was completely removed from the subversive
group and that he had had nothing whatsoever to do with it.
Guillermo Calderon Ita raised the question of the most recent
group of prisoners (the Rico Galan group), and it was agreed
that that group had chosen the easy path - that of taking up
arms; that such a movement would come about eventually, but
that now is not the time; there is no chance for success of an
armed movement. It was agreed that even though the Committee

Veteran and trusted eser of the Popular Socialist Party who has
close, personal confections with ranking members of the Party. He
has been a prolific reporter of reliable information. The reported
information was obte directly from leaders of both the Pre and
the General Union cerere and Peasants of Mexico, The cubstance
of these persons' comments is believed to be accurately reported;
its validity, however, cannot be assessed.

(Summary: Popular Socialist Party (PPS) attitudes toward the
arrest of Victor Rico Galan and others on chartee of conspiring
against the Goverment remain unsympathetic. The Party
intends to stay outside the entire matter, although PPS Sec
retary General Vicente Lombardo Toledano y seize the oppor-
tunity to strike back at some of his enemies by issuing a
statement condemind the plans attributed to colon as Trotskyist.
Within the Party there is considerable skepticion about the
truth of the published charges. While several Party leaders
do not doubt that there is some truth to the charges, they are
quite convinced that there was no danger of imminent rebellion
and that Mexican institutions stood in no peril from Rico
Calan and his friends. The suspicion extate that Rico Galan's case
is a Government ranewer, succesfully used in the yo 55.
Also, it is believed in
the PPS that police accounts of their role in the matter have
been exaggerated to enhance the reputation of the police both
with the President and with the public. The rumor that the
Guatemalan Government may have asked the Mexican Covernment
to silence Rico Galan because of his violent attacks against
the new Guatemalan administration is generally discounted
since the complaints of Guatemalan officials are certainly
of no concern to Mexico.)

There is even a rumor that because of Rico Galan's harsh attacks
on the new Guatemalan administration, the Guatemalan Government
asked the Mexican Government to deal with Pico Galan. This
rumor hozever is regarded as rather ridiculous since the
Noxican Government certainly cares nothing for the opinion
of Guatemalan officials.
1. Bield Comments TLCB-314/10419-66, 18 August 1966, reported earlier
PPS reaction to the arrests
Headquarters Comment: In his inaugural address in December 1964,
President Biaz Crtaz made a point of stressing his desire for
harmonious, relations with Mexico's neighbors both to the north and
to the scuta. His Central American trip in mid-January 1966 was,
among other taing, to promote such relations. Guatemalon friendship
has lately been cold to be a cardinal objective of Mexicon foreign
policy (Cf. State telegram no. 1245, dated 30 August 1966, from the
American Ecbassy in Mexico City).

Victor Rico Galan and his associates can expect neither sym-
pathy nor help from the Popular Socialist Party (PPS Partido
Popular Socialista).
Socialista). Although no official decision has yet
been made by the Party, PPS loaders who have commented un-
officially on the matter have said that for the moment
the
Party will no doubt stay completely outsido tho whole affair
thus proving its total lack of interest in this type of revo-
lutionary activity. It is of course possible that PPS Secrotary
General Vicente Lombardo Tolodano will seizo the opportunity to
issue a statement condemning the entire affair as Trotskyist,
criminal, and utopian. Lombardo may decido to use this oppor-
tunity to strike back at the National Liboration Movement
(MLN – Movimiento de Liberacion Nacional) and others who have
attacked him.
·
Among loaders of both the PPS and the Genoral Union of Workers
and Peasants of Mexico (UGOCM Union General do Obreros y
Campesinos de Zexico), there is a certain skepticism about the
truth of the matter as it has been presented in the press.
It is probably true that arms and materials for manufacturing
explosives were confiscated. It is probably truo
true that indoc
trination sessions on political and revolutionary matters
were held in the houses where the arrosts were mado
And probably the group did have some kind of plan for action.
But, it is simply not true that there was the slightest dangor
of immediate and formidable rebellion from Rico Galan and his
friends.
a
This latter conclusion is based on the fact that Rico Galan
is no guerrilla leader. He is an aggressive intellectual,
radical, but he is not in jail for what he has done but for
his ideas, As for Raul Ugalde Alvarez, named with Rico Galan
as one of the leaders of the group, he has the reputation of
being fuzzy-minded, a leftist adventurer and certainly neither
brave nor dedicated. Further, and Rico Galan is well aware
of this, popular support is essential to the success of rebellion; it
✓ does not exist. The peasants are divided. The workers are controlled
by the Govtranunt, and the middle class is content with the way
things are. Also, there is the formidable precedent of Govern-
ment action against any kind of rebellion, trade union, armed,
and particularly any sort of activity which is Cuban-connected.
The Government has always moved with energy, speed, and offi
ciency to combat such threats as, for example, during the
Railway Workers Strike of 1959. Several leaders of that strike
are still in jail and likely to remain there. Another example
is the September 1965 attack on a military camp at Ciudad Madora,
Chihuahua. While the Government did not feel that this incident
posed any real threat to it, it did not want the bad interna-
tional publicity, so vigilance was increased, activities of
would-be guerrillas were blocked, some were bought off with
money, others with promises, and the matter was promptly and
officiently controlled.
There no doubt is a degree of truth to police charges, but
the melodramatic, almost childish character given to the Rico
Galan movement, the lack of any proven connection between the
movement and leftist/Communist organizations, Rico Galan's
open and well-known connections with Guatemalan guerrilla
leaders and his public support of the Cuban revolution, mako
it very hard to discount the suspicion that this is simply a
Government maneuver. Also, while the police no doubt did
confiscate arms and other materials, the suspicion exists that
the police have inflated their role in order to make themselves
look good both to the President and to public opinion.

Field Comment: The 7 September 1906 issue of Siempre! magazine
(which appeared on the stands on 1 September) carried on pajes
10 and 11 a letter written from prison by Victor Rico Galan
explaining and defending his position and accusing the Mexican
Government of being the real violators of the Constitution.
On the following pages an editorial titled Mexico No Es Una
Insula de Gorilas (Mexico Is Not a Police State) which rejected
all of the points put forth by Rico Galan defended Mexican
institutions and concluded with the observation that time and
space had been devoted to what history would properly record
as a minor incident because of the magazine's devotion to
freedom of expression.

If Siempre: refuses to publish her husband's letter of resig-
nation and sho. seemed to feel that this might be the case,
Manuel Marcue Pardinas of the Communist newsmagazine politica
has assured Rico that he will publish it in Politica.
6 September, the journalfot Froilan Nanjarrez told Antonio
Caram of the Cuban news agency Prensa Latina that Eduardo de
los Rios (Rius), the political cartoonist, had resigned from
Biempre: in protest over the magazine's treatment of Rico
Galan. Bince it was doubtful that Siempre: will publish Rius'
letter of resignation, arrangements have already been made
with Marcue Pardinas to publish it in Politica.
Manjarrez remarked that Siempre! publisher Jose Pages Llergo
had blundered badly in bis handling of the Rico Calan affair
and that people who had never been especially sympathetic to
Rico Galan were none-the-less totally disgusted with Pages.
Rico is being spoken of as a brave man and Pages as a con-
temptible one, according to Manjarres, as a result of the
editorial.

Subject has been a well known leftist journalist in Mexico since at least 1957
Since at least 1960 he has been a steady writer for the two leftist periodicala
Siempre and Politica. Subject was a founding member of the MIN and subsequently
headed that group's Press and Propaganda Committee. He has always been close and
sympathetic to the CASTRO revolution and, in 1961, was reported to be a member
of "Periodistas Mexicanos Amigos de Cuba and of the "Committee for Solidarity

of the FEP and an enemy of the FPS.
9. SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES:
"
Subject was arrested in Aug. 63 for participating in a pro-political prisoner demon-
stration. Subject's pro-CASTRO/Communist writings as well as his contacts with known
Soviet, Satellito and Cuban intelligence perecanal in Mexico during the past few years
leave no doubt as to his "propaganda role, under journalistic cover, on behalf
of these interests. Subject visited Cuba during May-Juno 63 ostensibly to interview
CASTRO after latter's return from the Soviet Union. During thin contact with the Cuban
government, however, he was given the mission of traveling through Central & South
America to contact local Communist/guerrilla loaders for the purpose of persunding
them to begin campaigns of violence and terror to take the pressure off the FAIN in
Venezuela. A secondary mission was to bring about greater unity among the various
Communist and terrorist groups. Subject undertook this assignment during Cct. - Dec 63,
visited Caribbean and South American countries, and contacted kay Communists in oach.
Subject visited the Dominican Republic in Jan 64, and as a result of the contacts made
there with the AFCJ (militant, revolutionary, pro-CASTRO group) was able to serve
during the Dominican crisis of May 65 as a relay point for material and instructions
from Cuba to the AFCJ and also as a resorting channel from Juan F. MENIA, an AFCJ
lender, to the Cuban Intelligence Service and the AFCJ's CASTRC-Cuban leadership in
Cuba.
Subject Xxxxsis returned to Mexice from a trip to Cuba on 11 Tecruary 1966.

Embassy had severely chided Rico for writing an article favorable to
the guerrilla leaders who were killed recently during their assault,
on the army barracks at Madera, Chihuahua.... Rico had been close to
Guevarra rather than Castro, and that since Guevarra's disap-
pearance he had grown noticeably cooler toward Cuba." She added that
although he is a Marxist and is anti-American, Rico is also very
hostile to the Mexican Communist Party (PCM).

12-13 August, Rico arrested with 40 others; the PPS is pleased and will
do nothing to help them. "According to Carlos Sanchez Cardenas of the
PPS National Executive Directorate, it is almost impossible to believe
that a man like Rico could be the leader of an armed rebel movement.
lle has always been considered a urxist intellectual belonging to no
party who has confined his battles to the pages of magazines like Poli-

incapable of doing anything that involved a mass following."

Summary
1. Victor RICO Galan is a prominent pro-Castro Marxist journal-
ist associated with Politica a pro-Communist bi-wookly news magazine
and Siempre a Mexico City Toftist news wockly. In 1961 he wan
reported to be a member of the Periodistas Mexicanos Amigos de Cuba
and the Committee for Solidarity with the Cuban Rovolution. Am of
June 1965 he was reported to be a member of the Fronto Electoral del
Pueblo (FEP). He was a founder of the Movimiento de Liberacion
Nacional (MLN) of which he was the head of the national press and
propaganda committee as of 1962. RICO acted as a Cuban agent in
trips to Central and South America in late 1963 and early 1964.
pro-Castro communist writings as well as his contacts with known
Soviet and Bloc intelligence personnel in Mexico during the past few
years strongly suggest a propaganda role under journalistic cover on
behalf of their interests.
His

basic biographic data. There is a possibility
that he was active in communist affairs in Costa Rica and El Salvador
in the period 1946-1948 and in Colombia in 1949-1950.
3. RICO Galan's prominence in Mexican leftist circles has been
primarily intellectual. In an article in Siempre in March 1963 ho
advocated the foundation of a new political party reflecting the truo
ideology of Lazaro CARDENAS. RICO felt that this would provide the
Mexican loft with a political party truly responsive to the radical
tendencies of the 1910 revolution. This was necessary, in RICO's
view, because the MLN was an action organization rather than a
political party, whose membership covered a political spectrum from
the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) to the Partido
Comunista de Mexico (PCM), and was therefore diluted in effectiveness,
A now party would reprosont a "third position": Socialism in internal
affairs and independence of any bloc in international affairs, With
such a political action arm, wrote RICO, the MLN would dovolop
naturally into a broad national movement such as the FRAP in Chilo.
4. Victor RICO Galan is an ardent supporter of Fidel CASTRO and
is reported to be a close friend of his. In order to gather material
for a biography of CASTRO, RICO, later joined by his wife, visited
Cuba in October 1962 for about two months. He visited Cuba again
during part of May and most of June 1963 when he spent oight days with
CASTRO, five of them at sea in CASTRO's boat, ostensibly to discuss
CASTRO's recent trip to the Soviet Union and his talks with KHRUSCHEV.
On this visit the Cuban Government gave RICO a mission to travel
through Contral and South America to contact local communists and
guerrilla leaders and persuade them to begin immediately campaigns of
violence and terror in order to tako the pressure off the FALN in
Venezuola.“ RICO was also charged to try to bring about greater
unity among the various leftist groups.

5. In the Fall and Winter of 1963 and late 1964 undertook this
mission. Evon though a known leftist he possibly had some arrangement
with the Moxican Government which may have gotten him spocial privi-
logos and support from Mexican embassies in countries where ho visited.
In Guatemala RICO interviewed Gonoral Enrique PERALTA Azurdia the
Chief of Government and then met Raul ALARCON Monsanto, military

Socretary Gonoral of the Mobilizacion Republicana (MR) and a member of
the Contral Committoo of the Nicaraguan Socialist Party (PSN). In
Costa Rica ho mot with one of the MORA brothers, a guerrilla leader.
In Panama ho mot Hugo VICTOR, prosident of the Partido del Pueblo (PDP),
and David TURNER, loader of the Vanguard of National Action (VAN), and
attempted to reconcile them in their dispute for leadership of the
revolution in Panama; ho also urged an immediate program of sabotage
and violonco. RICO wont on to Venezuela to meet Argelia LAYA; he was
probably in contact with the MIR while there. He then wont to Brazil
where he contacted Paulo SCHILLING, coordinator of the Popular Mobi-
lization Front. During this time he may have gone to Cuba briefly and
returned directly to Brazil. After a few days back in Mexico RICO
went to the Dominican Republic where ho attempted unsuccessfully to
obtain photographs of Dominican guorrillas killed the month before,
probably to use them for propaganda purposes. As a result of his
contact with the Agrupacion Politica Catorce Junio (APCJ) in the
Dominican Republic ho was able to servo during the Dominican Republic
crisis of May 1965 as a relay point for material and instructions
from Cuba to the APCJ and also as a reporting channel from Juan B.
MEJIA and APCJ leaders to the Cuban Intelligence Service and the
APCJ's CASTRO Cuban leadership in Cuba. After his return to Mexico
City RICO visited Cuba again ostensibly to interview CASTRO on his
most recent trip to the Soviet Union and probably to report on his
mission.
6. RICO Galan continued his interest in the guerrilla struggle
and was reported to have entered Guatemala clandestinoly in August
1964 and possibly several times before then as well, to visit YON
Sosa and his guerrillas. In March 1966, after having returned from
Cuba the month before, he planned to travel again to Guatemala
clandestinely in order to investigato the disappearance of Victor
Manuel GUTIERREZ, leader of the PGT and of the Guatemalan exile
community in Mexico, who had recently returned to Guatemala.
7. RICO's writings show an ardent support for the guerrillas
in Latin America and for their method in achieving the revolution.
In October 1964 the Guatemalan Armed Forces captured a number of
tape recorders and tapes from the guerrillas including one by

Upon receipt of the letter sent via the reference above;
the Rexico City Station officers concerned discussed the best
method of delivering the letter to Rico Galan so the operation→
would appear natural and also to be sure the letter would be
received by him It was decided, finally, to have LIRICE-11
deliver the letter to Rico's wife with a short explanation of
its background. Two weeks were spent in trying to locate Inge
dé Galan and the efforts were fruitless Tho Station then decid-
ed to have LIRICE-11 deliver the letter to Elena Garro an old
friend of Rico's. LIRICE-11 tried for a week and one half to
find her at home with negative results. The Station then in-
structed him to leave the letter at her home with a request that
it be passed to Rico. Attached is a copy of the covering letter

Since June 1965 until as recently as March 1967
Subject has been reported receiving telephone calls from a
"Carlos" with a non-Mexican accent Normally Subject and
"Carlos" simply agree to meet, without naming the place.
vice "Sonor Jacobo" has been mentioned in an unclear, context
during their conversations (Scurce: LIFEAT) Although "Carlos
as a name is not much of a load, the Station suggests that he
might be identical with Carlos ILLESCAS Aguirre (Hernandez)
(P-1901, 201-764855), Guatemalan Communist living in Mexico.
Although ILLESCAS has been very quiet since 1964, when the
Mexican authorities clamped down on him, he is known to have
been used by the Soviets in the past and probably still worká
with them. In 1953, when ILLESCAS was still working at the
la
Guatemalan Embassy in Mexico, he reportedly was very active
as a courier for the Soviets (Source: LINLUCK). In 1959
ILLESCAS was reported in contact with Nikolay Vasilyevich
AXSENOV (201-106469), suspect KGB officer who ãa then
Assistant Soviet Cultural Attache a job later taken over by
Subject (Source: LIFEAT). In 1961-62 ILLESCAS was reported
to be still in contact with the Soviets in regard to guerrilla
plans for Guatemala (Source: LINLUCK). On 23 August 1967 it
WAB-reported that ILLESCAS passed 22,000 Mexican pesos to one.
of the Guatemalan Communist leaders in Mexico. This money was
described as a monthly subsidy from either the Cubans or the
Soviets intended to help the Guatemalan Communists in jail in
Mexico. (Source: LIREBEL-2). The above references to "Senor
Jacobo" might possibly have meant Jacobo ARBENZ Guzman, former
president of Guatemala; unfortunately the tapes of the conver-
sations have been erased and the exact context in which this
same was mentioned can no longer be reconstructed...
L
8. Hava (Eva) (P-11484), wife of Guatemalan Communist
Sergio de la PENA, was reported to have met Subject in May 1965.
On 29 May 1965 Subject invited Hava to dinner, apparently at the.
suggestion of Enrique SENO Caley, Mexican Communist leader.
Subject told Hava that he was interested in her contacts with
(other embassies and particularly asked her to put him in touch
with Americans. Hava vas subsequently reported having Subject
and his wife to dinner on several occasions. (Source: LIFEAT).
(It seems, obvious that-Subject was fishing for leads through
Hava; however, Hlava's Guatemalan contacts may well have been of
no interest to Subject.)
WN
9 Victor RICO Galan (P-7354, 201-336474), Spanish-bora
Mexican Communist journalist, <agent of Cuban government known
to have been sent by the Cubane to talk to Guatemalan guer-
rillas in 1963, in prison since August 1966 for subversive
activities allegedly directed against the Mexican government
was in frequent contact with Subject in 1965-66. They usual
simply arranged to see each other to discuse undisclosed
matters, and Subject apparently called RICO from a pay phone
rather than from his office. (Source: LIFEAT) (Subject has..
apparently provided 'RICG with propaganda for news articles,
but they appear to have had other common interests as well; onDe
of which could well have been RICO's guerrilla activities.)

5. Jose Maria ALVAREZ Posada (P-4415) is a Spanish Con-
muntat employed by the Soviet Press Office as an editor for
their Bulletin. He seems to be very active among Spanish
Communists in Mexico and also frequently sets up meetings bo-
tween Bubject and Juan REJANO Porras (P-1027, 201-109935).
The latter is one of the leaders of the Spanish Communist
Party in Mexico but also has close ties to other Communist
groups particularly the Cubans and Czechs as well as tho
Mexicana, and on at least one occasion he was seen going to
the Cuban Embassy with one of the leaders of the Guatemalan
Communist Party in Mexico. REJANO 18 in almost daily contact
with ALVAREZ Posada, often says that he needs to 800-Subject =
urgently, has several times asked about scholarships to the ans
USSR for unidentified persons. on 21 July 1967 it was reported
that Subject had given ALVAREZ Posada a letter that was to be

personally at the latter's house. $3
-
6. In view of ALVAREZ Posada's apparent acting as a cut-
out for Subject, as described above, the following item may
also be connected with Subject. On 29 June 1967" "Max" told
ALVAREZ Posada that there was a letter "there" from Guatemala
that had been there since 22 June but "Max" had not been able
to reach ALVAREZ Posada before. CALVAREZ Posada said he would
be home after 1600 hours (so that "Max" could bring him the
letter). (Source: LIFEAT). Although it in pure guesspork,
the Station suggests that "Max" might be Maximiliano #SALAZAR
Garcia (201-183293), a Guatemalan Communist living in Mexico.
SALAZAR has been very quiet recently, but on 14 July 1965 ha
was reported in contact with Carlos ILLESCAS Aguirre, (cf. below)
about finding housing and a job for an unidentified boy, and
it is entirely possible that he continues to be active behind
the scobes in Guatemalan exile affaira.

TACTICS DID NOT PROMOTE THE REVOLUTIONARY CAUSE AT ALL.
THE ARMED STRUGGLE IS NOW DIRECTED BY THE ARMED FORCES OF
NATIONAL LIFERATION (FALN) LED BY DOUGIAS BRAVO AND WILL
NOW SUCCEED. (HEADQUARTERS COMMENT: RICO GALAN IS ECHOING
THE LINE OF DOUGLAS BRAVO, LEADER OF THE DISSIDENT YALN, IN
ACCUSING THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF VENEZUELA (PCV) AND THE MIR
OF ABANDONING THE "ARMED STRUGGLE." BOTH THE ICV AND THE MIR
HAVE HAD, AND CONTINUE TO HAVE, RURAL GUERRILLA FORCES AS WELL
AS URBAN TERRORIST UNITS. ALTHOUGH A SOFT-LINE FACTION OF THE
MIR RENOUNCED VIOLENCE EARLY IN 1964, THE MORE MILITA WING
CONTINUED THIS POLICY, AFTER FIRST QUGTING THE SOFT-LINERS.)
RICO CALAN DESCRIBED MEXICO AS AN APPARENT DEMOCRACY BUT A "POLICE STATE,
TIGHTLY HELD.' HE RELIEVED THAT POPULAR MOVEMENTS IN MEXICO AND BLOWHERE IN
11.
LATIN AMERICA WERE ON THE RISE. SINCE THERE WERE NO LEADERS LIKE CASTRO AROUND,
RICO CALAN BELIEVED THAT THE LEADERS OF THESE POPULAR MOVEMENTS WOULD COME FROM THE
WRITERS, THE INTELLECTUALS, AND THE LAWYERS."
5. REGARDING FIDEL CASTRO, RICO CALAN SAYS THAT NO ONE KNOWS WHETHER CASTRO IS
A COMMUNIST OR WHAT KIND OF COMUNIST HE MIGHT BE. HE IS A GREAT REVOLUTIONARY
LEADER AND A GREAT TACTICIAN, BUT HE CANNOT PLAY THE ROLE OF LIBERATOR OF LATIN
AMERICA FOR HE IS TOO DEFENDENT ON THE SOVIET UNION, AND THE SOVIET UNION CONTROLS
HIM TIGHTLY. REGARDING CUBA-SOVIET CONFLICTS, RICO GALAN SAID THEY WERE MORE APPARER

3. GUATEMALA AND VZICIZUZIA ARE THE TWO COUNTRIES. IN WHICH THE REVOLUTIONAL

COMMENTS TO MAKE ON THE SITUATION IN THESE TWO COUNTRIES
