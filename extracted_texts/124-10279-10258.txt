Cuban Exile Activities
On January 28, 1960, PSI MIGUEL ANDRES DE LEON ROJAS
reported that responsible Cuban exile groups in Mexico City and
the United States, who have supported Dr. EMILIO NUNEZ PORTUONDO,
are convinced that General JOSE ELEUTERIO PEDRAZA CABRERA, who
commands a group of Cuban military exiles" in the Dominican
Republic, would not be a wise selection as the military leader
of the attempt to overthrow the CASTRO government. The PSI
further advised that these Cuban exile groups believe that
PEDRO LUIS DIAZ LANZ, former Chief of the Cuban Air Force,
would be a much better military leader. (A)
The PSI also advised that information received from
sources within Cuba reflected that FIDEL CASTRO had prepared a
decree ordering the United States to vacate the Guantanamo
Naval Base. According to this information, the decree was
originally prepared in late November, 1959, but had not yet
been signed for issuance. (2) y

The PSI further reported that he had heard reports in
Miami, Florida, of an invasion attempt which allegedly would
be made by supporters of ROLANDO MASFERRER, a Cuban exile who
resides in Miami. The PSI stated that MASFERRER, ROBERTO
FERNANDEZ MIRANDA, NORMAN ROTHMAN, and their associates form a
group which is not regarded in a favorable light by responsible
Cuban exiles or by responsible elements within Cuba. The PSI
stated that from the information available to him in Miami he
doubted very much that MASFERRER would be able to make an
attempt at invading Cuba or, if an attempt were made, that it
would be successful.
Nicaragua
·(u)
PSI DE LEON also advised on January 28 that he had
received information from within Cuba that ERNESTO "CHE"
GUEVARA has not abandoned his project to utilize pro-Communist
Nicaraguan exiles and "Cuban "volunteers" in an attempt to
invade Nicaragua. This source advised that approximately 400
guerrillas have been trained to make up the invasion force.
The PSI stated he had received no information as to the timing
of such an attempt, but expressed doubt that it would occur in
the immediate future in view of the concern of the Cuban Govern-
i
ment over a possible early invasion attempt by Cuban exiles. (4

age and is disposed to follow an international policy that
will not only benefit Mexico but its sister Latin American
countries who are bound together not only by historical ties
but by the same economic and social conditions and identical
perspectives. In apparent reference to DAVID ALFARO SIQUEIROS, A
leading PCM figure, he stated that some people, who are unable
to understand national and international politics although
they expound them daily, have been critical of President LOPEZ
WMATEOS trip. During the course of the President's trip
SIQUEIROS made a statement to the press wherein he criticized
the President for not accepting a bid to visit Cuba and stated
that President LOPEZ MATEOS was merely laying the ground work
for a subsequent visit by President EISENHOWER. LOMBARDO was
critical of President LOPEZ MATEOS in certain respects,
particularly in connection with the imprisonment of the
railroad strike agitators and PCM and POCM leaders.
ACTION TAKEN: None. Will be disseminated in the
next report on the PP.
