C. Effectiveness
Party
Winston occupies his top post in the CPUSA by virtue
of the fact that Hall, when he became General Secretary, needed
a prominent Negro party leader to give him support because of
his own Lack of following among Party Negroes, Since Winston
is now an important rigure in the national leadership, Hall and
other Negro functionaries are obliged to be attentive to and
respectful of him.
Hall is apparently resentral that Winston is essential
to his continuing Styro support, in the Party and that he must
nocess rily treat winston with diference. Hall reportedly would

Winston stays clear of personal intrigue ano man
In the Party's Negro caure, which is perpetually divided and rife
with unending rivalry and backbiting, he strives to play the role
of the middleman or the pacifier.
As a speaker, Winston is of the rough-and-tumble type
who is a good agitator. He makes an effort to assume a dignified
stance on the platform and seldom resorts to exaggerated oratorical
antics.
He gives every indication--in speech and in vocabulary--
of having had minimal schooling. His extempore language is
choppy, disorganized, colloquial, and full of mispronunciation
of even simple words. He has virtually no writing skill and is
not known to have authored any type of document during his long
career in the Party. Speeches, reports, and articles issued
under his name are the work of ghost writers..

Henry Winston hasserphasized that the policy of the present-day government of the
United States becomes increasingly, menacing. Henry Winston said this policy leads t
intensification of racism and anticomunism as component parts of the programme, aimed
at elimination of the resistance to the governments line'.
Current reprisals against civil right fighters are only the beginning of a campaign
which was launched with the aim of breaking the resistance of the Negro people.
This campaign is now spearheaded against Angela Davis, a symbol of struggle against
racism and anticommunism. These reprisals, if they are not duly rebuffed, will
tomorrow spread to the whole of the American people, blacks and whites. The struggle.
in defence of Angela Davis and other political prisoners is, therefore, the matter of
honour for all Americans, who cherish freedom and peace.
