The two MVD officers described in this report are part
small (and otherwise unidentified) section of the Minsk City
Internal Affairs Directorate (GUVD) on Dobromyshlenskiy pereulok
(the subject of a separate report). This section is engaged in
the surveillance of foreigners for the apparent purpose of identify
ing those of their Soviet contacts who may be black marketeers.
2. KOVALEV, Vladimir, whose nickname is "Boni", holds the
rank of senior lieutenant. Born in about 1949, he is 174 cm tall
of medium build, and has slightly wavy short blond hair. He is
very nearsighted and wears glasses. He dresses modestly and
inconspicuously and has the appearance of an "educated and cultured"
person.
3. KOVALEV is married to Tamara nee MATVEYEVA, and they have
a son, born in about 1972, who attends a special kindergarden for
the children of high-ranking and other privileged officials.
KOVALEVA, the daughter of a retired KGB lieutenant colonel, is a
graduate of an economics institute and works as a senior economist
for the State Committee for Standards, earning 170 rubles per month.
The KOVALEVS live on Bobruyskaya ulitsa directly opposite a bus
☐ station.
4. KOVALEV is a graduate of the Minsk. State
the Minsk State Pedagogical
Institute of Foreign Languages, where he studied Spanish and English
in the Department of Translating. After graduation, XOVALEV left
Minsk for one year to go into the Army. However, Source found this
hard to believe, as he knew that KOVALEY had been turned down for
military service in 1966 because of nearsightedness. During the
time that KOVALEV was in the Army, his wife told Source that where
her husband was serving "they put army boots on once a month, just
for show." KOVALEV's military service card (voyennyy bilet).
nevertheless indicates both his 1966 rejection and the year that he
supposedly spent in the Army.

5. A KGB officer meets each of his agents (filer was the word
used by Source) in a safe house (konspirativnaya kvartira). Other
officers are not supposed to know who these agents are, and this
conspiracy" is a matter of great pride to them. Source was once
caught leaving the hotel room of a Bulgarian girl with whom he had
spent the night, but he was released when he gave AKSENOV's name to
the junior KGB officer on duty (thereby implying that Source was on
assignment for AKSENOY).
16.
Source described KGB influence as "overwhelming".
'
For example,
a Soviet going abroad on an official assignment cannot refuse to
cooperate with the KGB because such refusal would mean that the
person wouldn't be able to travel, as the KGB has a say about his
final clearance. Source also gave the example of an applicant for an
unimportant job with the Minsk Symphony who was originally turned
down. But when AKSENOV spoke to the KGB officer responsible for the
Symphony, the applicant was not only hired but received the greatest
respect from the Symphony Director during the entire period of his
employment.
7. The KGB likes to recruit retired military personnel (otstavniki)
because they are considered politically reliable and patriotic.
Many otstavniki recruited by the KGB are former Osobyy otdel (Special
Section, security functions) people, so KGB work is not a novelty for
them. Such retirees are frequently used in stationary positions,
reporting on or guarding specific areas.
.
8. Since the KGB relies on spotters for the selection of its.
agents, the spotters themselves can get into trouble if they recommend
the "wrong" person. This means that the spotters are afraid to select
clever people, so in the end they select mediocre ones. Selection
is determined by the following: If the prospective agent or informer

Source obtained most of the information in this report from
Anatoliy Aleksandrovich AKSENOV, a KGB senior
a KGB senior lieutenant who was
charge of the KGS unit in the Yubileynaya Hotel in Minsk, and from
friends and classmates who are now KGB and militia officers.
'
2. Source's curiosity about the selection and recruitment of KGB
personnel was aroused when AKSENOV told him that he was considering
the recruitment of Source as a KGB informant. Source asked AKSENOV
who is selected and for what reasons. AKSENOV replied that the KGB
usually uses spotters, who recommend people for recruitment. Back-
ground is important. A person from a peasant or worker's family is
considered a better choice, and he must either be a quiet and colorless
type who blends into the circle of people in which he operates, or
else a conspicuous loudmouth who asks embarrassing questions. The
latter would be more likely suspect of being a member of the opposi-
tion rather than a XGB informant. The average informant, according
to AKSENOV, is not very bright because KGB officers themselves are
not particularly intelligent and are afraid of anyone who is smarter
than they. Source says that he was never recruited.

"
3. Both Source and AKSENOV think that in the remote areas of the
USSR there are very few cases of such a recruitment pitch being.
turned down. Far from the big cities the KGB is an all-powerful
instrument, and anyone who refuses just to report on the conversations
of his friends in the name of patriotism will end up with dismal
career prospects unless he has friends in high places. However, it
is unlikely that such a person would be chosen for a KGB recruitment
pitch in the first place. Therefore most of the lower levels of the
KGB consist of people from simple backgrounds for whom there are no
other career prospects and who prefer this kind of service to being
in the Army.
■
"
4. The KGB officers in the Belorussian SSR are also those who
are not bright enough to make a career in some other field, such as
science, engineering, or foreign languages, but they differ from
the lower-level cadres in that they are the sons of high-ranking

The spotter is supposed to turn
334
list of potential recruits
and write a recommendation for each person. The prospective agent or
informer is then called in and an offer to cooperate with the KGB is
made. Source never heard anything about money being mentioned, but
the KGB does offer help in the advancement of one's career. The
initial assignments are very simple: The agent or informer just has
to keep his eyes and ears open and to report anything that smacks o
anti-government or illegal activity. Who can refuse such a call to
patriotic vigilance? And if one does, he might well be classified
as an enemy of the state and end up doing the lowliest physical labor
rather than enjoying a promising career
10
AKSENOV also told Source that the KGB &
usual opens file
on a Soviet citizen who corresponds with anyone abroad. After this
his telephone conversations are monitored and periodically recorded
And finally, KGB agents and informers who come into contact with
him will be asked to report on him.
11. Source once asked AKSENOV what the KGB would consider its
greatest accomplishment. AKSENOV replied that the discovery of
secret agent (nelegal) would be first on the list, followed by the
discovery of an illegal printing press. Without printed matter a
revolution cannot take place, according to AKSENOV. Third on the
list is the discovery of the illegal possession of a rifled weapon
such as a rifle or pistol. This last item would not be considered
particularly important in itself, but a KGB officer can do very well
for himself if he plays his cards right. He must time the discovery
of the illegal weapon with a public event involving the visit of an
important Party or government dignitary. Thus, in the eyes of his
superiors, his discovery is tantamount to thwarting an assassination
attempt. Any one of the three accomplishments would lead to automatic
promotion, a medal, and tenure for life in the KGB.

accounts to the OBKhSS (Department for Combatting the Embezzlement
of Socialist Property and Speculation) of the militia for investiga-
tion. Source got this information from a militia lieutenant who
was an OBKhSS officer in his rayon.
2.
Since savings banks do not have a centralized accounting
system, another way of keeping large amounts of money is to have
accounts in several banks, as long as none of them exceeds the
thousand-ruble limit.
"
3.. One of the best ways of keeping money when traveling, or
even at home, is in the form of an akkreditiv (a personalized
cashier's check). An akkreditiv can be bought at any bank or
savings institution and can be cashed anywhere at any time but
only by the person to whom it is made out and only on presentation
of an internal passport. Without the passport, the akkreditiv
cannot be cashed, thereby making it a safer form of keeping money
than currency.
4.
If money is to be kept at home, it is somewhat less
suspicious to have it in the form of three-percent government loan
bonds (trekhprotsentnyy zaem). These are not personalized and can
be
bé cashed at any time at a small discount. They also have the
advantage of a prize that can be won at one of the periodic
drawings based on their numbers.

He was a street photographer at the Outside

Photographic Work.
1976-departure
He had miscellaneous employment.
RESIDENCE IN THE USSR: From before 1966 to his
emigration, UZLOV lived at 47 Volgogradskaya ulitsa in Minsk
9
EMIGRATION: UZLOV emigrated from the USSR on 28 November
1976. He arrived in Rome shortly thereafter, and departed for
the United States on 22 March 1977.
10. PRESENT SITUATION: UZLOV currently lives at 414 Avenue
apartment 68 in Brooklyn, NY 11230. He is unemployed.
11. PERSONAL EVALUATION: UZLOV is a smart, witty, outgoing,
aggressive person, accustomed to living by his wits. He is
willing to take chances and play roles, but, at the same time,
he is not afraid of hard work, as long as it pays well. He is
somewhat given to romanticizing, for example, by seeking a job
in intelligence and not fully realizing that it is a steady
and, often, dull job. He is not persistent, not able to stick
to his studies or hold a job; instead, he prefers to work hard
for shorter periods to earn money, and then do nothing.
'
:
%
UZLOV seemed to be completely won over by the United
States, saying that he is willing to do anything that would be
asked of him, such as his voluntarily bringing in photographs
of some of the personalities he described, and suggesting that
he would try to use the loose code system that he had established
with his friends back in Minsk to obtain information for us,
if we so require. At the last possible moment, he admitted
that he was incarcerated in the USSR for participation in a
fight, but was later found innocent by a higher court.
Physically, UZLOV is good-looking, trim, athletic,
and is a former boxer, who trys to keep himself in good shape.
He likes to dress well and, seemingly, no longer drinks to
excess, as he used to do in the Soviet Union.

3. In the Yubileynaya Hotel this unit always had four or
five persons on duty. During the day it had two privates and
a sergeant in uniform and two officers in civilian attire. At
night, when on duty, all of them usually wore militia uniforms.
Aside from the above-mentioned militia functions, their actual
mission was to prevent what they considered to be unnecessary
contact of Soviet citizens with foreigners, to observe any
suspicious actions by either, and to ensure that only approved:
persons had access to the hotel. All other Soviet citizens
would be stopped, their documents checked, and their business
questioned. An officer from such a unit once stopped Source
after he had spent the night with a Bulgarian girl in the hotel.
Source thinks he was discovered through audio surveillance.

REFERENCE:
SAG Memo Dated 8 April 1977
Reference alerts us to provide OI require-

Soviet emigres--Sergei UZLOV and Boris PALANT. We are
keenly interested in what these two persons have to
say about the young people who graduated from the
French interpreters faculty and proceeded to posts
in Africa, as several of these names are familiar to
us as leads. We are even more interested in background
and assessment data on the three military instructors
TARASENKO, LIPIN, and VOROBEV, who are currently in
Africa and of interest to this branch.

data, we would like answers to the following:
A. What were the career and personal
objectives/goals of these young persons who
accepted assignments in Africa? Were they
aware of the climactic/sociological/anthro-
pological differences/difficulties they would
encounter. in Africa? Did they accept their
assignments primarily to save money? Were
any of them looking upon their African assign-

Union? Had any of them ever mentioned suffering
