Honorable Thomas N. Downing, Chairman
Select Committee on Assassinations
2135 Rayburn House Office Building
Washington, D. C.
Dear Tom:
I am pleased to have the opportunity to recommend
Carole Hansen Amato for a position on the Select Committee
on Assassinations.
I have known Carole since I came to Congress in
1971. She was a member of Congressman John Davis' staff
for seven years and was highly valued by him. Since that
time she has held an executive position with Congressman
Carroll Hubbard and presently works as the legislative
secretary to Congressman Bob Jones.
During her nine years on Capitol Hill, Carole has
repeatedly proven herself as a reliable and competent
worker. She has shown excellent abilities as executive
secretary, press assistant and in a legislative capacity.
I recommend her highly.
If you should need additional information about
Carole, please let me know.
With best regards, I am
Sincerely,
DM:1r2
