Here are a few scattered thoughts on the "Cube" problem.
Cuba is a threat to the security of the United States in two basic ways:

moves by Castro could be immediately by our forces. Similarly we could
intervene in case of Castro military aid to guerilla operations in the Americas.
2. As an ciporter of revolution: There is no doubt that Cuba is being
used as a base for export of the commurist-fidelista revolution. This is
done through the actual supply of funds and technical assistance to insurgent
elements, through widespread and reasonably effective propaganda apparatus
including a news service and radio network and through the use of Cuba as an
example of the alliance between fidclismo and necessary social reform

3. While this means a declining influence of fidelismo over popular
movements; it does not necessarily lessen the importance of Cuban-Soviet-
Chinese material and technical aid to revolutionary movements. It is im-
portant to remember tlist even if Centro were wiped out tomorrow we would
not have solved the problem of communist influence in the Ames. In fact,
most of the greatest danger spots (E.G. Northeast Brasil, Columbia back-

their existence or strength to Castro, but to local and independent leadership.
This danger has been steadily growing, and would confinite to if our only
anti-communist move were to Impak out Castro. These movements will

We should assist these parties

especially in the less progressive countries) through helping them in tech-

U. S. government help should be covert.
Second, the Alianca para el progreso. This program with its emphasis
on social and economic advance is the real hope of preventing a communist
takeover. The Alianza is proceeding about as rapidly as possible given present
organization of effort, and the magnitude of available funds. Both of these
elements are unsatisfactory.
A. Funds: Present plans provide for the allocution of 250-350 million
dollars worth of economic assistance, to Latin America in ficcal 1962. This
is out of a total of 2.4. billion. (Thisļaum does not include the social develop-

2. There are two or three real danger spets (E.g. Dominican Republic
and Haiti) where we should now be developing democratic alternatives to the
present regime
organizing replacement governments. If we do not do this
then the inevitable changes in government may be followed by Castro-type
regimes. When Democratic alternatives are organised we should consider
means of precipitating the fall of Trujillo and Duvalier and possibly Somons.

impossible to realistically determine what alternative courses of action are
open to us,
2. To meet the military threat we can work out defense agreements
with Central American nations along the linos suggested with Professor Borle.
3. Wo should approach the government of Chile to call an Inter-American
arms limitation conference. This conference should deal with methods of
stopping external arms shipments in the content of the over-all limitations
which are desparately needed in Latin America. We chould decide, before
this meeting, whether the risks in an QAS blockade of arms shipments to Cuba
are outweighed by the dangers involved in halting and searching international
shipping.
4. Immediately consult with heads of major nations in Latin America
to see how far they are willing to go in terms of collective action. This chould
be done via a personal emissary. Although we should have a reasonably clear
idoa of what we want to do, this should be a genuine consultation among allies.
All the myriad proposals for OAS action, etc., depend on the reaction of other
Latin nations -- a roaction as yot undetermined.
5. Underlying all these proposals is the feeling that we should not move
quickly in direct action against Cuba. I do not believe that there is any course
of direct action which we can wisely take on the basis of current knowledge and
conditions.

effectively
well-organised as it is
when our overseas operations are
as diffuse and uncoordinated as they are today. The sid program, the
political burcans of State, the USIA, educational exchange, CIA activities
their own way under seperate heads and often
all go, to too great an critent, their own way under separate heals and often
in pursuit of separate goals. I believe that resulting diffusion of effort,
results in great waste of resources and intelligence. We must organize our
non-military overseas operation to reflect our basic objective in Latin
America -- the strengthening of dehocratic Western-oriented nations and
governments so that they have the depocity to resist communist attack in all
its forms. Those who are charged with the responsiblity for achieving this
objective must have control over the instruments which our government
provides. Just as we have seen the need for some centralization of command
in
in fighting hot wars - it is needed for effectively waging a cold war.
This
does not necessally mean a "Chief of Homnisphere Operations"; but at the
very least it means that, within each key country there must be a central op-
erational capacity and authority dith direct lines to the levels of action in
Washington.

:
As indicated by the combined INR/ONE estimate, anti-Castro
activity within Cuba will probably be muted at least for the next
several months. Most individuals whose loyalty is in any way
suspect have been arrested. A recent report from the Swiss
Ambassador indicated that political prisoners now number 100,000.
All internal services will continue to work on a theory of repression
plus undoubtedly swift and brutal penalties. Consequently, it will be
very difficult to carry on any clandestine operations and it is doubtful
that such operations can have any significant impact in weakening
the Castro regime.
In spite of this, evidence is still available that there is opposition
to the regime among individuals still at large and that such opposition
is prepared to undertake action despite the risks involved. Moreover,
there are still agents distributed through most of the six provinces
and communications can still be had either directly or indirectly with
these individuals. At the very least these agents can and will continue
to collect information and to transmit it to the Agency. In addition,
certain of these individuals, plus some additional ones who might be
infiltrated, could attempt to carry out some sabotage. Individual
acts of sabotage are possible with relatively few men and small
amounts of material. Successive acts of sabotage or extensive

sabotage operations are more difficult and inevitably more costly in
terms of loss of men. Nevertheless, it would be possible, starting
in the near future, to attempt limited sabotage with a view to determining
its feasibility and with the hope that gradually an increased program
might be developed.
A capability also exists for types of maritime operations including
infiltration and exfiltration of individuals, landing and caching of arms,
under-water sabotage of shipping and small raider operations. Under
present circumstances it would seem wrong to attempt these except on
a very limited scale and, in all likelihood, raider operations should not
be attempted until more information regarding feasibility has been
obtained.
The Agency also has a small air arm including some transport
aircraft (C-54 and C-46 types) plus attack bomber aircraft (B-26).
Although it is not absolutely certain, there is reason to suppose that
Cuban crews also are available for operational flights. At the moment,
air operations should be substantially eliminated with the possible
exception of supply flights to support opposition elements unable to
survive without such support. Even with respect to such operations,
however, it should be remembered that the percentage of successful
night drops is extremely limited so that the urgency should be great
to justify the risk. B-26 strikes could, of course, be flown against
chosen targets (e.g. refineries, power plants, tire plants) and, if

In addition to the activities described above, propaganda
activities such as radio broadcasts and publication of magazines
and newspapers can be continued independently by the Agency or
in support of Ray or the Revolutionary Council. Moreover, limited
political action operations are possible. As to both propaganda
and political action, however, the amount of effort and the type
of activity undertaken will depend to a large extent on the decisions
with respect to the operations described above. Consequently,
these will be noted here as mere possibilities.

successful, might have the effect of extensive sabotage. In view
of the risks involved, however, and the poor deniability of U.S.
support where aircraft are involved, it is recommended that such
operations be avoided at least for the present.
Manɔlɔ Ray of the MRP has asserted an independent MRP
capability to conduct infiltration, intelligence collection, sabotage
and defection operations into Cuba. He recognizes a need for U.S.
support but is very firm in his desire to operate as independently
as possible of any official U.S. connection. His initial request
is for five boats, some materiel and some money. He admits,
however, that, looking ahead, additional support such as real
estate, some help with training and communications will be required.
He offers to share his information with the U.S. Government, seek
U.S. advice and, at least for a period of time, be willing to operate
with the Revolutionary Council. The Council's views are being
canvassed and Ray has been asked to prepare a prospectus giving
in some detail his needs for U.S. support for the immediate future
and the step-up required over a period of time should his efforts
prove successful.
The Ray proposal should certainly be examined and given support
within reasonable limits if the relationships proposed both with the
Council and with the U.S. are satisfactory.

as soon as possible. Therefore, I will get Ribicoff to expedite the

in order to get these people into jobs, schools, etc. in other parts of

MEMORANDUM OF CONVERSATION WITH:
Dick Bissell
Tracy Barnes
Mr. Bissell agreed that no major decisions concerning covert activities
in Cuba should be made before the President returns from his European
'
trip. However there are a few things he thought should be done immediately:
1. That he revise the internal CIA organization in preparation for possible
covert activities. This means changes bothehere and in Miami.
2. That a small group (30 to 40) Cuban pilots be continued as pilots under
commercial cover in Central America and perhaps one or two American
companies. No commitment should be made to them that they would be
used in future activities. They would be trained as individuals and not
as any group or "movement." This is primarily to keep their skills
alive and to keep them available.
3. He wishes to clean up the Nicaraguan situation. We have left a lot of
Military hardware there as a residue of the Cuban operation. He would
like to pull this equipment out of there, turning some of the B 26's over
to Somoza and allowing some of the Cuban pilots to remain there to train
Nicaraguans in flying these planes. This would be at Somoza's request
and would only be done if he insisted upon it as a re-payment for services
rendered. I stressed that no Americans should be involved in the train-
ing of Nicaraguan pilots.
4. He would like to train a few Cubans as radio operators. They would be
trained as individuals and would not know each other or that any others
were being trained. This amounts to training some individual agents for
possible future use. No commitments would be made to any of the men
trained. It is felt that this much activity is necessary in the next few weeks.
5. In addition, the Agency would like to survey the various potential insur-
rectionary groups which now exist. There are several of these groups,
three or four of which claim to have an underground in Cuba. We should
speak to them. We should tell them we could make absolutely no commit-
ment as to any future activities. However, he would like from them an
assesment of what they thought they could do in the future and
if they
were to be active what help they would require from the United States.

This would enable us to make a judgment as to whether we should en-
gage in covert activity based partly upon this information informa-
tion which would tell us what help in specific terms would be required
and what we could expect from these groups. This has already been
done in the case of Mirona Ray. The groups contacted would include
the Council, the MRP, UNIDAD and MRR.
6. In addition, he was informed that Swan radio could not be used by the
USIA. They are unable to assimilate it into their system. I suggested
that we might try to find a good Latin American group, e. g., The League
of Democratic Parties or the Institute of Political Education run by Jose
Figures, to use it. I said that for the Council to operate the station did
not seem to me to be desirable.
7. I discussed the general situation in Miami and the various newspaper
reports. I pointed out that the KIA agents now in Miami were known to
everyone, including the press, and were the same people who were
identified with pre-invasion activities. Their presence I felt only in-
tensified the rivalry among Cuban groups and served as a focal point of
discontent. I requested that this group be broken up and that to the ex-
tent agents were necessary new people -- people not identified with the
pre-invasion activities should be sent to Miami.
8. It was agreed that no future covert activities should be conducted in
the Miami area and that the groups with whom we dealt should be scattered
in other cities throughout the Southeastern part of the country. I said that
working in Miami was like trying to carry on covert activities in the city
room of a newspaper.
9. We also agreed that Dr. Miro could be informed that we were making
a survey of other Cuban groups but that he should be told nothing more
specific than that.
10. I also referred to the newspaper stories which reported that Batistianos
were being used supported by U.S. -CIA funds. They said this was not
accurate. They said that this would be very carefully looked into and that
the most specific instructions would be given that absolutely no Batistianos
should be supported directly or indirectly by the U.S. government.

For its part, CIA had developed a whole ceries of funcitons poral-
loling already existing functions of the State Department, and of
the Defense Department as well. Today it bas its own political
desks and military staffs; is has in effect its own foreiga service;
it kes (or has had) its own combat forces; it even has its own air
force. Ra annual budget is about tlines that of the State Depart-
mont. The contemporary CIA possesses many of the characteristico
of a state within a state.
II. Doctrina
Though CIA's entopompy developed for historical reasons, it has head
able to endure because there is no doctrine governing our conduct så
clandestine operations, The problem of doctrice for CIA is the extent
to which its various clandestine missions are compatible with a free
and open society.

Rio idlo to argue that, because the Communists can do such-and-ruch,
we are free to do it too. Communiera is a cread nurtured to con-
epiracy and the whole polit of Communist social and political organi-
zation is to make cosepiracy effective. If 'fighting fire with fire' means
contracting the freedoms traditionally enjoyed by Americans in order
to give more freedom to CIA, no one seriously wishes to do that.
I do not feel that we have tried rigorously to think through the limita
which the maintenance of an open society places ca necret activity.
Unill this is done, CIA's role will not be clearly defined and under-
stood. The problem which must be faced is: what port of secret
activity is consistent with the preservation of a free social order?
We must begin, I believe, by accepting the fact that the United States
will continue to be a nation in which politicians will ack questions and
make speeches, zsportere will dig out stories, newspapers will pub-
lish editoriala, individuale, driven by promptings of conscience, will
hurt out things harmful to the state, and so on We do not wish to
change these things and could unt do so without violating the essBC>>CS
of our socioty. These thingo roake up the framework in which CIA

There fellows from thie, I would think, the conclusion that occrct
activities are permissible wolloog so they do not cerrupt the
principles and practices of our society, and that they csoos to bo
perdecible when their effect is to corrupt these principles and
practices.
Łach form of secred activity presents its own problem. Clandestine
intelligence collection has been a traditional function of the national
elate. Its rules and usagen are fairly well established. In the
main, aepionege, if conductail with discretion, should present no
great problem. However, when conducted with an open checkbook
and a broad inandate, even espionage can begin to push against the
limits of secret activity in an open society. I consider later, for
cunmple, the question of the Centrellsd American Scorce (CAS) and
whether the overdoing of CAS is not beginning to harm other activitioa

wonder whether CIA has not done too much of this for the joy of U.
Paramilitary activition create en oven more difficult problem, if
only because the problems of concealinant are so much more difficult.
In general, I could suggest that any secret oparation whese auscesa is

thwarting the impalees and danying the valuse of an open society,
the sickler it becomes, and the more urgent it is that an overwhelming

In short, when confronted with a proposed eperation, me must not only
ask whether the operation le technically fonsible in its own tarme; wa
must ask whether its outeuse requires our open society to be in any

conception of the relationship between operations and intelligence.
The memorandum also cuggsats waye in which serna of these prob-
lems can perhaps be alleviated.
1.
CIA Autonomy
CIA conducta three main forms of secret work; clandesties intelli-
gence collectioni, covert political operations; and paramilitary
activities. It carries on those functions with relative outönorny.
The reasons for the autonom? are nistorical.
When CIA began, the State Depertineat, still thinking too much in
torms of its traditional minstone in foreign affaire, looked on this
new venture with suspicion and renounced the opportunity to seize
firm control of CIA operations. It did not, for øxample, try to
establish any affective system of clearance for CIA activitioa; and
some ambassadors frankly preferred not to know what CIA esa up to
in their countries. After 1953 the fact that the Secretary of State and
the Director of Central Intelligence were brothers further confirmed
CIA's independance from supervision by State Department desks.
In the meantime, CIA grew in sise and power. During the fifties it
began in some areas to cutstrip the State Department in the quality of
ite personnal. Partly because CIA paid higher calaries and even
more perhaps because Allen Dullen gave his people couragoous pro-
tection against McCarthylte attacks, CIA was able to attract and hold
a large number of able and ladopondent miodod men, The more it
added brilliant activicio to its staff, the more momentum its operations
developed, and the greater role it played in the initiation of policy.
By the time that State had begun to be fully aware of the problemis
created by as active and autonomous CIA, it had long since missed
leaz
the chance to establish its orm ultimate authority. While Stato re-
tained a nominal supervision over covert political aperations, this was.
to come degres offbot by CIA's tendency to present a proposed operation
almost as a fait accompli; State never had title to control Greet

It has meant too that the State Department, oftes appriced of an
operation only in its later stagon, is under great pressure to
endorse the operation as already mounted because of the alleged
evil consequences of oxorcistus & rete, I well remember Tom
Mann's remark the day the decision was mada to go ahead on Cuba:

IV. Operations and Intelligence
The relationship between eparations and intelligence raises particu-
larly perplexing questiona, 'Intelligence' includes two segarable
activities: clandestino cellsction; and research, analysis and
oraluation. The first deals with that small portion of row intelli-
gonca procured by ezeret meano (Mr. Dalles estimated in 1947 that
"a proper analysis of the intelligence obtainable by overt,
nermal, and sbovobeard means would supply us with over 60 percent,
I should estimate, of the information required for the guidance of our
national policy"); the second involves the cellation and interpretation
of all forms of intelligence, however obtained and the production of
estimates.
Under the British system, clandestine collection is entrusted to the
Secret Intelligence Service. The research, enalysis and estimating
function is located in the Foreign Office Research Departzzent.
Under the American system, CIA has reopenstbility for both
clandestine collection and research and analysis. The State Depart-
ment's Daresa of Intelligence and Reezarch el69 has rescarch and
analysis responsibilities; but, in practico, CIA key ectablished
control over the machiaevy for producing national entimetos in such
a way as to reduco Siste'a contribution to aubmitting te views to CIA

British experience might not be of valno,
Here I wonder whether the
The actable feature of the
British intelligence system is the determination to keep clandestino
activity under strict Foreign Office contral. This control is achieved
in a number of ways:
a) Secret intelligence Service (MI-6) itself operates under
the direction of the Joint k:telligence Committes, which has a
Foreign Office chairman (until recently Sir Patrick Dean, who
is now the British representative at the UN) and which includes
the Service Intelligence directora end representatives of the
Colonial Office and the Commonwealth Relations Office as well
as the Chief of SIS.
b) basle political warfare directives are originated, not
by SM, but by the Information Research Department in the
Foreign Office, often in consultation with an interdeperimental
Working Group on laternational Communist Fronts, and under
the ultimata central of the Superintending Undar-Secretary of
the Permanent Under-Secretary's Department in the Foreign
Cffice.
c) 315 covert political action campaigns must not only coa-
form to Foreign Office directives but must be cleared with the
appropriate Foreign Office geographical denku.

The argument against incorporating the research and estimate
function in State was made by Dulles in 1947: "For the proper
judging of the situation in any foreign country it is important that
information should be processed by an agency whose duty it is to
weigh facts, and to draw conclusicas from those facts, without
having either the facts or the conclusions warped by the inevitable.
sad even propor prejudices of the men whese daty it is to determine
policy and who, having once determined a policy, are too likely to
be blind to any facts which might tend to prove the policy to be
faulty."
Precisoly the same argument can be used with equal effect against
the incorporation of the research and estimate function in CIA
L. c., if intelligence in too closely connected with operations, then
there committed to a particular operation will tend to select out the
intelligence which validates the operation.
Obviously both argumente conclude lo a case for the establishment of
a fairly independent research and estimate group. But, if the R&E
group is too independert, one runs into the opposite dangers that is,
that neither policy nor operations will be subjected to adequate

covert contribution to any national program designed to bring
about the eventual replacement of the Castro government. This
is correct; and there follows from it (a) that our covert activity
should encourage the spread of the political sentiments within Cuba

example, Ray rather than Batista), and (b) that our covert activity
should harmonize with our basic national policy of rescuing the Cuban

WASHINGTON
July 8, 1961
MEMORANDUM FOR MR. RICHARD GOODWIN
SUBJECT: Cuban Covert Plan
arin
Analysis of this plan shows that it envisages (a) "an island-wide
resistance organization responsive to Agency direction"; "internal
assets under close Agency control and direction"; (b) "support and
guidance to those anti-Castro groups who are revealed to have a
potential for clandestine operations"; and (c) "primary operations
bases" in the US. In short, what is intended is a CIA underground
formed on criteria of operational convenience rather than a Cuban
underground formed on criteria of building political strength sufficient
to overthrow Castro.
Despite the pretense of political impartiality, the effect of these CIA
specifications is obviously to favor those groups most willing to accept
CIA identification and control, and to discriminate against those groups
most eager to control their own operations. I. e., the plan discrimi-
nates in favor of mercenaries, reactionaries, etc., and discriminates
against men of independence and principle. Thus these criteria elimi-
nate the Manuel Ray group; yet I can find nowhere in the documents
any explicit exclusion of pro-Batista people.
Leaving aside the moral merits of this discrimination, the practical
effect is to invest our resources in the people least capable of generating
broad support within Cuba. The Agency fails to confront the key prob-
lem: i. e., that those most capable of rallying popular support against
the Castro regime are going to be more independent, more principled
and perhaps even more radical than the compliant and manageable
types which CIA would prefer for operational purposes.
My recommendation is that you stop this paper in its present form and
demand that it be recast to make political sense. The key is the

that knowledge of the Cuben (poration, flaunted la Miami bars
by any number of low-level agents in the operations branch of CIA,
was denied to even the top officials of the intelligence brauch. The

V. Conclusion.
The argument of this memorandum implies a fairly drastic rearrange❤
mant of our present intelligence set-up, It also implies the capacity
of the State Department to assume command of the situation and to do
in an effective and parpaseful way. If the State Department
present staffed in not capable of assuming effective command, this is
not, in my judgment, an argument against a rational reorganization of
intelligence. It is an orguinant for a drastic overhaul of the State
Department.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT
September 1, 1961
The Cuban Task Force met at the White House on Thursday, August 31.
Present were Under Secretary Ball, Assistant Secretary Woodward, two
members of the ARA Bureau, Dick Bissell, Tracy Barnes and myself.
✓ The following decisions were made:
:
1. We would proceed immediately to discuss with other Carribean govern-
ments the possibility of organizing a Carribean Security Force. This could
be organized on the basis of informal understandings within the framework
of existing treaty arrangements, as a series of new bilateral treaties, or a
formal, multilateral treaty. It was thought that the basis of organization
would depend on the judgment of other Carribean countries as to how they
could accomplish the objective of establishing the force without running
serious internal political risks. The United States, for its part, would pre-
fer the formal multi-lateral arrangement. Such a Carribean Security Force
would have at least four major aspects:
(1) Advance committment to come to the aid of other signatories
threatened by Castro revolutions and, perhaps the designation
of specific units for participation in necessary multi-lateral
actions.
(2) The establishment of a pool of intelligence information con-
cerning subversive activities with provision for exchange of
such information.
1
:
(3) The establishment of a Carribean air and sea patrol to watch
for suspected infiltration of Castro arms or agents.
.t
(3) A training program in combatting subversive tactics, police
organization and procedure, etc.
It was conceded that the substantive aspects of this arrangement could, if
necessary, be achieved informally. However, the decision to seek a more
formal arrangement was primarily arrived at on the basis of internal political
considerations in the United States.

2. It was decided that our public posture toward Cuba should be as quiet as
possible trying to ignore Castro and his island.
1
3. Our covert activities would now be directed toward the destruction of
targets important to the economy, e.g., refineries, plants using U.S. equip-
ment, etc, This would be done within the general framework of covert opera-
tions which is based on the principle that para-military activities ought to
be carried out through Cuban revolutionary groups which have a potential for
establishing an effective political opposition to Castro within Cuba. Within
that principle we will do all we can to identify and suggest targets whose des-
truction will have the maximum economic impact.
4. We will intensify our surveillance of Cuban trade with other countries and
especially U. S. subsidiaries in other countries; and then employ informal
mathods to attempt tundlivert this trade depriving Cuba of markets and
sources of supply. I understand that we have already had a few successes in
this effort.
5. We will establish next week in the State Department a psychological
warfare group. This will be a full-time group of three or four people charged
with the responsibility of assembling all available information on the Sovietiza-
tion of Cuba, repression of human rights, failure of the Cuban economy, etc. .
much of which has been hitherto classified putting this information into
readable, popularized form, and developing methods of disseminating it through
Latin America. Such dissemination would be primarily through USIA channels
but would include feeding it to Latin papers for "exclusive" stories, helping to
prepare scripts for Latin American broadcasts, perhaps a direct mailing list
of intellectuals and government officials to be handled by a front group, etc.
The basic idea is to get this stuff into channels of Latin American communica-
tion, instead of treating it as official U. S. Propaganda. We have selected
someone to head this effort -- Jim O'Donnell of George Ball's office who was
a free-lance magazine writer (including work for the Saturday Evening Post)
for many years and who Ball highly recommends.

n
6. The CIA was asked to come up within the week with a precise, covert
procedure for continuing the below-ground dialogue with the Cuban government.
The object of this dialogue -- to explore the possibility of a split within the
governmental hierarchy of Cuba and to encourage such a split -- was fully de-
tailed in my last memorandum to you. This is an effort to find an operational.

EYES ONLY FOR THE PRESIDENT
(2) His role should be told to only a few people at the very top
with most of the contact work in carrying out his decisions being left to his
deputy. If that deputy is someone already closely identified with the conduct
of Cuban affairs then it would appear as if normal channels are being followed
except that decisive attention would be given to the decisions which came
through those channels. There are probably three or four people who could
fulfill this criterion.
This still leaves a substantial danger of identifying the Attorney General as
the fellow in charge. This danger must be weighed against the increased
effectiveness of an operation under his command.

MEMORANDUM
I believe that the operation should be organized with five staff components:
1. Intelligence collection and evaluation
2. Guerilla and underground
3. Propaganda
4. Economic warfare (exclusive of covert activities within Cuba)
5. Diplomatic relations
Each of these divisions would be headed by someone directly responsible to
you. In addition you would have a deputy who would do the actual contact work
between this operation and the various government agencies involved. He
would be the one identified as the source of orders and directives when direct
contact with the agencies was needed.
sain
He should be from CIA for reasons discussed below. I
would act as Staff Assistant to you. My primary job would be to see that
current questions for decision were presented to you at your morning staff
meetings with the alternatives fully discussed. I would have no direct opera-
tional duties; thus keeping in the back ground.
I have talked to MacNamara and he has promised to supply a topflight guerilla
and underground man, as well as whatever additional personnel we need. I
think this is the best way to handle it. However, it will be necessary to use
the CIA apparatus and agents for this. That is why it will be valuable to assign
a CIA man to you as deputy in order to keep them happy and
deeply involved at the command level. In this way we can probably
avoid an internal struggle between the CIA field operatives and the Defense
command.

As for propaganda, I thought we might ask Tad Szulc to take a leave of absence

Murrow and Dick Bissell.
These people should have a headquarters. It should probably be at the Pentagon
because (a) we might get better security; (b) MacNamara will be easier to work
with in terms of getting whatever staff services, secretarial personnel, etc;
(c) It is a relatively neutral place between State and CIA; (d) you could re-
arrange your schedule to stop in on the way to Justice every morning
perhaps for a breakfast or post-breakfast meeting.
This operation should not be discussed at tomorrow's meeting. Initially only´
George Ball (and Rusk, of course), MacNamara, McCone and Bissell should
know of your participation. When they are named, the five section heads
the the initial organizing work and contact work should

be done through your Deputy and myself. If this subject is discussed tomorrow
then already too many people will know about it,
The first steps are (a) name the section chiefs (b) review with them all current
operations in their field, establish their authority over operations, get nec-
essary staff assistance (on as small as possible basis), and start them to
work; (c) establish the physical headquarters; (d) arrange for financing
presumably coming largely from CIA.
If this meets with your approval I will begin work on the above items with all
final decisions on personnel and other matters subject, of course, to your
approval.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT:
November 1, 1961
I believe that the concept of a "command operation" for Cuba, asdiscussed
with you by the Attorney General, is the only effective way to handle an all-
out attack on the Cuban problem. Since I understand you are favorably dia-
posed toward the idea I will not discuss why the present disorganized and
uncoordinated operation cannot do the job effectively.
The beauty of such an operation over the next few months is that we cannot
lose. If the best happens we will unseat Castro. If not, then at lease we will
emerge with a stronger underground, better propaganda and a far clearer
idea of the dimensions of the problems which affect us.
The question then is who should head this operation. I know of no one current-
ly in Cuban affairs at the State Department who can do it. Nor is it a very
good idea to get the State Department involved in depth in such covert activi-
ties. I do not think it should be centered in the CIA. Even if the CIA can find
someone of sufficient force and stature, one of the major problems will be to
revamp CIA operations and thinking and this will be very hard to do from
the inside.
I believe that the Attorney General would be the most effective commander of
such an operation. Either I ør someone else should be assigned to him as
Deputy for this activity, since he obviously will not be able to devote full time
to it. The one danger here is that he might become too closely identified with
what might not be a successful operation. Indeed, chances of success are very
speculative. There are a few answers to this:
ment
(1) Everyone knowledgeable in these affairs -- in and out of govern-
is aware that the United States is already helping the underground,
The precise manner of aid may be unknown but the fact of aid is common
knowledge. We will be blamed for not winning Cuba back whether or not we
have a "command operation" and whether or not the Attorney General heads it.

The Secretary of Defense
The Director of CIA
The Attorney General
General Taylor
General I.enadale
Richard Goodwin
The following is a summary of the major decisions which have been made in
regard to the Caba Operation,
1. We will go ahead with the discussed project to help Cubs overthrow the com-
munist regime and establish a free Cuba, All available apeets will be directed
to this end as a matter of urgent national priority.
2. The program will be conducted under the general guidance of the Attorney
General, with General Lanedale as his chief of operations,
3. The program will be reviewed in two weeke in order to determine whether
General Lansdale will continue as chief of operations.
4. The NSC 5412 group will be kept informed of activities,
5. The Secretaries of State and Defense and the Director of the Central Intelli-
gence Agency will appoint senter officer's of their department as personal repre-
sentatives to assist the chief of operations as required. These senior officers
should be able to exercise -- either themcalves or through the Secretaries nad
Director -- effective operational control over all aspects of their Department's
operations dealing with Cabn.
6. Knowledge of the existence of this operation should be restricted to the recipiente
of this memorandum, members of the $412 group, and the representatives appetated
by the Secretaries and the Director. Any further dissemination of this knowledge
will be only with the authority of the Secretarios of State or Defense, the Attorney
General, or the Chief of Operations.

The following are some tentative recommendations meant to serve as
basis of discussion:
I would recommend that the Cuban operation be organized in
five componente:
2. Intelligence collection and evaluation
b. Underground and guerilla
c. Propaganda
d. Economic warfare (other than covert activities
Within Cuba)
e. Diplomatic relations
Although these sections will make use of available agency capabilities the
operational authority for each of these aspects of the operation will be in
the hands of the section leader who is responsible to the chairman of the
group. All of these activities will be compartmentalized as much as possible,
Le., only the chairman will be kept completely formed on all aspects of
the operation.
F
The operation should have its physical headquarters in the Department of
Defense, both for maximum security and to detach it as much as possible
from identification as a CIA activity.
The first steps are:
1. Designation of section chiefs;
:
2. A complete survey by each section chief of current
operations in his field;
3. The establishment of control over operations by the
section chief;
4. The expansion of operations where feasible.
Bob Amory should be asked to designate one of his best men to centralize
the intelligence collection and evaluation.
The Defense Department should designate the section chief for underground
and guerilla activities.

If such identification is made, and the operation is not successful, an-
other Cuban failure may be directly traceable to the President. I regard
this as fairly remote in this type of operation but the danger can be de-
creased if the operation is formally headed by someone who is not so
clearly acting at the direct behest of the President. The Attorney General
can give assistance and maintain general supervision on behalf of the President,
working with the Chairman alone rather than extending his contacts to in-
clude all the operation chiefs.

Goodwin Interview of July 16, 1975
Mr. Goodwin was interviewed for a second time
on July 16, 1975. He indicated that he chaired the "Cuba
Task Force" after the Bay of Pigs. Paul Nitze had pre-
viously chaired the group. It was this Cuba Task Force
that suggested the establishment of the Lansdale project.
In this regard, Goodwin noted that Lansdale proved to be
very efficient. Goodwin indicated that he was present
during the conversation between President Kennedy and Tad
Szulc concerning the question of assassinating Castro.
(See Szulc's testimony infra.) He spoke with the President
after that conversation and remembers JFK saying about
assassination: "We can't get into that we'll all be

targets. He noted that Bissell never mentioned anything
to him, Goodwin, about assassination attempts. With regard
to the August 10, 1962, meeting which he attended, Goodwin

We should discuss expansion of propaganda operations with Ed Murrow
and appropriate CIA officers -- not relating it to stepped up operations
in other fields. With these people we should select a single person to be
the propaganda chief, coordinating CIA and USIA operations. I have

Both economic warfare and diplomatic relations should be handled by

relations aspect of this operation under some sort of control so that we
con't involve ourselves in potentially embarrassing situations in the OAS,
e.g. voting to send an investigating committee to Cuba when our operations
are at a height and Fidel has evidence to present of U.S. participation.
The Deputy should be from CIA.

it is inevitable that he will become the focus of another Cuban failure. There
are two types of newsmen involved here. There is a rather large group which
will hear rumors and stories of various kind. There is nothing to be done
about them. There are a few newsmen whose contacts in the Cuban community
are so extensive that they might be able to put together a coherent story. If
any approaches are to be made it should be restricted to these; although they
should never be told we are going to wage an all-out operation. In addition,
as much contact and operational work as possible should be done outside the
Miami area.
Our next step should be to designa te section chiefs, establish their authority
and have them make a complete survey of present operations. This would in-
clude a survey of current covert operations and capacities here and in Miami
(and anywhere else they are going on), as the first task of the Defense Depart-
ment designee with CIA assistance. The physical headquarters should be
established.
Although the Attorney General should maintain a general operational super-
vision, it is probably unwise for him to be the formal chairman of the group
because the risk of identification is fairly high,

6. The principal members of the Special Group felt, after
some discussion, that the CIA variant should be developed further
for consideration at next. Thursday's meeting of the Special Group.
Mr. McCone was asked to stress economic sabotage, and to emphasize
measures to foment a Castro-oldline Communist split. It was
emphasized that any actions under this plan must be so designed as
to avoid major attribution to the U.S.
7. General Lemnitzer told the Group that the Navy does not
wish Guantanamo used as a base for operational activities, as
suggested by CIA. He said that the other Chiefs have not yet given
an opinion on this but he thought that they would agree with the
Navy, as he himself does. The view is that this base is too important
to the U.S. and too vulnerable to Cuban pressure to take the chance
of provoking Cuban reaction. The State representatives agreed with
this view.
8. Mr. Bundy suggested that a hard look be taken at the
possibility of support to selected Cuban exiles on a strictly
"disengaged" basis; in other words, should they be given covert
financial and material support, with the idea of seeing what they
could generate on their own.
9. Mr. Rusk suggested that continued pressure should be
placed on Castro by keeping interest in the prisoner issue alive.
10. Action to be taken:
CIA to prepare a new version of its variant plan, in
accordance with the above-summarized discussion. This should be
ready by Wesnesday, August 15th.

In response to the above, Mr. McCone pointed out that at
the moment the previously-cited frictions between Castro and the
old-line Communists have been resolved in Castro's favor, and no
issue currently exists. There has additionally been at least a

5. The discussion then turned to the objectives of the
MONGOOSE program. Mr. McNamara questioned whether we cannot séparate
the building up of agent assets within Cuba from actions that would
hurt the U.S. in the eyes of world opinion. This led to the sug-
gestion by General Taylor that we should consider changing the
over-all objective from one of overthrowing the Castro regime to one
of causing its visible failure.
In this context Mr. McCone then presented an alternate
plan (called hereafter the "CIA variant") to the stepped-up Course B
described by General Lansdale, which he said had been prepared as a
result of the conclusion that stepped-up B would not in fact result
in the overthrow of Castro. He emphasized that the stepped-up plan
should not be undertaken unless the U.S. is prepared to accept
attributability for the necessary actions, including the eventual
use of U.S. military force. Mr. McCone said that a stepped-up B will
risk inviting an uprising, which might result in a Hungary-type blood
bath if unsupported. Not only would the U.S. be blamed, but there
would also be a high noise level in the press and eventually a situation
would be created which would require intervention.
.
On the other hand, the CIA variant now proposed would, in
Mr. McCone's view, avoid all of these dangers because it would not
invite an uprising. Again he repeated his view that the U.S. might,
however, face a stronger Cuba in the future.

16/15/75
1. Action. None. This memorandum is for your information.
: 2.
Reference is made to our conversation on 13 August 1962,
concerning the memorandum of that date from General Lansdale.
Attached is a copy of this memorandum, excised from which are
four words in the second line of the penultimate paragraph on
page 1.
These four words were "including liquidation of leaders."
3. The question of assassination, particularly of Fidel Castro,
was brought up by Secretary McNamara at the meeting of the
Special Group (Auginented) in Secretary Rusk's office on 10 August.
It was the obvious consensus at that meeting, in answer to a
comment by Mr. Ed Murrow, that this is not a subject which
has been made a matter of official record. I took careful notes on
the comments at this meeting on this point, and the Special Group
(Augmented) is not expecting any written cominents or study on
this point.
A.
Upon receipt of the attached memorandum, I called
Lansdale's office and, in his absence, pointed out to Frank Hand
the inadmissibility and stupidity of putting this type of comment in
writing in such a document. I advised Frank Hand that, as far
as CIA was concerned, we would write no document pertaining to
this and would participate in no open meeting discussing it.
I strongly urged Hand to recommend to Lansdale that he excise
the phrase in question from all copies of this memorandum, in-
cluding those disseminated to State, Defense, and USIA. Shortly
thereafter, Lansdale called back and left the message that
he agreed and that he had done so.

in the meeting after McNamara left. To Goodwin, the idea was not reason+
able even apart from moral objections, for the Bay of Pigs had shown that
Cuba was politically stable; Castro would merely have been replaced
with Raul or with Che Guevara, both worse than Castro. Somewhat later,
Goodwin sat in on an interview Tad Szulc had with Kennedy in which the
President pledged not to kill Castro. Szulc reported that pledge in an
article in Esquire. When he finished his period as Chairman of the Cuba
Task Force, Goodwin wrote a memo recommending that the United States
let Castro alone; anything the United States did to him could only but-
tress his position in Latin America.
1
During his time at the State Department, Goodwin met every
week or so with E. C. King, Chief of the Western Hemisphere Division
of the CIA, and King never mentioned a plan to assassinate Castro. Nor
did Robert Kennedy ever mention such a plan to Goodwin when Goodwin
worked for Kennedy, in 1966 and 1967.
Goodwin did believe, however, that the United States was in-
volved, at least indirectly, in the successful plot on Trujillo's life.
During the Eisenhower Administration, the United States had severed
diplomatic relations with Trujillo and attempted to isolate the Dominican
Republic. There were frequent reports that Trujillo was about to be as-
sassinated, but the assassination never came off. In fact, the govern-
ment was surprised when it occurred. Henry Dearborn, the American Consul
in Santo Domingo, had been charged with staying in contact with anti-
Trujillo forces. Prior to the assassination, he had transferred some

that period he spoke with the President about a Latin American matter
on the average once a day. Goodwin left the White House in the fall of
1962, becoming Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American
Affairs under, first, Robert Woodward and then Edwin Martin. After
working for the Peace Corps, Goodwin was brought back to the White
House by President Johnson, in the spring of 1964, after the Panama
crisis. At that time, however, he did not specialize on Latin America,
instead writing speeches for Johnson. He left the Administration late
in 1965.

Assassinations:
In general, Goodwin had not heard much specific talk of as-
sassination, although it would not have surprised him if it had gone
on.
He mentioned one specific instance in which he had heard talk of
assassinating Castro. After the Bay of Pigs, a Cuba Task Force was
established, first chaired by Paul Nitze and then by Goodwin in his
capacity as White House Staff Officer. At a meeting of the Task Force,
held at the State Department, McNamara suggested "getting rid of Castro,

noted that McCone never made any oration upon the immorality
of assassinating Castro. He remembered the August 10 meet-
ing and said that "assassination was not shot down". When
pressed for details at this point, and after being shown
the Lansdale (8/13/62) and Harvey (8/14/62) memoranda, he
said he wanted to think about the meeting before he made
any more statements about who said and did what. He noted,
however, that in 1966 while in Peru with Robert Kennedy that
Kennedy, in a fleeting retort to a series of questions
about U. S. assassination attempts against Castro, said
"Tell him (the interpreter) I saved his (Castro's) life."
At the conclusion of the interview he turned over
to the Committee various documents related to Cuba which he
had found in his personal papers. Those are appended to

Goodwin Interview of May 27, 1975
During the course of this earlier interview,
Goodwin alluded to the Cuba Task Force. According to the
Committee notes of that interview, the discussion went as
follows:
In general, Goodwin had not heard much
specific talk of assassination, although
it would not have surprised him if it had
gone on. He mentioned one specific in-
stance in which he had heard talk of

The Kennedy Administration decided that left wing democratic
forces in Latin America were the only means of combatting communist
influence and promoting development in the region. That decision was
applied to Chile, and the U.S. switched its support from the conserva-
Goodwin sat in on meetings of the Special Group only
rarely, only if Latin America were the subject of the meeting. As he
remembered it, the proposals that came to the Special Group were general
statements, policy papers, not descriptions of recipients of support or
conduits. In line with the policy, support was given to left democratic
political elements. The U.S. certainly provided assistance to the
Christian Democrats in the 1964 elections, but Goodwin did not know
how much. The figure of $20 million, mentioned by Stern, did not seem
inconceivable to Goodwin.

He contested, however, the assertion that
the Chilean election was the most intensely watched election in Washing-
ton since the 1948 Italian campaign. From his vantage point in the
White House it did not seem so.

Changes during the Johnson Administration:
Johnson cared less about Latin America than had Kennedy--
Johnson was interested only in Mexico--and so knew less about covert
actions in the region. Thomas Mann was left to run Latin American
policy, although the President did become active in the two crises--
Panama and then the Dominican Republic. Goodwin saw a sharp change
in United States' policy under Mann. Mann supported the military and
conservative elements in Latin American societies, and American support

!
the President probably did not know of the gun transfer, but he said
that the assassination and the U.S. role with respect to it would have
come as no surprise to the President. He doubted that the CIA even
would have had to clear the transfer, although a general policy of that
sort might have been passed by the Special Group.
Goodwin reported no other mention of assassinations. In fact,
he said he once heard a CIA man say that assassination was a bad idea
because once started, it never ended. However, an agent in the field
might regard killings of one sort or another as within his mission in
supporting one political faction over another. And of course someone
might have gotten carried away. It was clear from the Bay of Pigs that
the CIA sometimes acted without, or even against, instructions (e.g.
by bringing Batista followers into the Bay of Pigs invasion team). In
general, Latin American work seemed to attract the worst personnel in
all Washington agencies including the CIA.
2. CIA Activities in Brazil:
Goodwin knew little of CIA activities in Brazil. The United
States had strongly backed Quadros and never liked Goulart. In the
period before 1964, the U.S. gave political support to anti-Goulart
factions: followers of Kubitschek and even to the Furtado in the
Brazilian northeast. The U.S. had been involved in Brazilian elections
for many years and presumably spent a good deal in the 1963 congres-
sional elections. On the military side, Walters was brought from Rome
to keep a contact with the Brazilian military. How much further
Walters' activities might have extended Goodwin did not know.

for left democratic reform ended. Goodwin professed himself puzzled
by Johnson's assertion that he had discovered a "murder incorporated"
in the Caribbean.
The only specific instance Johnson ever cited was
Trujillo, yet Johnson had known about the Trujillo assassination from
the very beginning and so could hardly have "discovered" it after he
became President.
5. Covert Operations and Counterinsurgency:
When asked about the ethos surrounding covert actions during
the Kennedy Administration, Goodwin responded that the major emphasis
was counterinsurgency, not covert action. There was certainly no
reluctance to use covert action, but no one believed that American
objectives could be secured through it. Counterinsurgency was some-
thing different. A good deal of money was spent training police through
AID, much more was spent through the Pentagon equipping Latin American
militaries, and there was as well some CIA activity. At that point,
the U.S. really believed that the communists could not get elected to
power and that the threat was subversion. Paramilitary operations
Latin
were considered by the Special Group (counterinsurgency).
American matters were considered there, and in some ways Latin
America was considered a kind of training ground for Southeast Asia.
Goodwin believed that in sum U.S. counterinsurgency efforts made little
difference to the course of events in Latin America. Cuba could not
in any case provide support to guerilla movements in South America
without substantial support from the Soviet Union, and the guerilla
ligen
movements that began had little indigenou's support.

In response to a question about NSAM's, Goodwin noted that
these came out of the Bundy shop, which had little formal staff. Good-
win often wrote these documents. They were both general and, on
occasion, specific, indicating groups to be supported and the like.
Kennedy wanted to know the details of American activities in Latin
America.
6. Goodwin Suggestions:
Goodwin believed it impossible to control the activities of
intelligence organizations without becoming involved in their day-to-
day operations.
What is required is an active Congressional committee,
on the model of the early Joint Atomic Energy Committee, with an active
staff. Once the President is permitted both to decide what is a major
operation, and thus needs to be communicated to Congress, and who to
to
tell, the game is over.
er. Confidence in men will not do; institutional
checks are required.
:
With respect to people to be interviewed, Goodwin mentioned
1
that the Station Chief in Mexico functioned as a kind of regional sub-
director. He also thought we might talk with the FBI person in Puerto
Rico, with Arthur Schlesinger, and with Tad Szulc. In response to a
question, Goodwin indicated that Nixon had been interested in the Bay
of Pigs through Cushman. He thought that Douglas Dillon might know of
that.

or an attempt to kill him would surface you would have the
professional duty to rush to your typewriter and report on this
conversation, even though it was on a personal basis. And
Mr. Goodwin's judgment, and in which I concur, was that
presumably the President would not have floated this issue
with me, and this is really responsive to my own effort to
re-evaluate after the passage of time the President's sincerity
in disclaiming any desire to do so.
My impression at the time and today fourteen years later
is that the President was sincere and serious in affirming his
revulsion to such an idea of assassination.

And then he went on for a few minutes to make the point
how strongly he felt and his brother felt that the United States

to assassination in foreign policy. Again, the

precise quotes and the precise paraphrase I placed in the article
and again I'm paraphrasing from memory now.
And the President added in this context that the reason I
have raised it with you, or words to this effect, is because
I am under very, very strong or powerful pressure from certain
people, whom he did not identify, to authorize an operation
resulting in the assassination of Premier Castro. And I think
we talked about this for a few more minutes, and I think I
repeated the points I made originally and the President said

I might add that several days ago Mr. Goodwin and I had
the opportunity to discuss this and compare our respective
recollections of it, and Mr. Goodwin's recollection is exactly
the same as mine. We discussed this at some length, this
being last week, and the subject being relevant to the current

notes, "I have not attempted to provide you with much

Bissell by Goodwin does not mention any reference by Bissell
to actions against Castro on the assassination front. An
Arthur Schlesinger memorandum of June 30, 1961, to the

memorandum, Schlesinger notes that the CIA is not able to

PROGRAM OF COVERT ACTION FOR THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
1
I. BACKGROUND
A. On 29 December 1960 the Special Group approved a plan of covert
action to support the internal and exiled Dominican dissidents which
involved provision for increased propaganda directed against Trujillo,
and the financial support of selected exiled groups. Additionally this
authority included authorization for CIA to make available to selected
exile groups communications and equipment support necessary for them to
develop a capability to undertake the infiltration of personnel and
equipment into the Dominican Republic. Since none of the exiled groups
had an existing underground organization within the area, it was the
1
Special Group's concept that this delivery capability could be eventually
used to support the plans and activities of the internal opposition with
whom the Agency and the Consulate are currently in contact.
B. On 12 January 1961 the Special Group authorized CIA to make
available to Dominican dissidents a limited supply of small arms and
other materials on the condition that the internal opposition develop
the capability to receive these materials and that the materials be in-
troduced into the Dominican Republic by Dominicans themselves.
II. CURRENT COVERT ACTION OPERATIONS
A. In late January 1961, CIA advised selected internal opposition
leaders that we were prepared to make available to them limited supplies
of arms, communications, equipment, and sabotage materials which they
had repeatedly requested provided they developed a capability to receive

it via air drops or sea infiltration.
To date the internal opposition has
not been able to develop this capability, nor have they been able to
nominate training candidates for code radio operators or saboteurs.
This turn of events is primarily due to the comprehensive nature of
Trujillo's security services, the understandable fear that prevails
throughout the Republic of being caught or suspected of anti-Trujillo
activities, and the fact that the organized internal opposition apparently
consists of only a few individuals with no real underground structure.
CIA has had in the direct custody of its Station in Ciudad Trujillo a
very limited supply of weapons and grenades. In response to the urgent
requests from the internal opposition leaders for personal defense
weapons attendant to their projected efforts to neutralize TRUJILLO,
three (3) 38 Cal revolvers and three (3) carbines with accompanying

recipients have repeatedly requested additional armed support.
The
B. CIA has established working relationships with selected exile
groups. These relationships have taken into account that President
Betancourt of Venezuela has in effect designated former Costa Rican
President Jose Figueres as his emissary and representative to work with
Dominican exile groups. Through Figueres and with the knowledge of
President Betancourt, CIA is providing financial support and technical
guidance to the following activities:

Costa Rica, composed of representatives of the two older exile organizations,

of radio propaganda from Ponce, Puerto Rico, which is under the direction
of Horacio ORNES, Secretary General of Vanguardia Revolucionaria Domini-
cana (VRD). This radio program is heard in the Dominican Republic as
the voice of the ORNES organization.
(3) CIA has refurbished a small yacht belonging to ORNES so as
to give it the capability to deliver small quantities of arms or personnel
into the Dominican Republic. This potential para-military boat capability
has not been utilized to date. It is contemplated that both the ORNES
propaganda program and this limited boat capability will be absorbed by
the exile council now being formed by Figueres.

C. With the knowledge of President Betancourt, and using his govern-
ment as the ostensible source of funds, CIA has provided limited financial
support to a small group of Dominicans who are developing a para-military
capability in Venezuela.
D. CIA has recently re-located Dr. Juan Isidro Jimenez Grullon from
Venezuela to San Juan, Puerto Rico. Jimenez, a physician and university
professor, is a highly respected Dominican exile and enjoys the confidence
of the internal opposition. He is currently working with the Puerto
Rican Government in developing a training program within the structure of
the Puerto Rican Government. The objective of this program is to pro-
vide "on-the-job" training for selected Dominicans in democratic processes
and selected administrative skills. Through Jimenez and a small group
of recently exiled Dominicans who were active in the internal opposition,
CIA is in the process of establishing communication channels to the in-
ternal opposition which will supplement those currently in being through

C. While to date the internal opposition has developed no capability

small number of grenades which are currently in the direct custody of

to the internal opposition for their use in personal defense attendant
to their projected efforts to remove Trujillo can be developed by the

Areas of Inquiry for Goodwin
What, if anything, does Goodwin remember of the August
10, 1962, meeting of the Special Group which he attended?
-- Is this meeting different than the meeting he refers to
in his initial interview where McNamara broached the sub-
ject of assassinating Castro? Or has he simply confused
them and are they one and the same?
}
How does he explain McCone's recollection of having given
an oration on the immorality of assassinating Castro when
it was brought up at the August 10 meeting?
Was McNamara the person who brought up the subject at
that meeting?
What discussion, if any, followed?

THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE
WASHINGTON
May 26, 1961
MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. McGeorge Bundy
The White House
Following up on our discussion of the Dominican Republic at
yesterday's meeting of the Special Group, I am forwarding you a
draft telegram which we would like to send to Henry Dearborn, our
Consul General in Ciudad Trujillo, supplementing the guidance he
will be receiving on the recently approved contingency plans.
The text of this draft telegram has been shown to the Agency and
agreed to by them. I am also forwarding copies of the exchange
with Dearborn leading up to the present, draft telegram to him.
I know it will be difficult for the President to find time
before he leaves to have a look at this but, in view of the situ-
ation in the Dominican Republic, I feel that he should approve it
personally so as to be sure that it is consistent with his views.

PROPOSED TELEGRAM
to US Consul General in
Ciudad Trujillo
FOR DEARBORN FROM DEPARTMENT
1. President has now approved contingency plans somewhat revised subse-
quent your departure and copy will be pouched to you soonest. Hope this will
resolve uncertainties reflected your telegram of May 21 but your comments and
requests for any necessary clarification will be welcomed.
2. Department appreciates valuable work performed by Amb. Farland and your-
self and CAS in developing pro-US attitude among dissident elements. Would hope
this could be retained and strengthened but only if at a cost acceptable from
standpoint US national interest. If price tag for friendship of dissidents,

quantity, places too great strain upon moral position and principles for which
US stands or involves risks which in our considered judgment should not be accepted,
feel sure you will agree we should stand firm.
3. While fully cognizant unique circumstances within Dominican Republic
which precluded normal CAS operation, Department is nonetheless deeply concerned
by degree to which covert activities this case have been forced to deviate from
normal cover and cut-out safeguards with result USG too openly identified with
what should be clandestine activities.
4. Running through entire dilemma has been conflict between two objectives:
(1) To be so associated with removal Trujillo regime as to derive
credit among DR dissidents and liberal elements throughout Latin America;
(2) To disassociate US from any obvious intervention in Dominican
Republic and even more so from any political assassination which might occur.

In Department's considered opinion, former objective cannot, repeat not, easily
override latter. For this reason you should not, repeat not, inform trusted op-
position leaders at this time of draft document which you now hold nor deliver
copy to them. If you believe conditions specified in second and third paras
Department's telegram of May 17 fulfilled, you may advise trusted opposition
leaders that you assume any friendly group seeking to establish authority after
overthrow of Trujillo would promptly declare itself provisional government and
request armed assistance from OAS, US, Venezuela and perhaps other governments.
If reply affirmative, you may advise them orally lines you think such request
should take.
5. In May 19 meeting here with Yaguate and Cibao Department spokesman sought
disabuse them expectation USG acting either through Department or CIA could be
party to any political assassination. At same time assured them this government's
continuing sympathy for legitimate aspirations Dominican people achieve represen-
tative government offering civil rights and guarantees all citizens.
6. In response your comment re covert activities program you should be
aware Department's growing feeling any continuation thereof should be made con-
tingent upon deepening of cover arrangements so as effectively to disassociate USG.
7. In light foregoing suggest further action and to extent feasible substan-
tive conversations with dissidents be withheld pending receipt documents now to
be pouched.

The basic;
policy is to continue to hold open offer of covert help, while

very slight except for verbal encouragement and exchange of
