MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Information Services Staff
FROM
:
Charles A. Briggs
DDO Information Review Officer
Appreciation
SUBJECT
B.il.
1. As you know well, on September 19th, I turn over.
responsibility for release or denial of DDO documents under
the Freedom of Information and Privacy Acts. The experience
has been both frustrating and challenging, epitomizing the
issues in transition from a totally classified past to a new
intelligence environment yet to be defined. The tension in
law between protection of sources and methods and more open
government was apparent, daily, to those involved; good case
law was made as we sought to adhere, to both principles and
to regain, through this process, some credibility for the
Agency.
2. I've tried in the past to convey my appreciation
for the truly magnificent support I got from what is now
the Privacy and Information Action Group, through recommenda-
tions for the Unit Citation subsequently awarded by the DCI,
through QSI's. and promotions, and through personal comment.
All have worked long hard hours and all, those now in PIAG
and those who have left, deserve credit for their professional
efforts in this arena; I want to express my thanks to you for
the assistance your people gave to me as the DDO Information
Review Officer.
3. At the
At the risk of being unfair to some who are more
recent arrivals, I want to express particular and very
personal thanks to Win Brown, Cis Cass, Lou Dube, Mary Felton,
Doris LeBaron, Fred McCann, Karen Rice, Helen Stilson, Jon
Wolfe and Mack Wood,
4. My debt to Fred Randall and Andy Addona has been
made a matter of record on several occasions. Let me just
note here that any supervisor who has had the kind of
qualitative backing that those two gentlemen gave me is
fortunate indeed.
For OPF, Randall, Frederick

MEMORANDUM POR: Frederick C. Randall
SUBJECT
REFERENCE
: Acknowledgment of Evaluation Board Functional Category
1 : Evaluation Board Precepts for Your Grade
1. Based upon an examination of your past assignments and duties,
and after considering likely future assignments, you have been placed
(subject to your signature below) in the functional category W for
Evaluation Board purposes. Precise definitions of this category are
contained in the Evaluation Board precepts for your grade. This place-
ment is made in order that your performance, growth potential, and
career planning may be judged against officers similarly placed pro-
fessionally. YOU ARE URGED TO STUDY THE PRECEPTS AND CONSIDER YOUR OWN
CASE CAREFULLY.
3.

t
"
a.
In general, you should consider the following;
Categories are sharply defined. Competition
is within categories, not between them. Thus,
a weak B/O performance is not strengthened
by reclassifying it as B/OS:
b.
C.
4
A change in category after sustained performance
in a different category may cause a temporary
loss of momentum in your career advancement
until you have demonstrated proficiency in your
new assignment.
A category change should not be initiated for
the period of a temporary, training or rotational
assignment unless a permanent change of career
track will follow.
If you believe that this is not the correct category for
you because the substantive nature of your job more closely approxi-
mates another category or because you have made a permanent change
of career track, please take the matter up through your command channel
to secure the concurrence of your component of assignment or of your
home base component, as appropriate, to a change of your category.
Previously assigned and acknowledged categories will remain in effect
antil a fully executed acknowledgment of change is received by the
Career Management Staff.
4. Please sign and date this notification in the space provided
and return it to your Personnel Evaluation and Management Officer or to
your Personnel Officer.

NARRATIVE COMMENTS
Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective their relationship to overall performance. State
suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training Comment on foreign language competence, 2-required for
current position. Amplify or explain ratings green in Section C to provide best basis for determining future personnel action. Monner of performance of
managerial or supervisory duties and cost consciousness in the use of personnel, spots, equipment and funds, must be commented on, if applicable #
extra space is needed to complete Section 6. amach a separate sheet of paper.
I rate Mr. Randa Fla" done an exceptional job of supervising, motivating,
"outstanding" for Duty Number 1 (his principal responsibility)
for this period. He
training and guiding his group in a remorseless and pressure-laden atmosphere,
requiring both close attention to detail and constant altertness to broad operational
and policy implications. The workload is larger and more complicated than anything
I know of handled by any line operational officer with equivalent grade and responsi
bility. The preceding two fitness reports describe well the nature of the job. It
remains only to be noted that Mr. Randall is the perfect man for the job, combining
a remarkable match of leadership, operational savvy, legal and policy awareness and,
perhaps most important, negotiating ability with both the Agency lawyers and legisla-
tive counsels, and the operating divisions in a bizarre situation that completely
transcends the DO's need-to-know practices (Top Secret and compartmented, bigotted
information must be reviewed) and yet requires the protection of our sources and
methods. Dedicated, discreet, smart, and honest, Mr. Randall is very likely one of
very few DO officers of his grade who could have handled this job from scratch, done
so with virtually flawless output, and created a body of judgments and advice that is
trusted, proven and amounts to de facto 10 policy on how to protect our secrets.

Mr. Randall also has major planning obligations within INS, serving as a
voting member of the PMC and three times a week with Chief, IMS and other (continued)

Fudurich
I agree with the letter ratings and the narrative comments above, particularly those
in paragraph 1 of the narrative.
Mr. Randall is a dedicated, forceful, purposeful, dependable, disciplined officer.
Although his personal preference would have been to do something else, he effectively
manages and leads the Freedom of Information and Privacy Group of IMS--demonstrating
a self reliant style which has brought great credit to work in this area in the DO and
to himself. Mr. Randall's past several fitness reports attested to his talents and
growth in this assignment..

the least active of the four group chiefs in this area,
although he has the inquisitiveness and intellect to contribute
importantly in cross-discipline problems. I find no weakness
here, but Mr. Randall's contributions here do not measure up
comparatively to his exceptional performance in all other areas.
In these other areas, covering duties 3 and 4, Mr.
Randall and his group stimulated, staffed out and justified
three remarkably successful policy changes: a Presidential
statement that sources and methods information need not be
classified to be protected; a DCI policy that DO records ipso
facto are not releasable (despite an OGC opinion to the
contrary), and a policy allowing employees access to their
files without going through the FOIA or Privacy Act folderol.
While not individual accomplishments by Mr. Randall, they
bespeak Erom the leadership and guidance he gave, and they are
typical of the kind of case officer professionalism he has and
we have needed to help protect agents, operations and officers
from exposure. I do think it is sad to have to divert good
DO talent to disclosure law problems; but if we must, then
Mr. Randall's experience and abilities have counted a great
deal in such successes we have had in keeping our secrets.
Mr. Randall's fitness reporting is accurate and fair.

During 1977, Mr. Randall and his group have continued to render
this Directorate outstanding service in an arena where there is little
glory but the constant threat of disaster. In the preparation of
materials for release under FOIA, the Privacy Act or E.O. 11652, the
researcher treads a fine, barely visible line between protection of
operational secrets and revelation of material properly releasable
under the law. He is denied the easy choice of over-protection
because each decision is subject to the scrutiny of the courts, and
the Agency's credibility is on the line each time a judge challenges
a deletion or the denial of a document. (That credibility is
apparently quite high in the courts. We have yet to be reversed in.

NARRATIVE COMMENTS

cont'd
Mr. Randall has expressed to me his concern about what
may be viewed as a drop in his rating from my predecessor's
"Q" to my "S." I have assured him, and assure the reader,
that this change signals no diminution in his performance or
effectiveness, but rather a personal inclination to use
"Outstanding" very rarely. The narrative comments above
should clearly attest to that fact that I view Mr. Randall's
performance as very strong, bordering on Outstanding. The
Agency and the DO have been fortunate to have a man of this
caliber in charge of PIAG.

REVIEWING COMMENTS - cont'd
His
Mr. Randall is one of the key policy makers in this area.
policies have stood the test up to now as our excellent record
in the courts attests.
Having said this, it should be noted that Mr. Randall's
numerous accomplishments are partly because the job was there
to be created. Within the DO he cut the path which is now
followed when handling FOIA matters. He has corrected and
improved upon that path several times over. Thus, the time
is coming for him to be given a change in assignment; an
opportunity to use his managerial and supervisory skills
elsewhere. He will have been in his present assignment three
years in March 1978. One grows stale reviewing, sanitizing
and making judgment calls in the FOIA arena day after day.
Mr. Randall isn't stale yet but we should not wait until he
reaches that stage to give him a new area in which to work.

cursory, and from the beginning there has been a high premium on
both technical accuracy and sound substantive judgment. As Mr.
Randall himself noted in a report on his deputy, we have an
enviable record as far as "flaps" are concerned; in a situation
fraught with danger of inappropriate release of information we
have had only five cases where release has led to embarrassment
out of 7,000 "possibles." Mr. Randall, with typical modesty,
uses the statistic in praise of others; I choose to use it to
praise him. The Group's record to date is nothing short of .
astonishing, and Mr. Randall can take great pride in his team's
accomplishments.
He has built an extremely able and dedicated team, and he
is as quick as anyone I know to ascribe to individual members of
that team credit for actions, ideas or progress. They respond
to his fairness with loyalty and affection, and their morale
in the face of constant harrassment and frustration is testimony
to his leadership.
+
New responsibilities for support to the Office of General
Counsel were added to PIAG's burdens this year. Mr. Randall
opposed the move and argues (and lobbied) intelligently to
preclude it, to no avail. It is to his credit that, having urged.
a different course of action, he set about to ensure that the
'unpopular new function received the same careful attention which
has been the hallmark of PIAG's other work. As a consequence,
our QGC-related efforts, which are very demanding and
time-consuming, have the PIAG stamp of excellence on them.
.
Mr. Randall created the system he manages, and continues
to seek ways to improve upon it. Our move to an automated index
of reviewed and released documents was urged and supported by
Mr. Randall, and he has been equally supportive of a new branch
chief's efforts to restructure our Initial Review process. He
is also quick to see and to comment on the way our efforts
affect larger Agency and government equities, and vice versa.
During this year his responsibilities were broadened by
the addition of our Declassification Review Branch to his Group,
a reflection of our recognition of the inevitable relationship
between scheduled declassification and selective declassification
and release under FOIA/PA/E.O. 11652. This Branch will shortly
be absorbed by the new Records Review Branch of the DDA, but PIAG
will continue to be the focal point for policy formulation on
declassification of DO records.

My qualitative assessment and comments in Fred's February 1976 Fitness
Report apply equally today; in fact, they fall short, in view of the
quantitative and administrative changes of the past year.
•
The news headlines, the new oversight demands, an increasingly
sophisticated FOIA requester group and judiciary, plus a highly organized
hostile element, epitomized by the Center for National Security Studies,
has made the PICG function all the more significant. Cases in litigation
involving DDO materials now number 58 and the appeal pattern is now run-
ning 1:2 (i.e., one appeal for two initial requests, with subsequent
litigation--anticipating deep analysis and Deputy Director-level review)
compared to 1:3 last year. Appeal-level analysis is much more time-
consuming, hence the backlog reduction process suffers; hence, overtime
and fire-fighting remain the norm. Double-encumbered personnel detailing
has raised the on-board PICG total from the 18 stated in last year's FR
to 25.
The managerial task of motivating workers in this continuously
grinding and frustrating environment was harder this year, yet was met
by Fred with the same qualities as those which led his people to write

Mr. Randall supervises the unit responsible for developing the DDO answer to Freedom
of Information Act and Privacy Act requests, both at the initial request level and,
increasingly, at the appeal and litigation levels. His organization is still less
than one year old but has gone through several growth surges as the public reacted
to the past year's publicity about CIA, demanding great amounts of information. Last
March. Randall and his secretary played the role, then the T/O went from 6 to 12 to
its current level of 18. In this period, initial requests received by the Agency
reached nearly 10,000; appeals number about 300, and there are currently 31 cases in
litigation, the DDO being involved in 27. Much overtime is the norm, in a backlogged,
firefighting environment.
This has been uncharted sailing. Years of conditioning in sources and methods pro-
tection made analysis of DDO materials for release agonizing. The Watergate and
Congressional investigation experience produced over-reaction tendencies in the
Agency. As the individual responsible for releasing or denying DDO materials in the
first instance, and subsequently defending DDO decisions in affidavits and adversarial
oral depositions, I not only attest to the excellence of Mr. Randall's analysis and
recommendations, but gratefully thank those who brought him to the job in the first
instance. Frustrating and often demoralizing as his job is, he does it with real

both to me and to SA/DDO/O. Additional administrative
complexity results from my having changed staffs, while
being asked to retain the DDO Information Review Officer
function. Hence, split daily support to me as well as
periodic support to SA/DDO/O, poses a potentially ticklish
situation with Fred's organizational supervisor who is

well.
Finally, Fred has persistently tried to convince others
that there is a critical need for a centralized capability
to assess the total Agency impact of decentralized informa-
tion release, whether to FOIA, congressional, judicial,
news media or other non-intelligence requesters. His
efforts are about to bear fruit, since this will be an EAG
agenda item next month.
Whether it's bringing his professional overseas background
to bear on the analysis for release process; protecting
sources and methods in the now "open sunshine" context;
trying to save resources and ensure efficient procedures;
deal effectively and impressively with senior officers in
this Agency and others; or supervise a collection of
dedicated and hardworking people, firmly but with good
humor and understanding, Fred has done an Outstanding job.
He will be very hard to replace, and yet, he should move on.
No?

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Services Staff
SUBJECT:
Fred Randall, C/DDO/PIC
1. This memorandum. is intended to state what we,
the staff of DDO/PIC, think of our Chief, Mr. Fred
Randall. Mr. Randall is not aware of this memorandum.
▸
=
2. We believe he is outstanding as a manager and
fellow worker! His sensitive understanding of human
relationships is balanced by a no-nonsense firmness to
get the job done. Using extraordinary patience, brains,
tact, and diplomacy, along with long hours and weekend
time, he has set an example for his entire staff. Mr.
Randall's deep knowledge of operations, his grasp of
the implications of past operations on current activity,
his determination to protect the Agency and the DDO from
the devastating impact of unwarranted and unauthorized
release of information, and his judgement of the fine line.
between what should and should not be released under
appropriate law and policy, have formed a major line of
protection for the USG and the Agency.
.3.
He has not hesitated to make decisions, nor to
disagree when he felt disagreement warranted.
A strong
aversion to pyramid building has underlined his cost-
consciousness to get the most done with the least amount
of expenditures. Yet, his determination and firmness are
based upon an open, objective mind, willing to listen to
different views, and to change his position if he is
convinced of the need for change.
A.
:
His strong desire to aid employees in career
development is re-inforced by concrete actions, positive
suggestions, defined tasks, and frequent checks to assess
the quality and quantity of work product.

5. The nature of the task assigned to DDO/PIC
includes the word by word review of thousands of pages
of documents. The impact on the Agency, and the USG,
of unauthorized disclosure of secrets, adds to the weight
of constant decision making, and to the strain and tension
of defending a crucial perimeter. And this perimeter is
under an almost daily attack of erupting crises. Mr.
Randall's dedication and superior ability in handling an
onerous, difficult, and complex job, filled with frustra-
tions that would dismay and discourage others, has been
truly outstanding.
6. Mr. Randall has had his finger in the dike for
an incredibly long time. He has been operating in a
hazardous, high pressure environment, fraught with
penalties if he does not make the right decisions, and
little recognized when he does. Yet, his common sense
decisions have been accepted, and have become policy--
policy that ordinarily is made by very senior super-grade-
officers of the Agency. An assignment in DDO/PIC can
burn out rapidly many competent individuals. Fred
Randall is still going strong, and continuing to do an
outstanding job!

professionalism and seems to have been made for it. As I said in a
memo last October which resulted in a QSI for him, in spite of the
ambiguity of the guidelines, constant pressure of short deadlines,
very large volume of work and cultural trauma generated by the Acts,
his performance has been Outstanding.
Earlier fitness reports, in a different context, stated or
implied some reservation about his energy or initiative or independent
action. I can't imagine that we're talking about the same man. Close
to 95% of the mass of Agency FOIA receipts have involved the DDO.
know all of the persons involved in other directorates and said, only
6 months into this year, that Fred was head and shoulders above the
others, combining professionalism, tact, persuasiveness, analytic
skills, tough-mindedness and pragmatism in sources and methods protection.
He suggested policy, strongly influenced implementation, and debated,
usually successfully, with the lawyers, with DDO branch, division and
staff chiefs, with other Agency contacts and others above his current
grade level--all with a sustaining sense of humor.
As to management of his unit: he has consistently resisted empire-
building opportunities, trying to keep his staff small. When growth was
inevitable, he concentrated on quality in personnel selected for this
atypical DDO work rather than accepting the short fix to the statistical
backlog problem because routine or "passable" effort is not good enough
in litigation. The best reflection of his managerial ability can be
seen in an unsolicited testimony from his staff which I have attached
to this report to make it a part of the official record; it is the first
of its kind to come to my attention in my 23 plus years in the Agency.
(If some jaded cynics in these days of non-credibility doubt the
spontaneity and true feeling of Mr. Randall's staff in this action,
and one or two of my staff have, I can only feel sad for them.
is a breath of fresh air to me.)
This
Randall has made a singularly impressive shift in direction,
has changed career category and, in my judgment, has unqualifiedly
demonstrated his command of the position he holds. I have recommended
recognition of that fact.

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT
SUBJECT: Mr. Frederick C. Randall, GS-14/7
:

:
"
1. This report is submitted as part of a package suggesting that
Mr. Randall be awarded a QSI for his performance since becoming the
DDO Freedom of Information Officer in February of this year. In this
context, it is not appropriate that he see and sign this memorandum,
since I want this to be a surprise. Nor, it seems, is it necessary
to have a Reviewing Official for this interim report; the DDO has
suggested, in commenting on my out-of-cycle recommendation of 8 August, 75
for Mr. Randall's promotion, that a memorandum be submitted recommending
a QSI at this time.
2. I consider Mr. Randall's performance as DDO/FIO (now DDO/PIC, for
Privacy Act and FOIA Coordinator) to be Outstanding. As I have said
elsewhere, he is, in my view, the most impressive of all the Agency FIO's.
combining DDO professionalism, tact, persuasiveness, analytic skills and
an informed, tough-minded approach toward sources and methods protection.
I have received considerable laudatory comment about his work from OGC,
OLC, O/DDA and within the DO.
3. From a one-man operation with secretary, the FOIA activity expanded
in four months to an approved T/O of 7, with a pending request for 5 more,
and the possibility of further increases depending on public reaction to the
Privacy Act and the amount of litigation that develops. Fred has done an
excellent job of selecting his staff for what is an often frantic, frustrating
and long-houred environment; he also manages them well, with humor and
compassion and with high analysis and output standards. He is conscious of
cost, particularly in human effort, in this exercise and of the need for
balance in the application of secrecy criteria in today's environment.
am, obviously, impressed and pleased with his assistance, and feel
comfortably supported by his group's efforts in avoiding or preparing for
litigation actions in FOIA and Privacy Act cases.

during the rating period. Whereas I had indicated in his last fitness
report a need for him to be more demanding in challenging faulty pro-
posals or resolving problems which come to him at his Branch Chief
level, he now exerts a good degree of initiative in independent action
and offers good completed staff work to the Division Chief level for
scrutiny. Mr. Randall's branch encompasses four (4) busy Bases
(Atlanta, Boston, Los Angeles and San Francisco). He keeps effectively
abreast of the operational developments coming out of each Base and
represents this Division very persuasively in obtaining good guidance
messages going back out to the Bases. He has also kept himself well
informed on the Management by Objectives targets assigned to each of
his Bases where a total of about forty (40) personnel are assigned, and
has been strong in supporting his Bases' efforts to achieve these.
objectives.
Mr. Randall has matured nicely as a manager these past months
and is on top of the many administrative, personnel and operational
support problems which are of a frequently recurring nature in our type
operational activity. He is also a good team player, has the best
interests of this Division at heart, and gives thoroughly of himself in his
job. He has worked hard in bringing himself up to his present level of
performance which I appraise as an unqualified "Strong".

REVIEWING OFFICIALS COMMENTS (Frederick C. Randall)
I concur generally with the comments of the rating officer.
I believe Mr. Randall has shown improvement in his handling of his
Branch Chief responsibilities. I agree that he has shown greater
initiative in this reporting period than in the previous ones, however,
I would still like to see a somewhat greater and quicker recognition
on Mr. Randall's part of operational problem areas. Granted that this
is a talent that is frequently hard to develop, it is nonetheless, essential
for all Branch Chiefs in this Division to achieve a high degree of
operational perspicacity. Mr. Randall has the ability and needs only
additional experience to improve his focus on the operational targeting
efforts of his respective Bases. He is a thoughtful and considerate
supervisor, respected by his subordinates and he represents the Division
very well indeed. Mr. Randall's career would be enhanced were he in
a position to accept a field assignment which would get him into direct
operational contact, i. e., recruiting and handling agents. Unfortunately,
for family medical reasons he will apparently be confined to the
Headquarters area for an indefinite period. On balance, I consider him
to be a good Branch Chief who willingly works long hours and does his
job well.

Mr. Randall has served under me for slightly more than three
months and had just taken over his new position duties when
I arrived for duty in this Division. During this brief
period, however, he has displayed considerable dedication
and interest in applying himself to his newly assigned tasks
as Chief of one of our three operating branches. This branch
which comprises Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boston and Atlanta
Bases, is shaping up nicely thus far under this supervision,
and appears well organized to support the four bases in the
months ahead. He could at times be a bit more demanding in
challenging some aspects of proposals or problems at the
Branch level instead of allowing them to pass on up to the
Division Chief level for decision, but it is hoped that he
will gradually develop his style in this direction as he
becomes more accustomed to his expanded responsibilities as

Frederick Randall
I
Branch Chief. The thorough test of his managerial skills,
however, will occur in this upcoming period when all the
Bases in his Branch become operationally active on a broad
front and will require a continuing high quality of super-
vision, guidance and support from the Branch Chief's office.
I would rate his performance to date as an overall "Strong".

3. Reviewing Official's Comments:
23 November 73
Date
I concur generally with the above rating. I also observed in the
early days of Mr. Randall's assignment as Branch Chief, that his per-
formance could certainly have been stronger. It took him somewhat
longer than I had anticipated to really take charge of his Branch. However,
I feel that as he has continued in this assigninent he has made very definite
progress. He is now generally well informed on the operational activities
taking place in his area and has begun to exercise a greater degree of
initiative and aggressiveness in handling the operational matters that cross
his desk. Had I been the rating officer I probably would have given Mr.
Randall a somewhat lower, more qualified "Strong" rating. If he continues
to improve in the months ahead as he has in the past several, I believe he
can earn an unqualified "Strong" rating for this performance.

In the less than six months since my preparation of the previous report on
Mr. Randall, his overall performance, has continued strong. He has effectively
continued to provide the day-to-day operational support for the FR Bases in Los
Angeles and San Francisco and the two (soon to be three) singleton officers in
the Northwest, Colorado and Arizona. The level and complexity of the operational
support and guidance which he has provided with skill, sensitivity and humanness
has continued uniformly high.
Mr. Randall has again effectively trained a new Intelligence Analyst with no
loss of efficiency or responsiveness to the ever-increasing field requirements.
Mr. Randall has been under my supervision for 28. months as the San Francisco/
Los Angeles Desk officer and has continued successfully to meet the challenges
of increased responsibility. It is now planned to appoint him as Branch Chief to
be responsible for the Bases in Boston and Atlanta as well as Los Angeles and
San Francisco. The increase in complexity of this new assignment for him will.
be heightened by the assignment of additional operational personnel in three of his
four Bases, which will materially add to the demanding workload of his Branch.
We are confident he will be able to meet the challenge of these added responsibilities

Mr. Randall continues to exercise the responsibility of providing the`day-to-
day operational support for the FR Bases in Los Angeles and San Francisco. The
comments that were made in the previous fitness report bear repetition. In any
other Division the backstopping of two Bases, which are Stations in all but name,
would involve at least an entire branch and all the supervisory responsibility that
such support entails rather than a single officer with an Intelligence Analyst. Mr.
Randall does all of this and has continued to do it well. During the year both Bases
have increased substantially in size and in degree and complexity of the operational
activities there. He has supported both Bases exceptionally well.
In addition to carrying on the full-time responsibility for both Bases he has
continued to demonstrate a willingness and a sensitivity to increase the offective-
ness of his Intelligence Analyst, who has now gone on to a sensitive SB position
with additional responsibility, by careful tutorial training and guidance. He has
then been called upon to train a second Intelligence Analyst quickly and did so
while maintaining a high degree of responsiveness to the continued demands of
the two Bases.
Mr. Randall continued to turn in a "Strong" performance and is held in high

•
As a final statement, it is my opinion that Mr. Randall does not have
the requisite GS-14 convertibility from his present desk assignment to
that of an active field case officer charged with the recruitment of agents.
This is not atated in denigration of Mr. Randall for there is clearly a
need and a place for the type of talents he possesses, I think we have
found that place in the job that he is now performing.

Section C, outsch a separate sheet of paper,
Mr. Randall has the responsibility of providing the day to day operational
support to FR Bases in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Both bases have in-
creased substantially in size during the past year to where there are presently
six senior case officers and an intelligence assistant in Los Angeles and ten
senior case officers and an intelligence analyst in San Francisco all generating
significant operational activity requiring substantive guidance, management and
organizational initiative of the highest order. In any other Division the back-
stopping of an element of this size and complexity would involve an entire branch
and all the supervisory responsibility that goes with it rather than a single officer
and an intelligence analyst. In the FR Division the decision was made to keep the
Headquarters complement small and to do a job with carefully selected experienced
and skilled senior operations officers who, based on their own field and personal
experience, are able to press the right buttons to evoke appropriate responses
from the various area divisions and staffs and to provide practical guidance on
their own.
In exercising this function, Mr. Randall has continued to demonstrate those
`critical qualities of energy, loyalty and dedication. He cares. He is concerned
with end results as well as the means by which the end is reached, He is

COMMENTS OF ARV:ERING OFFICIAL
I think the narrative portion of the above rating is a thoughtful and accurate
account of a conscientious officer's performance. However, I believe the letter
grades are a little on the high side as I fecla precise letter description would ba
in the overall "S-" or "P+" category. Since I have great confidence in the rating
officer, I am prepared to defer to his judgment as stated above, I think it might
be noted that Mr. Randall has indeed come along very nicely in his present
assignment. I believe he is eminently well qualified to perform his current job.
I believe that his talents and experience are better utilized in his current assign-
ment then they would be in a more direct operational, i.e., agent handling and

This is Mr. Randall's first fitness report for a Headquarters assignment
following nearly 9 years in the field, of which over 4 years were at the Washington
Base. Even with this field background of operational activity in the USA, Subject
finds himself faced with a different kind of target situation than he had at the
Washington Base. Since the Los Angeles and San Francisco Bases have little in
terms of a large PCS diplomatic community ( as compared with Washington), their
targetting for the most part is aimed at those foreign nationals, designated as
important targets by the area divisions, who are graduate students in US universities.
The reporting period (of 3 1/2 months) is too short a time to give a fair evalua-
tion of Subject's performance. This much can be said. Subject has undertaken
his responsibilities with enthusiasm and a willingness to learn. He has made mia-
takes but these were "par for the course" and none that were not retriyable and
correctable. Given the way he has jumped into the fray, I would characterize his
overall performance as evincing exceptional proficiency. He is conscious of and
maintains a good balance in the outgo of funds for field operational purposes.
He is a good supervisor. He has more to absorb and digest in terms of the
myriad problems facing an officer giving total support to two Bases. He has
to date made an auspicious beginning. As a desk officer, agent recruitment is
not part of his duties.

Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective, their relationship to

Mr. Randall continues to view his responsibilities with enthusiasm and serious con-
cern. Given the complexities of dealing with every area division and staff within
DDP on cover matters, academic approvals, targetting against foreign nationals,
recruitment of support assets, secure operational approaches, etc. --I would
characterize his overall performance as evincing exceptional proficiency. This was
accomplished in a period which saw both Bases increase their striking power numeri-
cally rather significantly. In the ultimate, the real test of performance is in re-
cruitment of foreign nationals. While recruitment is not part of Mr. Randall's duties
there is no doubt that his support of the two Bases contributed to the highest record
of recruitment that these Bases had as compared to any other year. At the same time,
he consciously maintained an excellent balance in the outgo of funds for operational
purposes. He is held in high regard by both Base Chiefs. Since much of the routine
desk work is done by his Intel Assistant, it is a tribute to his supervisory capability
that this service maintains a high rate of efficiency despite the significant increase in
work, and the fact that during this period there were three different intel assistants.
Since the supervisor began phasing out of his job for several months prior to 31 March,
a rather conscious decision was made to have Mr. Randall in fact assume some of
the responsibility of the Branch Chief. Not only has he taken these added tasks
willingly and with the confidence of DO's management, but he has performed
superbly.

However, I feel that it is somewhat overstated. Specifically, I would
not rate his performance of Duty No. 1 as "outstanding", rather'I
would rate it "strong". I consider Mr. Randall a capable officer, but
feel hia overall performance falls somewhere on the border of a "low
strong" and a "high proficient". Let me hasten to add that I am fully
satisfied with Mr. Randall's performance in his present assignment,

This case officer is intelligent and articulate, and is
capable of dealing with oquanimity with intellectuals, particularly
academicians. He has had sufficient experience in field assignments
to have developed an area of expertise. His operational and intelli-
gence reporting is organized, coherent and thorough.
He was one of the few officers within the Base who made agent
recruitments during the period. Ono of these was essentially routine,
through no fault of the rated officer, but in another case the
officer skillfully used an imaginative' cover, as he also did in
a third recruitment case which had the additional complexity of
WODISH involvement. In all these cases the officer illustrated his
ability to plan, organize and carry through an operation to a.
successful.conclusion.
$
If I were to fault, this officer I would say that he is not
ho
essentially an activist, and that, ho lacks the force to be a
notable recruiter. Conversely he does possess the sense of caution
which slows down recruitment but also saves mistakes.

I am somewhat surprised that the rater gives an overall rating of “Þ"
for Subject's performance when in the rater's own words "he was one of the
few officers within the Base who made agent recruitments." In another recent
fitness report on another officer who has since been transferred and whose
activities for the year have been rather minimal, i, e., no recruitments and
rather marginal agent handling, the rater gave him the overall rating of "S".
Apparently the rater prefer a "social animal," The fact remains that Subject,
while giving the outward Impression of being low-key was indeed an active and
thorough case officer and was given special assignments because of his
_dependibility and capabilition would have giren Salecta higher rating.

Subject is the FE referent for the Bage and, as such, has
the responsibility for coordinating all work against the FE
targets as well as himself handling the bulk of operational
Eactivity in this category. In addition, as is true of all
officers at the Base, he is responsible for contacting and
developing American and foreign nationals in the Washington area
with the capability of producing intelligence and operational
information of interest to WOFIRM. His forte continues to be
the exploitation of existing assets rather than the recruitment
of new agents, particularly among foreign nationals.
foreign nationals. However,
the lack of a good access cover has hampered his recruitment
activity against foreign nationals to some extent. He performs
his supervisory functions well. He has asked for transfer to
WCROMP and the rating officer endorses this request, feeling
that Subject's high degree of expertise in the FE area would well
qualify him for work of a substantive nature in the WOROMP.
Subject is cost conscious and his accounting for official funds
is prompt and accurate. No training is contemplated or recommended
at this time.

Subject is the FE "referent" for the Washington Base and, as
such, has the responsibility for coordinating; all work against the
FE targets as well as himself handling the bulk of operational
activity in this category. In addition, as is true of all officers
at the Base, he is responsible for contacting and developing American
and foreign nationals in the Washington area with the capability
of producing operational and intelligence information on other areas
of priority interest to WOFIRM. His forte continues to be the
exploitation of existing assets rather than the recruitment of new
agents, particularly among foreign nationals. He writes well and
is orderly and professional in his approach to operations. His,
work on the highly involved and sensitive WUWORTHY case is cited
in this regard. Although he continues to feel a bit unsure of
himself in operational areas other than FE (to a degree not warranted
by his performance, as the WUWORTHY case shows) he is improving in
this regard and is on his way to bringing his operational activity
in other areas up to the level of his performance on Asian targets.
He performs his supervisory functions well. He is very cost
conscious and his accounting for official funds is prompt and
accurate. No particular training is contemplated or recommended
at this time.

Subject has Washington Base responsibility Joe Whislations directed
against FE Division targets. He continues to do an excellent job of
exploiting his foreign and domestic contacts for operational and
intelligence purposes. His patience, skill and sophistication in the
handling of sensitive oriental agents and agent candidates has meant
a continual increase in the calibre of Base operations against these
targets. He has developed a Burmese official (WUTHAL) to the point
of giving useful information on his Embassy and his Government's
intentions at a time when it is difficult to have any contact with
Burmese at all. The intelligence reporting from his other agents--
particularly WUFLY and WUSHARK--has been impressive and he has talked.
WUSHARK into attempting to get a posting to Peking.
=
He has, on his own, developed a solid academic cover and has
used it to advantage on occasions when his official cover was not
appropriate. He is very cost conscious and his handling of confidential
funds is characterized by good judgement and prompt accountings. He
has excellent working relations with his colleagues at the Base and
in Headquarters.

Subject has U.S. Station responsibility for Far Eastern operations. Since
submission of the "Memorandum in Lieu of Fitness Report At end of 1965,
Subject has worked well into the local operational environment and is doing
an excellent job of initiating exploitable contacts. A previously unproduc-
tive Station agent (WUALLOY/1) has improved his reporting and his access
since Subject has taken him over and was the Station's only agent at the
Havana Tri-Continent Conference. Subject's handling of a potential pene-
tration operation against the Indonesian Embassy showed balanced judgement
and a good appreciation of the CE and FI factors involved. His knowledge
of Far Eastern politics, geography and contemporary history is encyclopedic
and his handling of orientals in the USA confirms the high marks given him
by FE supervisors in earlier reports. He has begun to use his cover in
initiating new contacts within the diplomatic community as well as con-
tinuing to assess several WUENVOY candidates within the academic community.
His handling of confidential funds is characterized by good judgement and
prompt accountings. He has excellent working relations with his colleagues
at the Station and in Headquarters.
No training is contemplated at this time beyond the Clandestine Services
Review Course which Subject will take in March 1966.

Subject has US Station responsibility for Far Eastern operations.
He continues to do an excellent job of exploiting his foreign and
American contacts for operational and intelligence objectives. His
handling of a difficult penetration agent in the Indonesian Embassy
(HASHARK) has received high praise in formal traffic from Headquarters.
A previously unproductive Station agent (WUALLOY/1) has improved his
reporting and his access since Subject has taken him over, and was
the Station's only agent at the Havana Tri-Continent Conference.
Subject's handling of a potential penetration operation against the
Indonesian Embassy showed balanced judgment and a good appreciation-
of the CE and FI factors involved. His knowledge of Far Eastern
politics, geography and contemporary history is encyclopedic, and
his handling of orientals in the USA confirms the high marks given
him by FE supervisors in earlier reports. He has begun to use his
cover in initiating new contacts within the diplomatic community,
as well as continuing to assess several WUENVOY candidates within
the academic community. His handling of confidential funds is
characterised by good judgment and prompt accountings. He has
excellent working relations with his colleagues at the Station and
in Headquarters.

Subject returned to the U.S. in August 1955, but did not begin sub-
stantive work in the Non-Orbit Group at the Station until late September
1965. Much of the time since his arrival has been spent on becoming
acquainted with the work of the Station and in casing the operational
possibilities among the FE Division targets in Washington. We, accordingly,
prefer to delay until April 1966 submission of a formal Fitness Report
which, hopefully, will give a more precise and meaningful evaluation of
his performance than is now possible.

dable inroads into the Indonesian student community and we hope this he
will also soon get in come solid work on the Indonesian and Burmose
diplomatic targets.
We note that Fitness Reports submitted on Subject just before his
departure from Tokyo gave him high marks for his operational support work
in Japan and regrettel that the situation in Tokyo did not permit him to
be given as much active operational work as he wished. He will certainly

have the opportunity for aggressive agent operations in Washington, and
is aware that this activity will not be limited to targets of interest
to FE Division, but will give him the chance to participate actively in
the planning and execution of operations directed at the recruitment
and/or handling of other priority targets as well.
No training is recommended at this time beyond the Clandestine
Service Review Course which Subject will take in March 1966.
Subject exercises good judgement in his handling of official funds
and his accountings are prompt.
He gets along well with his colleagues at the Station and in
Headquarters.

This officer has brought to bear on his current assignment his varied organi-
zation experiences in a manner which brings credit to himself as well as to the
organization. His unstinting giving of himself is an outstanding attribute. The
trials and tribulations of PERAMPART in an area traditionally hostile to the whole
concept have made his assignment particularly challenging, always difficult, and.
infrequently satisfying; but he sticks to it with firm determination.
His super-
visory role of our Central Registry frequently catches him in the cross currents of
opposing interests and priorities but he successfully calms such troubled waters.
While a part of his PERAMPART activities this officer's supervision of the CCFJ, an
intelligence community pooled activity for agent checks, has been excellent. Finally,
his task under SD 4 is largely a handholding one but one which requires large amounts
of tact, patience, and goodwill. There is no other Station officer performing
comparable duties with whom this officer can be compared.

16 MAR 1967
Approved Ly CS Cercer
Service Pomal
24 MAY
Chairman, Clandestine Services
Career Service, Section A
Frederick C. RANDALL, Recommendation for
Promotion to GS-14.
1. It is recommended that Frederick C. Randall be
promoted from GS-13 to GS-14. Subject is 40 years old
and began his Agency career in 1951. He has been a GS-13
since 1958. He entered on duty at the Washington Base
(then Washington Station) in August 1965,
2. Subject is responsible for Washington Base
operational activity directed against FE Division targets.
He replaced one GS-14 officer and one GS-13 officer who
shared this responsibility before Subject's arrival.
Since Subject's EOD at the Base, the tempo and quality of
operations against FE targets has increased greatly. During
the period before Sukarno's overthrow in October 1966,
positive intelligence reporting from two agents handled
by Subject (WUSHARK and WUFLY) made significant contributions
to WOFACT assessments of Indonesian events. Reporting in
recent months continues to be useful to Djakarta and, in
the case of WUSHARK, Subject has brought an agent to the
point of being willing to request posting to Peking to cover
FE targets there. Subject has an encyclopedic knowledge
of Asian history and current events, and his handling of
Asian agents has shown excellent sophistication, perception
and maturity. He has been systematic in his exploitation
of the total' capabilities of his agents and contacts and
has not been content to limit himself to procurement of
positive or operational intelligence from their own embassies
or countries. At the request of the local FBI office,
Subject has guided one of his agents (WUFLY) into a close
relationship with a Soviet Bloc intelligence officer and
the FBI has expressed its appreciation for Subject's pro-
fessional handling of this and other cases in which he has

Finally, let me make special note of the contributions

records requests. Their particular expertise was a welcome
addition to the staff support received.

been involved on its behalf. Subject has an excellent CE
mind and á healthy scepticism at all stages of any opera-
tional situation. His analysis and handling of the WUAPEX
case is cited by way of demonstration of his willingness
and ability to probe in painstaking fashion before commit-
ting the Agency; his careful debriefing and interrogation
of WUAPEX were key factors in the ultimate decision not to
plunge ahead on this controversial case. His poise and
tact in the development of the sensitive WUTHAL operation
has resulted in Agency acquisition of a well-placed agent
within the Burmese Embassy at a time when contacts with
official Burmese are extremely difficult. Subject is
officially registered in the American University Graduate
School and makes excellent use of the academic cover thus
acquired to supplement his official cover when such is
deemed advisable (as in the WUTHAL case).
-
3. An examination of Subject's file shows that he
has been recommended for promotion to GS-14 a total of
seven times (four by FE Division and, with this request,
three times by DO Division). Aside from the fact that he
is definitely performing at the GS-14 level, we believe
this to be an important factor to be considered in the
present promotion request.

MEMORANDUM FOR:
SUBJECT
Chairman, Clandestine Services
Career Service, Section A
Frederick C. RANDALL, Recommendation
for Promotion to GS-14
555
:
=
1. It is recommended that Frederick C. Randall be
promoted from GS-13 to GS-14. Subject is in Step 6 of
his grade and has been a GS-13 since 1958. He entered
on duty at the US Station in August 1965. A current
Fitness Report is attached.
2.
Subject's file indicates that he has been recom-
mended for promotion five times: four times by his
superiors in FE Division when he served in Japan, and
once by the US Station in February 1966. While realizing
that the 13 to 14 jump is traditionally difficult we feel
that Subject's performance over the past year, when coupled.
with a consistently high calibre of work in previous years;
deserves much-belated recognition in the form of a promotion.
He continues to be responsible for the US Station's efforts
to exploit the Far Eastern target, and his years of over-.
seas experience against this target have been reflected
in a realistic and imaginative approach to operations in
the United States. His operational activity has required
the handling of persons of varied nationality and 'stature,
close contact with Headquarters representatives, liaison
with the Washington Field Office of the FBI, and liaison
with the US Air Force. His performance has been uniformly
"Strong" and his handling of the HASHARK case has been
outstanding. HASHARK, an Indonesian diplomat, has been a
contact of the Agency for years, but it was not until his
arrival in Washington, and his handling by Subject that he
began to produce solid intelligence on his own country.
Subject's work on this case has received a well-deserved
commendation from Headquarters.

Dear Frederick,
Please accept my appreciation for an assignment
well done as a member of the FY 1979 GS-13 Personnel
Evaluation Board.
Your full-time service with the Board represents
a major contribution to the Directorate's program of
personnel assessment and management. Your recommendations
for promotion, career development, and other matters have
been very helpful.
I believe you will find on return to your regular
duties that this time spent with the Board has broadened
and sharpened your own focus on the personnel aspects of
Agency management. I think it will make you appreciate
more than ever our needs for carefully and candidly
written appraisals of employees.
First
Sincerely,

Commendation
=
=
1. On 9 March 1978, the CIA Information Review
Committee took note of the excellent work done by the
Directorate of Operations in processing requests under
the Freedom of Information and Privacy Acts. The
Deputy Director for Operations was present, as were
other Deputy Directors.
2. I would like to add my endorsement to that of
the CIA/IRC and to commend all those who were/are
involved in the processing of FOIA and PA requests.
Although complex and time consuming, these tasks are
obligatory by federal laws. In meeting the intent of
the law, a difficult balance must be achieved. On the
one hand, the rights of our citizens must be respected.
On the other, the obligation of the Agency to protect
its sources and methods must be honored. In meeting
these rights and obligations, the Directorate of Operations
has handled some 16,000 requests to date. In all instances
where a requester has gone to the federal courts,
(0) has never lost a case based upon our exemptions for
sources and methods or classification.
3.
the
This outstanding result stems directly from the
Very high quality of professionalism, dedication, excellent
judgements by those involved, and close cooperation within
the DO. These characteristics have contributed substantially
to establishing legal and administrative foundations of
considerable value to the U.S. Intelligence Community.
As such, I request that this commendation be placed in the
official files of the individuals, involved for a job well
done!

MEMORANDUM FOR: Acting Chief, EA/PENS
SUBJECT:
Change of Home Base and Functional Category
Frederick C. Randall
1. The Services Staff recently forwarded to your office a
personnel action requesting a change of home-base and functional
category for Mr. Frederick C. Randall. This memorandum is intended
to provide additional information regarding this change as requested
by EA Personnel.
2. Mr. Randall was assigned to the Services Staff in February
1975 to serve as the Freedom of Information Officer for the DDO.
This assignment followed approximately ten years of service with
FR Division. Mr. Randall's performance since reporting to this
Staff has been outstanding. He is currently responsible for a staff
of 12 employees and with the increasing responsibilities as a result
of the enactment of the Privacy Act it is anticipated that additional
personnel will be required in order to handle the workload.
3. Mr. Randall has been responsive in the handling of FOI
requests and is noted for his professionalism, tact, persuasiveness,
and analytic skills. He has done an excellent job of establishing
realistic manpower requirements for the Privacy and Information
Coordinator Staff, keeping up with a heavy workload while training
new employees and making constant adjustments as further experience.
is gained in the administration of the FOI and Privacy Acts.
1
4. It is my opinion, and also OMG's, that Mr. Pandall's strengths
are in a staff assignment such as his current one. Therefore, follow-
ing discussions with Mr. Randall, it was agreed that his home-base
and functional category should be changed from DMC to DAC.
5. If there are any additional questions conceming this
change, I will be glad to discuss it further.

:
Request for a Quality Step Increase for Mr. Frederick
C. Randall, GS-14
1. On the basis of the information presented below, it is
recommended that a Quality Step Increase be approved for Mr. Frederick
.C. Randall.
2. Mr. Randall has been employed by the Agency since September 1951.
He has spent his Agency career in the Operations Directorate serving with
East Asia and Foreign Resources Divisions. He has had field assignments
in Jakarta and Tokyo and spent four years at FR Base, Washington.
3. In early 1975, Mr. Randall was assigned to the Services Staff
to serve as the Freedom of Information Officer for the DDO. In spite of
the ambiguity of evolving guidelines, constant pressure of short deadlines,
a very large volume of work and the cultural trauma the Act and its
implementation generated, Mr. Randall's performance has been outstanding.
He is noted for his professionalism, tact, persuasiveness, analytic skills,
and realistic, while tough-minded, protection of DDO sources and methods.
In addition to his FOI responsibilities, Mr. Randall was just designated
the Privacy Act Coordinator for the DDO. It is still too early to predict
the actual work requirements as a result of this Act, but it is anticipated
that Mr. Randall will meet these added responsibilities in the same
exceptional manner as he has fulfilled his FOI duties.
3. Consideration has been given to the granting of an Honor and
Merit Award. However, it is felt that a Quality Step Increase will
provide more appropriate recognition of Mr. Randall's outstanding
performance during the past seven months in a very challenging and
demanding assignment.

Promotion to GS-14
-
Recommendation for
:
:
1. It is recommended that Frederick C. Randall be promoted
from GS-13 to G3-14. Subject is 39 years old and began his Agency
career in 1951 as a GS-7. He has been a GS-13 since 1958. He
entered on duty at the US Station in August 1965. A current Fitness
Report is attached.
2. As the attached Fitness Report indicates, Subject is a
real plus for the US Station's efforts to exploit the Far Eastern
target locally. His years of experience in the handling of a
variety of Oriental nationals abroad has alrewly resulted in a much
more realistic approach to local FE targets than was the case before
his arrival. In addition to the professional competence and arca
knowledge which Subject brings to his present position, he has an
imaginative approach to operational problems and a high enthusiasm
for his work. His excellent relations with colleagues within FE
Division have been of considerable value in helping the US Station
adjust its operational activity in the FE field to current require-
mente. One final--and strong--factor arguing for his promotion
to GS-14 at this time: he has been in grade eight years and has
been recommended for promotion four times by previous supervisors
when he was on E Division rolls.

Headquarters. My personal/professional interests lie in the field of
international relations in the Far East (I have taught international
politics at the college level and currently am completing a Ph. D.
degree as a part-time after-hour student). I would like to be assigned
to a position in which I could utilize my past operational experience
as well as my substantive interests. My first choice would be a tour
with WOHORN, or if a position there is unavailable at this time, a
similar position within WOMACE.

IN TURN
Mr.
1.. (S) I wish to commend and make a matter of record the
outstanding support rendered to this organization by Mr.
Frederick Randall, Area Liaison Coordinating Detachment,
Tokyo, Japan, from the period of July 1963 to date.
Randall served as the focal point for 6499th Support Group
coordination of various collection operations in consonance
with national and service directives. He was at all times
most tactful and helpful, and all who came in contact with
him left with the feeling that they had met a true profes-
sional.
2.
(S) Mr. Randall contributed greatly to the overall
morale and esprit de corps of those persons charged with
the responsibility of planning for and initiating new
operations to gather data of priority national aerospace
interest. He handled potentially embarrassing situations
with humor, dignity and aplomb. He gave freely of himself
and spent many hours in assisting us in coordinating vari-
ous operations, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of
proposed approaches to collecting information, and in serv-
ing as a most effective go-between this headquarters and
various station chiefs in other areas when operations
under way were multi-national in area. We liked, trusted.
and respected him.
3. (S) Mr. Randall's outstanding effectiveness as a có-
ordinator of intelligence collections was exemplary in
nature and reflected great credit upon him and his parent
organization.

Frederick Randall
1. I am pleased to send to you the attached official notification
of the approval of the Quality Step Increase which you recommended
for this employee.
2. The salary increase accomplished by the award of a Quality
Step Increase is important and tangible evidence of the estoom la
which the employeo se recognised is held. However, I believe tha
commendatory and incentive benefits of this award will be partially
lost unless it is presented in an appropriate ceremony which will
afford the individual recognition among co-workers and supervisory
officiala. Also, I believe such recognition sorvos to inspire other
employees to aspire to earning such recognition.

3. May I ask, therefore, that you arrange to have this Quality
Stop Increase presented at an appropriate ceremony.

Request for Quality Step Increase

Frederick C. Randall
1. On the basis of the information presented below, it is recomended
that a quality step increase be approved for Frederick C. Randall.
2. Mr. Randall has been affiliated with this Agency since September
1951, and has been assigned to the Operational Support Staff at Tokyo
since 1961. Mr. Randall's duties are: Maison with the military clan-
destine intelligence community; commanding officer of a principal Agency
military cover unit; supervisor of the Central Registry; supervisor of the
local TSD establishment; and Agency participation in a multi-agency CI Rep-
ository and an Agency-run multi-agency Central Carding facility. Mr.
Randall's primary duty at the Tokyo Station is Station PBRAMPART respon-
sibilities. These responsibilities are broad and highly important to all
RAMPART relations throughout the Far East. Through Mr. Randall's intensive
effort to strengthern and increase the Agency's role in the coordination
of clandestina-collection activities, he has been able to set a positive
pattern of effective procedures for coordination of the military servicea'
clandestine collection operations. These procedures are now being emulated
wherever possible throughout the Far East. Mr. Randall's tenacity and.
patience, based on solid operational field and Headquarters experience,
have worked to a distinct advantage for the Agency in the RAMPART field.
The Chief of Station, Tokyo has stated that the vast improvement in the
local coordination business has been in large part due to Mr. Randall's
exceptional ability to do a good job. Further, as a supervisor and a
manager, he has quite successfully handled from 10 to 15 subordinates in
the diversified functions listed above.
3. During Mr. Randall's total service at the Tokyo Station, he has
demonstrated his ability and capability to carry out a variety of taaks
in un exemplary manner. Mr. Randall has been in grade as a CS-13 since
September 1958. He has been recommended three times for promotion to GS-14
since 1963. Due to the limited number of promotions mule in this grada
category, he was not selected. The Chief of Station and Chief, Far Kast
Division request that Mr. Randall be granted a quality step increase for
a long tenure of strong performance and as recognition of an outstanding
job well done in his present assignment.

As stated above, Mr. Randall has continued to perform in an except-
ionally strong manner and is expected to continue for the remainder of his
present and future assignments. We have considered the presentation of an
Honor or Merit Award; but the Division feels that a quality step increase
appears to be more appropriate in this particular case due to his extended
period of time in grade without promotion. Mr. Randall is scheduled for
reassignment in June 1965 and we feel the granting of a quality step
increase at this time will indicate our appreciation and recognition of
his excellent performance.

responsibilities. In the most recent recommendation. Chief of Station,
Tokyo emphasize that Mr. Randall a performance was characterized
by exceptional proficiency in all respects of his assigned duties, and,
therefore, endorsed his previous recommendation, and strongly
recommended Mr. Randall's promotion to GS-14 at an early date.
#
4. In the most recent fitness report on Mr. Randall, he was rated
over-all "Strong" and was given "Outstanding" for the Specific Duty
Number One, "PBRAMPART Officer. In the narrative comment on
Mr. Randall's performance the rating officer characterized Mr. Randalt
as capable, vaasatile, and as having a fine career potential. Further, the
-rating officer stated that "because of his sound operational background,
presence of mind, forceful reasoning, and the consideration the military
therefore holds for him. Mr. Randall has been able to play a prime part
in our excellent PBRAMPART posture." The Chief of Station, in
commenting on the rating officer's fiiress report on Mr Randall, heartily
concurred with the rating officer's description of Mr. Randall's performance
and described Mr. Randall's contribution to the Station a being of the
highest caliber.
5. In endorsing the recommendation of Chief of Station, Tokyo, I wish
to add that, from my personal knowledge of Mr. Randall's performance,
he te a thoroughly reliable ard compe.ent case officer. In watching the
PBRAMPART activities during the past year, I strongly commend Tekyo
Station and Mr. Randall for effecting certain improvements of what was
already a rather efficient exce/fination process. Mr. Randall's job in not
always a happy one because he would rather be more active in clandestine
operational activities; however, if Tokyo Station had a less experienced
Pud less competent officer handling the PBRAMPART coordination activities,
this particularly important area of our responsibilities would certainly suffer.
For this and the reasons set forth above, Mr. Randall's performance
deserved recognition by a promotion to CS-14 at this time.

3. During Mr. Randall's total service at the Tokyo Station, he has
demonstrated his adaptability and capability to carry out a variety of
tasks in an exemplary manner. In a previous recommendation, Chief of
Station, Tokyo, described Mr. Randall us an officer capable of assuming
greater responsibilities. In the most recent recommendation, Chief of
Station, Tokyo, emphasized that Mr. Pandall's performance was char-
acterized by exceptional proficiency in all respects of his assigned
duties and, therefore, endorsed his previous recommendation, and strongly
recommended Mr. Randall's promotion to GS-14 at an early date.
4. In endorsing the recommendation of Chief of Station, Tokyo, I wish
to add that, from my personal knowledge of Mr. Randall's performance, he
is a thoroughly reliable and competent case officer. In watching the
PERAMPART as during the past year, I strongly commend Tokyo
Stallon and Mr. Randall for effecting certain improvements of what was
already a rather efficient coordination process. Mr. Randall's job ia not
always a hoppy one because he would rather be more active in clandestine
operational activities; however, if Tokyo Station had a leas experienced
and competent officer handling the PBRAMPART coordination activities,
this particularly important area of our responsibilitied world certainly
suffer. For this and the reasons net forth above, Mr. Randall's perform-
ance deserves recognition by a promotion to GS-14 at this time,

Promotion Recommendation
->
Frederick C. Randall to GS-15
1. This memorandum constitutes a formal recommendation that Fred
Randall, GS-14/8, now Chief of the DDO Privacy Information (DDO/PIC)
unit in Services Staff, be promoted to GS-15. The position calls for
that grade.
2. Mr. Randall is 49 years of age; entered on duty in CIA in
September 1951 as a GS-7. assigned to OSO/FDZ. He is married; has four
children, served briefly in the Air Force (1945-46); has an AB in
Government, an AM in Foreign Affairs, and was a PhD candidate in
International Relations. His Agency service was in FE from 1953 to
1965, including overseas tours in Djakarta and Tokyo; in DOD/FRD
from 1965 to March 1975, including 2 years in the DC field office;
his current assignment dates from 16 March 75. His date of grade is
June 1967.
3. The specifics of Mr. Randall's current assignment and all the
superlatives about it I have just recounted in a fitness report which
I prepared today, as well as in a QSI recommendation (approved) of
October 1975 and an out-of-cycle promotion recommendation dated
8 August 1975. I rate his performance Outstanding and refer the
reader(s) to the reports cited for details. I would note here that
Mr. Randall changed his home base and functional category in November
of 1975 and was rated number 1 of 4 Category C nominees from this Staff
by all four members of the SS Panel. I would note further that when
I submitted my August 75 out-of-cycle promotion recommendation, Mr.
Randall's career designation was B/OG; given his personal circumstances
the DDO suggested that Randall change his career designation to become
more competitive "and have an excellent chance on the next go round."
The QSI suggestion then resulted.
.
4. As the individual responsible for releasing or denying
thousands of DDO documents in response to FOIA requests, and subsequently
answering for DDO decisions in affidavits and court depositions, I know
how well Fred does his work and how richly he deserves this promotion to
CS-15.

As you know, OB is not reticent about expressing his views, and in the informal
career development world, Fred had had it in FRD. I've known OB fairly well and re-
spect his candor and professionalism; we just worked very well together on the GS-
16/17 Panel, with an interestingly identical philosophy. Fred's performance did not
satisfy OB, and his Fitness Reports reflect that fact. It does not surprise me, since
Fred had been in FR from 1970-1975, that his Fitness Reports for the past years would
put him in a neutral middle, or even low middle, ranking among B/O officers. But
that's yesterday.
Today, as I tried to say strongly in my 8 August memo, my view of his work is
that it is Outstanding--and I don't so rate many officers. I would hope his present
work could stand on its own merit, and project forward, expecting FOIA to be a way of
life in the DDO with all the management challenge, and headache, that poses. His
present and future peer competition should be with the A/C crowd, not the B/06 group--
if that hurdle is determining.
At the risk of being irritating, I feel bound to state his case in what I con-
sider the appropriate competitive environment, to avoid an out-of-cycle suggestion
doing mischief to the system. Any hope?

I am aware of the fact that the Central Intelligence
Agency, by reason of the sensitive nature of its work, must
observe very strict security measures. I agree to honor the
requests of CIA relative to my application whether it be
accepted or rejected. I agree not to inform anyone that I am
being considered for a position in CIA. If questioned directly,
I will say that I have applied for positions in various govern-
ment agencios, and if pressed for an answer will acknowledge that
CIA is one of them but will attach no particular significance to
such application. I agree not to disclose personnel procedures
I have observed in CIA. I agree not to discuss by namo or
otherwise, any individuals with whom I have talked in the course
of my application to CIA.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Operations
SUBJECT:
Out-of-Sequence Promotion Recommendation:
Fred Randall
i
1. We've spoken of the need to look further at both Agency
and DDO implications of the Freedom of Information Act and, now,
the Privacy Act, including the increased number of appeals and
litigation cases, and of the logic of collecting a coterie of
depoñents or affiants to take some of the load off of both you
and me.
The grade level of the appeals officers and the deponents
must include 14's and 15's, to incorporate the necessary clout
with the divisions and judgment vis-a-vis release of information
to the outside world.
2. Fred is a GS-14/7. He had just come to me at the time of
the last GS-15 panel exercise and had not been recommended for
promotion by FRD. I consider his performance over the past 6 months
to have been Outstanding. He is head and shoulders above the other
directorates' FIOS; I have considerable laudatory testimony from
OGC, OLC, 0/DDA and within the DDO as to his professionalism, tact,
persuasiveness, analytic skills and realistic, while tough-minded,
• protection of DDO sources and methods. This includes occasional
arm-wrestling with DDO branch/division/staff chiefs, OGC and OLC
lawyers, FBI contacts and others above his current grade level.
3. I have discussed this proposed out-of-cycle promotion
recommendation to GS-15 with Ev, who, in turn, has mentioned it
to Gordon. The return signals I got sounded positive.
4. I dọ, therefore, recommend that you, approve Fred's promotion
to GS-15, effective as soon as the action can be cut.
