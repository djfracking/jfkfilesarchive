Attached is a draft of an amendment on TICHOEN.
Note semo of reatest asks for an increase in basic
fee from $12,000 to $17,000 based on TICHPOPN's
"overall performance and full time services". Thià
Additional memoranda in file reflect the
following:
(1) 19 May 1961 contract (still in effect) provided
a basic fea of SS000 with no mention of amount
of time subject worked to earn such.
Wi mamo of 13 June 63 asked a pay increase from
$3000 to $5,000 based upon, "manner of TICHBORN's
performance and the increase amt. of time which
he devotes to Agency requirements".
(3) a dispatch of 9 Nov 64 said that, "Hqs agrees
that present expiring contract called for about
2/3rds subject's time---TICHROHN pointed out....
he now engaged 90% of his time for Agency".
(4) WH memo of 24 Nov 64 requested an increase from
$9000 to $12,000 based upon TICHBORN's increased
value plus "using TICHBO's service on
substantially a full time basis".
(5) As cited above, current WH memo of 7 Oct 66 asks
for an increase of 4 from $12,000 to $17,000
based on subject's "overall performance and full
time services".
I pointed out the above chroro with respect to
the ever increasing usage of subject's time to Renehah
ver
who apparently feels the last mero is OK unless CPD
desires to make a formal objection and return it.

Mr.
Dear Mr._ALAND
:
Reference is made to your current contract with the United States
Government, as represented by the Contracting Officer.
Arrangements have been recently completed allowing certain
Independent contractors of this organization to obtain social security
credits by covering such individuals under the social security tax
provisions applicable to employees. These arrangements also include
a provision for retroactive applicability to the beginning of the
1965 tax year. This can be done only for reasons of security since
the procedure results in reducing the social security tax from the
self-employed rate to the employee rate. For example, in January
of 1965 the tax rates were 5.4% and 3-5/8% respectively.
As a consequence thereof, said contract is amended by deleting
all reference to social security and by adding the following paragraph:
"Effective I December 1964, social security taxes will be covertly
deducted by this organization from your compensation in the same
manner and to the same extent as would be done if you were a Govern-
ment employee. Security reasons make this procedure necessary. Its
implementation does not imply in any manner the actual creation of an ·
employee-employer relationship, Your legal status under this agree-
ment continues to be that of an independent contractor.
If you receive or expect to receive full or partial social security.
credits from overt sources you will so notify this organization and an
adjustment will be made or covert deductions discontinued, depending
upon the circumstances. Further, if you should subsequently receive
overt social security credits, evidence thereof will be submitted to this
organization. In such event your covert credits will be erased and your
covert deductions returned.
All other terms and conditions of said contract remain in full force
and effect.
