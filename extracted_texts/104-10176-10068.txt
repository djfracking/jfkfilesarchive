information is this report from an associate of Rolando
Masferrer Rojas.
On 20 August 1965 an associate of Rolando Arendio Masferrer
Rojas, former Cuban senator, said that Hasferrer is in touch
with General Lese Cantave regarding a plot to invade Haiti
from the Dominican Republic. Masferrer is trying to recruit
unmarried Cubans in New York who are willing to go to the
Dominican Republic and eventually to live in Haiti. He does
not want Cubans who would want to return to the United States
because of family or for any other reason.
Hasferrer asked Antonio Rojas Masferrer, his cousin, to manage
a farm in the Dominican Republic which will be used as a
training and staging area for about 100 men which Masferrer
recruit. This group will be enlarged by men which Cantavo
has in the Dominican Republic.
Cantave is negotiating with Dominieses to determine whether
the recruits from New York will travel to the Dominican
Republic with vicas or whether they will enter the country
illegally.

MICROFILMED
2P
1. · In accordance with our conversation, I am sending you the
facts as I know them regarding the 7 August meeting in New York City
between Rolando Masferrer and Averell Clark."
XJ
2. Apparently Masferrer knows Stanley Ross, the Editor of El
Tiempo, a Spanish-language newspaper published in New York. The
office is at 78 Fifth Avenue and the telephone number is WA 4-2750.
Possibly Masferrer did not previously know Ross. But at any rate, either
on his own or through someone else, he got in touch with him in late July
or early August and said that he wanted to be put in touch with an American
with an aviation and military background. I do not know too much about
Ross at the moment except that he has had considerable Latin American
experience and would be a logical person for any Latino to approach. It
would be very easy to obtain additional evidence on him if desired,
3. I am attaching for your information a list of the stockholders
in El Tiempo, Inc. to provide some indication of who is behind Ross. In
addition, we have a list of all the senior officers of El Tiempo.
4. Ross knew of Clark through the Hitchcocks listed, as you will
note, as stockholders. Mrs. Margaret Hitchcock is Clark's aunt, while
Thomas Hitchcock III is his first cousin as presumabiy, is William
Hitchcock. During the war Clark was an outstanding fighter pilot, having
flown with the RAF through the roughest days of the Battle of Britain, and
thereafter shifted to the Americans with whom he flew many missions as
a P-47 pilot. He is still in the Air Force Reserve.
5. At Ross's request Clark met Masferrer at the El Tiempo office
in New York City on 7 August. Ross left the room so that the session was
only between Clark and Masferrer. As a pro-Batista Cuban, Masferrer
was known to us at the time of the Bay of Pigs. In fact, at one point just
before the invasion, the U.S. Department of Justice arrested him and put
him in jail in Florida for violation of the provisions of the Neutrality Act.

Former high-level Latin American Goverment official (C) who has
travelled frequently throughout the Caribbean and Central America
where he maintains close friendships with a wide range of military
and political leaders. Source is a rightist, a trained reporter,
and his information has been fairly reliable in the past. This
information was obtained from Rolando Arcadio Masferrer Rojas..
1. Bolando Arcadio Masferrer Rojaz, prominent Cuban exile and financial
backer of several Caribbean paramilitary operations directed against
Fidel Castro Ruz, revealed on 11 July 1964 that he is maintaining
close contact with Dominican Consul Carlos Peguero Guerrero, the
brother of General Belisario Peguero Guerrero, Dominican Police
Chief. Masferrer said that he is collaborating with Consul Peguero
by giving his full support to the Partido Liberal Evolucionista
(PLE, Liberal Evolutionist Party) and that he is ready to go to
the Dominican Republic should Luis Amiama Tio, a leader of the
PLE, call for him. When discussing the method by which Masferrer
was participating with the PLE, Masferrer suggested that he vas
prepared to offer his Cuban assets to the Dominican supporters
of Amiama should the latter decide to carry out action against
the triumvirate government,
Concerning the future of Joaquin Balaguer as a Dominican presi-
dential candidate, Masferrer said that Balaguer was "mistaken"
in his belief that he would soon be able to return to the Dominican
Republic. The Dominican authorition will not permit the return
of Balaguer because Diego Pordas Hernandez, former leader of the
Partido Revolucionario Dominicano (PRD, Dominican Revolutionary
Party), was successfully financing a "stop Balaguer” movement.

According to Hasferrer, Bordas recently paid Stanley Ross,
editor of the New York publication "El Tiempo", $5,000 to assist
Bordas in stopping Balaguer from obtaining favorable publicity
in the Ross publications.
Concerning the next candidate supported by the PLE, Masferrer
said that the PLE political machine had planned to promote
General Antonio Imbert Barrera instead of Amiama although Amiama
had previously been pushed for the presidential candidacy with
the support of the PLE.
Concerning Cuba, Masferrer said that he has 250 highly trained
men available for paramilitary action against the Castro regize.
He is personally carrying out daily practice sessions in a light
twin-engine aircraft in preparation for future flights to be
made by Masferrer in distributing propaganda and attacking strategie
points in Cuba. He has no immediate plans, however, for an in-
vasion nor did he reveal the locations of arms and money which
he claims to have at his disposal. He said, however, that he has
Euch faith in the United States Government and its appraisal of
the Cuban probles and expected a "green light" to be forthcoming
from the United States Government soon.
Hasferrer said that unfortunately several prominent politicians
and government officials have been recommending that he not be
permitted to return to the State of Florida in spite of an earlier
petition signed by many Cuban exiles requesting an amendment to
an earlier court ruling prohibiting K sferrer from returning to
Florida.l
When asked about the participation of other Cuban exile leaders
with Masferrer's group, Hasferrer did not comment other than to
say that Carlos Marquez Sterling was a "lyric poet" but that his
association with Masferrer had not been productive.
1. Field Comment: Refer to CSDB-3/661,878, dated 19 June 1964,
regarding the efforts of Masferrer's brother to obtain the
signatures of Cuban exile leaders, which he intended to sub-
mit to the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Miami
with a request for Masferrer's legal return to Miami.

6. Masferrer alleged to Clark that he was representing some twenty
Cuban exile organizations, and that he was working with a Haitian, Charles
Forben, head of an anti-Duvalier organization known as "Capois La Mort."
Forben allegedly asked Masferrer to help his organization by leasing or
buying a PBY-5 aircraft for use against Duvalier. Masferrer claimed that
Forben's group was in a position to take control of the Ile de la Gonave; .
an island just off the west coast of Haiti in the gulf north of Port au Prince.
It is conceivable that this is the wrong island since Clark did not have the
name of the island in question, but based on the description of its location
by Masferrer, I am assuming this to be the island involved. At any rate,
in return for help from Masferrer, Forben was to be asked to let Masferrer
and some of his Cuban exiles use the island in question as a base from which
to harrass the eastern end of the Island of Cuba.
7. Clark told Masferrer that as a member of the Air Force Reserve,
he would have to report the conversation to the USG and could not do any-
thing without clearing with the USG. Masferrer said that he had no objection
to this, particularly with regard to the activities of Forben and his group,
but he asked that Clark not mention his intention to harrass Cuba, since he
maintained that the USG would forbid this as being against USG policy. Clark
said that Masferrer would have to leave to him what matters he chose to
discuss with the USG. It was then agreed that Clark could reach Masferrer
through Ross's office for about a week, and thereafter could pass a message
to him through Ross.
8. Clark got in touch with me because I had known him during the
war; I had known his family for many years, and one of his closest friends,
James B. Watriss, is a cousin of mine and was, until about a year ago,
associated with the Agency. Incidentally, I believe that Clark has had some
discussions with SOD with the idea of possibly being used in connection with
special operations.
