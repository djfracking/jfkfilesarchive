speaking of the havoc the U-boats made along

close to America as you can see by this book's
picture of an American tanker torpedoed off the
Jersey shore. You can also apply. Churchill's
observation to many other pictures, particularly
those of the black days after Pearl Harbor. The.
book's last shot shows a combat veteran who
might be in Korea today. The final text by Mr.

viewpoint of the Kromlin. It evaluates the opportunities for
conquest as Stalin and his honchon see them, and shows why the
Soviets chose to take action now in Korea rather than elsewhere.
It also shows how the U.S. is mooting the challenge in Koroai
the mobilisation of manpower and industry; the reactivation of
planes, tanks, and ships laid up since the end of im II and the actions
which the US is taking with other mumbers of the UI to check permanently
the aggressions of Stalin and his Communist satellites.

Also Boris Shab has a book coming out on the cold war
and propaganda"
Are you sending complimentary copies to Drew Pearson and
to Bernard Baruch? The latter's recent article in "Look" had a
sentence or two faintly, but only faintly, along the lines of the
choice.
If you have a copy to spare, why not send one to Gen. Fodamayar

"To choose the victim, carefully prepare the blow, satisfy an
implacable vengeance, then go to bed. There ismothing sweeter
in the world."
(Stalin to serjinaki and Kamenev in the course of a conversation
held in the spring of 1923.)
Tou think that Stalin is worrying himself trying to find
reply to your arguments? You are şistaken. He is only considering
in what manner he can suppresa ou without danger to himself
(Kamenev to Trotsky in 1923.)
"He would have got rid of you at any moment since 1924
had not feared reprisals from the youth section in the for of
terrorist activities. That is why Stalin has decided to start by
destroying the framework of the opposition and then to kill you
afterwards, when he is sure of being able to do so with impunity.
(Zinoview to Trotsky in 1925.)

"If we die suddenly, let it be known that it is the work of

to the general effect; "At first glance it passes credibility that the rulare

COORDINATOR
Meeting, May 12, 1942 Statement of rs. Clare Lice
-
Ers. Laceltravelled to the Idle and Farms via the Trans-African
ferry route, Visiting Dung, India, and the dle East. She had extensive oppor
tunities for formal and informal conversation with the major military and
political figures, well as various operating airmen, soldiers, and
correspondents. Sho carefully distinguished the quality of her sources,
indicating where her views were based on observed fects, official statements,
or gossip.
H
II Rumeland Chẳng
Mrs. Lice arrived at Lashio at the time of the visit of Chiang and
Hadame Chiang. Their intervention was required not only to facilitate
cooperation between the British and General Stillwell's Chinese forces,
but also to enforce discipline on the Chase generals nominally inder
Stillwell. It was rumored that a major cortunity to cefest the Japanese
was lost at Tonou due to the unwillingness of the Chinese generals to obey
Stillwell and attack. The arrival of the Chians was immediately known to
the Japanese who bombed the headquarters area for the first time in force.
Mandalay, which rs. Luce saw immediately after the main bombing attack
carly in April, was leveled and deserted, with two to five thousand dead.
left in the ruins.
In a long-conversation with Madame Chieng great bitterness was expressed
against the British. Madame Chiang went back to Hong Kong, the Treaty Forts,
and the Opiumar, ending up with avell's failure to accept Chinese assist-
ance in Durn. Madame Chiang indicated, however, that she would not accept
a negotiated nece under any circumstances with the Japanese, recalling, the
Japanese occupation of Nanking. Under questioning irs. Luce state that.
phe did not believe the nanese would move in force against China. All
Intelligence sources in Chunking believe that the Japanese will move agüinst
Russia before June of this year. As for india rs. Luce stated that a full-
fledged invasion by land forces seemed wisely in the immediate future,
but that bombing attacks on the Calcutta oa were very likely -- these
designed to exploit the political instability here and the concentration
of Indian industrial strength.
In general rs. Luce believes that the British in Burma fought as well..
as their resources permitted. The R.A.F. was bombed out of us early,
lagu
leaving the main operations without air protection. The British claim that
their radio directional finders were sabotaged by the Burmese
the Burmese
elsewhere gossip stated that the finders had been withdrath Column;
"
prior to the
Japanese attack. The one hundred British tanks proved ineffective as the.
main highway, on which they could operate, was flanked by forests through
which the Japanese filtered. The presence of american technicians in the
Burma oil fields probably guaranteed thorough destruction. Elsewhere there
was "no earth worth scorching". The British General Alexander expressed
the general belief that the failure in our wes, in the long run, un
important; that after the defeat of Hitler the Japanese, could easily be

driven out. This blandness seemed to characterize the view of almost
all Britishers in the Far East, although the Vicerecy of India expressed
regret that, for the sake of the Indians, British control in India would
"not survive another fifty years".
lars. Luce visited the headquarters of the ... She expressed the
hope that they would not be kept alive as a unit; but that their experience
in fighting Japanese planes would be transferred to american pilots in
training, especially at Karachi. She felt that neither the A.V.G. nor Goneral
Stillwell should return to China, despite their obvious value in maintaining
and American link and american prestige. General Stillwell has apparently:
dis nguished himself, under nost trying circumstances, by his comradeship
with the Chinese and his willingess to share front-line cangers and hard-
ships. At a time when the Chinese are extremely sensitive, General Still-
well's attitude and action were of great importance.
III India
.
n
Indian morale is extremely low, lower in fact than before the Cripps
Mission. The net result of the Mission appears merely to have strengthened
Gandhi and the policy of passive resistance. Mrs. Luce believes, however,
that, in a short run at least, there is nothing wrong with the morale of
the Indians and the Chinese that could not be corrected by a couple of
substantial victories. Tavell, in a letter to rs. Luce expressed himself
as more concerned about Indian morale and possible military consequences'
of that situation, than with the strictly military aspects of defense.
Hrs. Luce spoke very highly of General Brereton as a member of that new
race, the air man". It is Brereton's view that no important action should
be taken by the air force under his command until they are in a position
of local superiority; he did, however, "leak: a little", by bombing the Andaman
Islands and rangoon. Mrs. Luce believes that a first-line air force main-
tained at 300 planes in India could defeat the Japanese in any move in that
direction.
IV Middle Fast
General well is reported to be extremely popular in the Middle
East; while General Adler was unpopular, possibly cue to his forthrightness
in criticising the British methods. Mrs. Luce visited the most advanced
tank station in the British controlled desert area. She found numerous
complaints, not specified, about American equipment. In general, however,
she holds that the British have done a good job in the desert
"
The British in Cairo have had extensive and chronic difficulties with
their various allies. A Jugoslav revolution almost took place in Cairo

JBILI: The main theme should be "Where are they now?", -all
these individuals and countries that have been outmaneuvered and taken
over and liquidated by Stalin.
When you are writing for mass distribution, your technique
should be: "I will tell you this, I am telling you it, I have told you it".
Sims: The thread running through it, starting with Lenin, could be:
Cunning, plus "Ruthlessness" (one of Lenin's favorite words), plus complete
Intolerance of any opposition to a very narrow and constantly-being-purged
Kremlin cliquē. Moral: (1) "Nobody can trust these people", and (2) "Because

How can we possibly do justice to Purges-under-Stalin, as described by

CONGRESS FOR CULTURAL FREEDOM
Berlin, Germany
26 to 30 June, 1950
1. Origin and Purpose
Early in 1950 a plan was conceived to gather together in.
Berlin, in the heart of Soviet Germany, a representative group of
the Western World's intellectual leaders and to provide them with
an instrument to repudiate the totalitarian concept of intellec-
tual subservience to the state. OFC planned to convene the Con-
gress of Cultural Freedom in June 1950 at a moment most advanta-
gecus to counteract the psychological effect of the Soviet-sponsored
ſhitsuntide Youth Dally. The reetings and pronouncements of the
Congrass were to be videly publicized by prosa, radio and printed
material not only to the Western World but by sustained clandestine
distribution in communist-controlled areas.
20
35
1
II. Development
To achieve maximum effect and credibility, it was apparent from
the outset that the actual sponsorship of such a convention should
not be permitted to appear. Accordingly, the Congress for Cultural
Freedom ostensibly sprang into being as the inspiration of a meet-
Ing between Ernst Reuter, Lord Mayor of Berlin; Dr. Otto Suhr, Rector
of the Berlin College of Political Science, and Dr. Pedalcb, Rector
of the Free University of Berlin. Melvin J. Lasky, HICOG editor of
the intellectual periodical, Der Monat, was introduced into the
formative committee and nominated Acting General Secretary to steer
the operation for OFC.

gathering together these widely-scattered individuals at the site
of the Congress required the closest coordination with and coopera-
tion of official and private United States agencies and individuals
of many nationalities. The delicate matter of covertly financing
the travel and expenses of delegates for example, had to be accom-
plished with the assistance of three American committees with estab-
lished interests in international affairs. An enormous amount of
organizational detail was handled in Berlin and elsewhere on the
continent and in the U. S. under OFC sponsorship and direction.
Provision of interpreters, press and radio coverage, an elaborate
book display, accommodations for personal comfort and security of
the delegates and facilities for the official business of the
Congress, were among the problems which had to be solved.

IV. Future Plane
The first meeting of the Executive Committee, which will be con-
trolled by OPC, is scheduled for Paris, in September, at which time
arrangements will be made for future sessions of the Congress and
the continued exploitation of its activities and the anti-communist
declarations of its members.

ACTIVITIES IN GERMANY OF BORIS ĮVANCVICH NIKOLAEVSKI

historian and journalist and head of the New York socialist
League, has been in Germany for the past six weeks attempting
to line up support for a bloo of Russian groups of the left
and conter and to promote a congress of "decoration elements

Ho has also made numerous side trips to seek out refugees in

however, no agreement has been reached between these groups
for the formation of a united organization, and NTS, following
its oustomary practice, has indicated a willingness
cooperate but has not committed itself beyond that point.

left wing of the New York League by virtue of the Vlasovito
antecedents of these organizations, but feels that he can
eventually gain the support of his own organization

After the Berlin Congress for Cultural Freedom, in which
Nikolaevski played a prominant and enthusiastic role, he
conceived a new projeot, namely the convocation of a confèranco
in Paris under the sponsorship of the permanent executive
committee created at the Berlin Congress, The Paris congress
would be attended by "democratio" Russian emigres, both old
and new, as well as by "democratio" leaders and intellectuals
from Western Europe and the United States, including a number
who attended the Berlin conference. The principal purpose of
.
'
the Paris congress would be propagandistic; it would, in
Nikolaevski's words, constitute a demonstration of the solidarity
of anti-Communist sentiment among the Russian emigration and
the democratic forces of the Western world.
Nikolaovski is a convinced and doctrinaire socialist an
is firmly opposed to cooperation with or apparantly even
exposure to those groups within the ent gratien which are not
ideologically sympathetic to him. His particular antipathy is
directed toward the Supreme Monarchist Council (VMS) and its
president, Yuri Meyer,
Yuri Meyer, who, he claims, is manipulated by the
slaister behind-the-scenes figure of Colonel Baranovaki. He
ean pred use no evidence beyond rumor to support his allegations
regarding the role of Colonal Baranovaki who himself has person
ally denied to me in the most emphatis terms that he plays any
political mole whatsoever. It is a striking coincidence that
Colonel Neryanin, the head of SVOD, one of the organizations
which Nikolaevaki includes in his proposed union, is one of the
principal assistants in the intelligence network of Colonel
Baranovaki, who expresses the highest regard for him.
"
•
I suggested to Nikolaevaki, and discussed with him at
considerable length, the desirability of broadening the proposad
Paris congress to include representatives of all the principal
groups represented in the emigration. I pointed out that the
propaganda value of a congress in which the prinsipal elements
in the emigration were represented would be substantially
greater than that of a meeting with culy fragmentary representa-
tion; that a meeting from which certain influential groups ware
excluded might result in a riral congress which would merely
underline the diversive trends within the emigration and tend
to crystallize them; that a congress meeting under the banner
démoɔraoy should be prepared to permit a demooratie expression
of opinion; and that participation in a meating of this kind
with rival groups would in no sense constitute endorsement or
approval of their programs. To these arguments Nikolaevski
tumed a deaf ear. He stands ffmly on the position that the
social demo arata, whom he consistently refers to as "demoorata,”
cannot afford to compromise themselves or endanger their standing
with the Russian people by the slightest evidence of scoperation
with the right wing.

Nikolaevaki is extremely anions to gain the blessing
of the United States Government for his Faris venture.
told him frankly that while I was in no position to express
an official opinion and could not venture a guess as to
Washington's' reaction, it seemed unlikely to me that the
Amerion Government could afford to take sides in the internal
political struggle within the Russian emigration, and that
until the emigre groups succeeded in reconciling their own
differences and were prepared to concentrate their efforts
against the Soviet regime rather than against each other, the
American Government would hardly be in a position to associate
itself in any way with them. Nikolaevaki replied that the
anti-Communist stragale itself was an inadequate program and
that something positive must be offered to the Russian people,
I agreed, to this position but suggested that a uni sed pregran
on which emigration could agree would probably have
ter imnast than a variety of programs offered by cannating
groups, Nikolaevski, however, stuak to his ideological guns,
Hikolaevaki was considerably perturbed by nows he received
just before his departure from Frankfurt to the effect that
Yakovlev had been approached by Colonel Kromladi, who is
nominated in the Kelley memorandum as the leader of the united
front organization, to lend the support of SBOR to an emigre
congress to be convened in Munich. Yakovlev bad gained the
Impression that this project had American support, although
Kromladi bad apparantly made no explicit statement to this
effect. He had based his arguments on the broad concept of
united engre effort against the Soviet regime and had indicated
that it would be a congress of Russian patrists rather them
of representatives of emigre organizations. This appeal had
obviously made a considerable impression on Yakovlev, who is
much less ideologically minded than Nikolaevski and much more
inclined to ally himself with any ectivity which he feels
can effectively bring pressure against the Soviets.
Nikolaevski, while expressing high personal regard for
Colonel Kromiadi, immediately attributed this project to the
machinations of Meyer and Baranovski and adopted a completely
negative attitude toward it. I told him that I had had no
previous knowledge of the project and that I felt reasonably
sure that it did not enjoy American support.

Nikolaevski plans to proceed to France and attend the
first meeting of the executive committes established at the
Berlin Congress in an effort to interest them in his project
for a congress of Russian emigres.

If Nikelaevad.in his intreagent position is supported
by his organisation, which I aesume will be the case, it
will present a serious otetsels to day plans for uniting the
forces of the Russian emigration in the anti-Communist
struggle. Rikolaevski's idological principles are so
firmly enrcated that it unlikely that anything will
shake them or that he can be pereaded to cosperate with
groups whose political visse diffar markedly from his own,
Nikolaevski's name and pon curry great influence among
Russian emigres and it is most desirable that they be utilized
to the utmost. It would be alter realistic nor practical,
however, te moept Mikolaevski's position and thereby eliminate
other influential groans within the amigrating. One mlation
for this dilemma might be to ignore the extremist groups
right and left, which refuse to perticipate in the common
effort and concentrate primarily on the new emigration who

COMPIDATIAL
14 August 1950
22/224
The following views of 131GONOV on the Berlin Congress have been
reported as of interest to the sponsors of the ongress.
The Forlin Congress is regarded in France as a movement
exclusively of the extreme left, of former Communists and
present non-Salinito Marxists. Observers regard with
disfarer the fact that the Congress has extremely mild in
its back against the Soviet regime. They point out that
(a) The Soviet regime as such is not mentioned in
a single resolution, which limited themselves
to the condemning "totalitarian regines."
(b) The issuance of an anti-Franco resolation in
the absence of an anti-Stalin resolution is
significant,
(c) The refusal to recognize the representatives of
the Russian NTS group present at the Congress
23"listed, dolegates" confims the extreme left-
ist nature of the Congress,

MEMORANIKIN OF CONVERSATION
SUBJECT: Congress for Cultural Freedan
18 August 1950
1. On 15 August. I discussed the Berlin Cultural Congress
with Kenneth H. Eambley, with particular emphasis on the problem
of bringing the continuing Congress organisation under control
and, at the same time, expanding it into an effective anti-
communist weapon.
2. I expressed to Ramblay our concern over the manner in
which Charles A. Skeggs had conducted himself during the Congress.
He said,
and Harbley replied that he had been equally concerned.
however, that while Skeggs activities had caused an unfavorable
reaction on the part of a number of the delegates, that reaction
had been more directed against Skeggs personally than against him.
as a representative of the government. Eambley agreed with my
suggestion that two bits of silver lining could be found in the
Skeggs cloud, namely that he had taken most of the opposition
heat himself, this sparing some of our other people, and that
he had conducted himself like anything but the "Polizeispitzel”
In fact,
the communist press of Germany made him out to be.
said Harbley, Skeggs general attitude was such as to cause some
of the delegates to disremember that Skegge was attached to the
government in any fashion or presumably subject to any discipline
at all.
3. Hambley said that most of the delegates with whom he
had talked were perfectly willing to accept the explanation that
the Congress was smiled upon by the United States Government to
the extent that some official funds were supplied for the physical
staging of the meeting (as indeed they were) but that the rest
of the money came from somewhat vague unofficial sources in the
United States. Those who suspected something more, with the
exception of the Trevor-Roper group, ware generally happy that
the United States was doing something of this kind and were in
no mood to ask any embarrassing questions or raise any delicate
points.
4. I asked Hambley, what he thought his future role in the
Congress should be. He replied that he was perfectly willing to
undertake any activities we asked him to undertake but personally
felt he should retire into the background as rapidly as possible.

MEMORANDUM FOR L. BRECKIMRIDGE
SUBJECT:
REFERENCE:
Berlin Congress for Cultural Freedom; activities of
Kelvin Lasky.
Memɔ fr EE-3/Glaser to CES dtd ↳ Aug 50 m/atts (TSL2928).
1.
I continue to be very disturbed about the manner in which this
entire matter has been conducted, including the non-observance of my
original memorandum of 7 April 1950, in which I approved this project,
subject to the condition that Lasky would not be permitted to figure
publicly in this operation. The memorandum of Mr. Glaser and the con-
versations which I have had with Messrs. Lindsay and-Baker have done
very little to reli apprehension on the score that no effective
my
action to exclude Lasky from continuing to play a blatantly conspicuous
role either has or will be taken by us.
2. I submit that paragraph six of the reference memorandum, in
both tone and content, is entirely unsatisfactory for the following
reasons:
t
a. It fails to reveal any appropriate acknowledgment or
comprehension of the damage which has resulted from Mr. Lasky's
conduct. This was a major blunder, has been branded as such by.
our best friends in the State Department, has been revealed as
such by the publicity which is analyzed in the reference memoran-
dum itself and must be acknowledged by the responsible members
of our staff both here and in Germany.
b. It betrays an unfortunate tendency, apparently more
deeprooted than I had suspected, to succumb to the temptation
of convenience (doing things the easy way) and irrespective of
security and other technical considerations of the utmost.
importance.
3. I have stated to Mr. Lindsay orally and I want to make myself
completely clear on this point that unless means can be found to sand-
tize this operation by the removal of Lasky, Burnham and other persons
of known or traceable official significance from overt roles in the
proposed continuing organization, then I am unwilling to have CPC

I told him that fooling coincided entirely with our own views and
that we would expect him to conduct himself in that fashion.
It was agreed that he should continue as a member of the Inter
national Committee of Twenty-five but should take no active overt
part in organizational for policy matters and would operate behind
the scenes only when so directed.
5. I discussed with him the problem raised by the presence
of David Rousset and Ignazio Silone on the Executive Committee.
Hambley agreed that neither of these individuals could be con-
sidered fully reliable but explained it had been impossible to
exclude them from the Committee because of their prominence and
the interests which they represented. He said he led Rousset
as a person who considered himself basically on the American side
even though from time to time he had to make noises of a sort to
satisfy his leftist constituents.. Ee also described Rousset as
i
a bit of a bluffer who could be handled by a combination of firmness
and tact, particularly so long as to continued to desire to be.
an American ally. Hambley described Silone as a more complex case--
a vain, egocentric person of strong intellect but weak will and
an inept politician who insisted on engaging in politics solely
to satisfy his ego. Eambley said Silɔne probably would have
been lost to the cause entirely had he not been given a prominent
role including a position on the Executive Committee but that,
as it was, he appeared on the surface now to be a convert, albeit
a dubious one. Humbley expressed belief, however, that Silone
could be controlled if handled expertly and that, if worst caze
to worst, he could be separated from the Committee without dis-
astrous effect. Hambley said that in his opinion Arthur Koestler
and Cario Schild were altogether reliable politically and could
be depended upon to counterbalance Stlone and Roussot even though
it would be unwise to take them fully into confidence as to the
nature of the Congress' backing. Irving Brown, of course, is
considered completely reliable.
6. Inasmuch as the Executive Committee is a creature of
the Committee of Twenty-five and draws its membership from that
Committee, the latter constitutes the real point of control in
the Congress organization. The Committee of Aventy-five, as
it stands, is reliable on balance. If necessary, it could be
weighted more heavily in our favor by exercise of the privilege
of co-opting additional members on whom we could depend, Hembley
Baid. He suggested that it might be well to establish a principle
either of rotating members of the Executive Committee or of com
ducting regular elections of the parent Committee of Twenty-five.
probably preferably the latter. This mechanism would provide
means whereby obstreperous Executive Committee members might
be sidetracked. Humbley agreed that this might prove a workable
scheme.

b. The impact of the Congress on Berlin was terrific and
Reuter's part magnificent. The whole city was very eager and
receptive and paid an extraordinary amount of attention to all
of the Congress estivities. The book display at the Congress
itself was only fairly effective, but was extremely telling in
the book stores throughout Western sectors, which made special
displays of the books and photographs of the authors. Broad-
casting by radic PLUS seems to have been more or less nominal,
although FIAS cares of all of the Commess speeches, but the
Voice of Perica team did a first-class end absolutely outstanding
job. The Congress was given big coverage by VOA in several lan-
guages. In addition to the records of Eurerean publicity that
are on hand, a considerable additional amount was produced. For
instance, there was daily broadcasting of = French radio station
and sporadic broadcasting coverage by other stations. There was
a large amount of publicity in France and England and a substan-
tial amount in Italy, Sweden and other countries. Special art-
icles are still appearing in the European press and periodicals.
The influence of the Congress on a number of important literary
and political leaders appears to be very significant. This was
especially true in the case of Frenay and Silone, both of whom
under-went an apparent conversion due to the operations of the
Congress. On the other hand, the composition of the Congress
was unbalanced nationally and also because it was too leftist,
too radical.
C. The irritation caused by the Trevor-Roper article in the
Manchester Guardian was a reflection of the attitude of three
members of the british delegation, Trevor-Roper, ayer, and reter.
de Lendelssohn. etually, Kendelssohn (an old buddy of Lasky's)
was the cause of the trouble. He is a second-rate writer, a
neurotic, frustrated intellectual, who had a chip on his shoulder
and unquestionably inspired Trevor-Roper and yer with his spirit
of antagonism. Another complication was the fact that Ayer and
Koestler have been intellectual rivals and bitterly dislike each -
other. yer was infuriated by Koestler's prominence and commu-
nicated this antagonism to Trevor-Ropor. The letter is an exces-
sively conceited (Burnham added at this point that almost all
intellectuals are excessively conceited) and was openly annoyed
because he did not figure in the proceedings with sufficient prom-
inence. ("Incidentally," says Burnham, "Trevor-Roper's description
of Koestler as rootless European' follows Pravda, which uses
that term as a general description for Jews.") The annoyance felt
by Trevor-Roper and yer at their relegation to minor roles in
comparison to Ecestler found its outlet in articles which both of

these men have written, (Note: We have only seen the one by
Trevor-Roper.) and the situation was complicated by the desire
of Trevor-Roper to maintain a high and academic objectivity in
relation to world affairs, whereas the delegates to the Congrass
insisted on making it a realistic denunciation of the Communist
strangle-hold on culture and intellectual freedom. Koestler.
epitomizes the lofty philosophical viewpoint by saying, "Do you
want partial liberty or total slavery?" Lasky has written a
reply, over his name, to Trevor-Roper.
d. Melvin Lusky is granted the qualities of ability, courage,
hard work and political intuition but he is, at the same time,
the most vain and egocentric individual imaginable. In addition
to which, he is an intellectual snob, and a publicity hound. Also,
he definitely is not reliable, cannot be counted upon to do things
that he should do unless they work in with his own ideas. He has
the Russian Menshevik point of view which is simply that of useless
intrique for the sake of intrigue. His intellectual snobbery was
indicated in his process of meeting delegates. If they were very
important, he went to meet them with his personal car and driver--
along with newspaper photographers. If they were reasonably import-
ant, a private car was sent for them. If they were ordinary dele-
gates, they was given transportation on a bus. At least one dole-
Eate was contacted by Burnham and arrangements were made with Lasky.
to invite him, but no invitation was sent. In the case of Nax Yergin,
Lasky succeeded in miniliating him and in the case of Yakevlew,
Lasky at first refused to print his name on the program at all.
Lasky has done a wonderful job with Der Monet and there is no ques-
tion as to his natural ability and capacity for hard work but it
is difficult to see how he can be used in any outstanding position
in connection with a continuation of the Congress unless it is in
an advisory capacity, possibly in charge of the Serlin office and
with a strong hand subdue his self-advertising proclivities,

expressed spontaneously, in others drawn out by questions, and it is
new proposed to have a further meeting and ask him to talk about the
development potentialities and techniques.

MEMORANIUM FOR MESSRS. FRANK
SUBJECT:

LINDSAY
OFFIE
Project POQUICK
With reference to my conversation with Mr. Baker concern-
ing the project outline covering the subject project, I have approved
this project subject to the following condition. It makes no sense
to ze that we should state in paragraph 6 under the heading of security
that all practicable reasures will be taken to disguise the official
U. S. interest, financial and otherwise; and at the same time to pro-
vide that one of the two active sponsors will be Mr. Melvin J. Lasky,
editor of the overt HICOG monthly magazine "Der Monat.". I understand
that Mr. Lasky is needed as one of the principal organizers and opera-
tives but I think it quite unnecessary for his name to be flourished
about as a sponsor. After all, he is officially employed by HICOG--
he is, therefore, an acknowledged member of the U. S. apparatus in
Germany. Why then should his name be used? Reuter is an excellent
sponsor and surely it will be possible to find one or more others--
non-American or at least non-official American--to serve as sponsors.
2. Generally in the same connection I assume that our con-
sultant, Mr. Burnham, will operate in the wings and that his name
will not be too prominently displayed. As the result of his recent
book and the furer of communist commentary, he is a "sitting duck"
for hostile propagania in my opinion. I am entirely in favor of his
participating extensively in the arrangements, but the more his par-
ticipation can be in the form of "off-stage shispers" the better..

CISE
MR. SCHREYER, 3.
fo may 1958
Activities of Mr. Melvin Lasky in connection-with
Congress for Cultural Freedom (Project PDQUICK)
:1.
This is in response to your request that we examine our files and
submit a statement concerning the undue prominence given to Mr. Melvin
Lasky in connection with the Cultural Congress.
2. Lasky was publicly identified, early in the preparations for the
Congress, as the spark plug and leading light. This unsatisfactory position
was anticipated by Mr. Wiener, who, in his approval of Project PDQUICK,
cautioned against emphasis on Lasky's participation. (Attachment A).
:
3. From the beginning, the home office was cognizant of the danger of
a spotlight being thrown on any overt C. S. employee, and, in addition to.
previous warnings, on 7 April cabled specific instructions for the retire-
ment of Lasky to the background. This and other admonitions, from the home
office and the OPC German Mission chief, will be found at attachment B.
4. However, a review of the publicity which the Congress received
shows an unfortunate amount of concentration on Lasky. In Berlin, for in-
stance, where the Congress received its greatest publicity output, out of
180 newspaper clippings which are available, approximately 15 specifically
featured Lasky, some of them photographically. Of the U. S. and British
press clippings which were available, several featured Lasky prominently.
In a feature article in the New Leader, the subject of which was the
Cultural Congress, Lasky was referred to as the initiator of the Congress
and he was featured in at least two of the formal press releases which were
given out in Berlin. Of the 73 photographs which covered the Congress and
which were released for press and historical purposes, Lasky is prominently
featured in 6. (a large amount of this publicity material, including.
photographs, press cuttings and press releases, is available in our files.)
While Lasky's part as General Secretary was over-emphasized in a number of
newspapers and periodicals, the most damaging article appeared as a review
of the Congress in the Manchester Guardian, written by the prominent his-
torian, Mr. H. R. Trevor-Roper in which Lasky was described as connected
with American Information Services and the organizer of the Congress. The
statement was unfortunate because this was the only critical article of
the
Congress known to have appeared in the Western press. It passing, it
Eight be mentioned that the London Economist also picked up Lasky's appoint-
ment as General Secretary, as suggesting U. S. sponsorship. Its review, `.

b. The impact of the Congress on Berlin was terrific and
Router's part magnificent. The whole city was vory sager and
receptive and paid an extraordinary amount of attention to all
of the Congress activities. The book display at the Congress
itself was only fairly effective, but was extremely telling in
the book stores throughout Western sectors, which made special
displays of the bonics and photographs of the authors. Broad-
carting by radio HIAS seams to have been more or losa nominal,
al though RIS out tages of all of the Congress pooches, but the
Voice of Amerio team did a first-class and absolutely outstanding
job. The Congress is given big coverage by YON in several lan-
guages. In addition to the records of European publicity that
are on hand, a considerable additional amount was produced. For
instance, there was daily broadcasting of a Preach radio station
and sporadic broadcasting coverage by other stations. Thero unus
a large amount of ublicity in France and Eyland and a substan-
tial amount in Italy, Sondon and other countries. Special art-
ioles are still appearing in the European press and periodicals.
The influence of the Congress on a number of important literary
and political leaders appears to be very significant. This was
especially true in the case of Frenay and Silona, both of whom
under-went an apparent conversion due to the operations of the
Congress. On the other hand, the composition of the Congress
was unbalanced nationally and also because it was too leftist,
000 radical.
0. The irritation caused by the Trevor-Roper article in the
Manchester Guardian was a reflection of the attitude of three
members of the British delegation, Trevor-Roper, ayer, and Patare
de Mendelssohn. stually, Vandalssohn (an old buddy of Lasky's)
mus the use of the trouble. He is a second-rate writer, a
nourotic, frustrated intellectual, who had a chip on his shoulder
and unquestionably inspired Trevor-Roper and Ayor with his spirit
of antagonism. Another complication was the fact that Ayor and
Kesutler have been intellectual rivals and bitterly dislike each
other. Ayer was infuriated by Koestler's prominence and comPBLUE-
nicated this antugoniam to Trevor-Roper. The 1sttor is an exes-
sively conceited man (Burnham added at this point that almost all
intellectuals are excessivaly mesited) and was openly annoyed
because he did not figure in the proceedings with sufficient prom
inence. (Incidentally," says Burnham, "Trevor-Roper's description
of Koestler as a 'rootless European' follows Pravda, which uses
that tom as a general description for lows.") The annoyance felt.
by Trevor Roper and Ayor at their relegation to minor roles in
comparison to Koestler found its outlet in artiolos which both of

however, was laudatory and pointed up the sincerity and usefulness of the
gathering. The holding of the Congress in Berlin was described as "a
gesture of defiance"; the meeting was called an event of "considerable sig-
nificance (strong words for the London Economist) and it was referred to
as marking, or at least reflecting "a turning point of the western counter-
attack in the cold war." *Korea," said the Ecchomish, made the fortune
of the Congress and crystallized the real issue before the delegates."
Trevor-Ecper, in a letter to the Economist, commenting on its article, was
ruch more temperate than in his article in the Guardian. For example,
in the Economist he declared, "We were almost all united against Communism
from the start.
3.
5. At this point, it should be specified that from the time the Con-
gress was first discussed, it was recognized that the Communist presse
would indict it as a fascist, war mongering, propaganda group operating under
the intelligence auspices of the C. S. and that this accusation would be
broadcast by the Communist machine (as it was) whether or not, in fact the
Congress had been under any external controls. It was also recognised that
the General Secretary of the Congress would inevitably receive a certain
amount of attention from the press. It seems to be clear, however, that this
amount of attention was unnecessarily large.
6. Notwithstanding the undue personal publicity achieved by Mr. Lasky,
it is significant that:
a. He played a most important role in the conception, develop-
ment, organization and control of the Congress. Without his active
interest and support the launching of the Congress would have been
most difficult.
b. The Congress was a highly successful operation. In its stand
against intellectual neutrality in the struggle against Communism,
its Letter to the East," its final "Kanifesto," and its deliberations
and intellectual discussions, the Congress has proven its propaganda.

future.

Ref. PD QUICK
The decision on this is not up to me. I will appreciate
opportunity to discuss it with you.
My point of view is that ALL of this current PAQUICK stuff
is premature and a case of a lot of hungry actors smelling
easy money and wanting to get into the aot and get the show on
the road.
We have no budget for PDQUICK for this period - and literally.
are living on borrowed funds. We can't make up a budget because
we have no accounting from the field, do not know where we stand.
Here are some other questions in my mind:
What wore the publicity accomplishments of the relatively
expensive NY office?.
What happened to the Berlin news coverage by US correspondents?
What happened to the bright and sanguinary forecasts of
tremendous amounts of publicity, special magazine articles, radio
broadcasts, etc. which were to emanate from the attendance at the
Congress of Messrs. Montgomery and Conant - a little matter
which cost the US about two thousand pieces of Ettuse ?
clear that their attendance was absolutely worthless otherwise.)
What happened to their efforts to obtain delegates from
the Middle East?

Why did Lasky proceed with a dozen last minite invitations

extremely important people) including several wives.

display was an expensive item. Did it take place?
This book
Now with all these questions in my mind, adding up to a
realisation that if the Congress was a success, it was only a
'
suocess as far as it went, and it has a long way to go to completely
the next steps NOT being spending a lot of dough for
the support of deserving intellectuals who have no other source of thoome,
but in getting a distribution of a million pieces of literature, and
other publicity, in Satellite areas - I would hesitate (which is
->
a euphemism for blankly object) to blandly appropriating an extra
ten thousand bucks to support an innocuous group of Russian exiles who
want to air their grievances, NOT under our control.

g. Yo think that it need not cost more than $25,000 for

administration, traveling expenses, including the salaries of
personnel, which would assume a General Secretary who would
be an agent. (This latter concept may not be absolutely
necessary; but if not, then provision should be made for OFC
contact some other way.) In addition to the $25,000. speci-
fied above, there should be an allotment of $50,000 for the
holding of the next Congress. Another $25,000 should be
added for special purposes largely connected with publicity.
The major part of the expenditures for the next year for
collection, printing, and dissemination of Congress material
and which could conceivably amount to as much as $250,000 as
a top figure, would be provided, it is hoped, by PCA funds.
b. The activities mentioned in Part II of subject report
could very well be handled under the setup outlined abovo
with certain exceptions which seem to be too broad in scope
to be justified at all.

were unable to come. Their names would be most useful in the Congress'

Charlos Olmstead
Confidential Report Received By Schiller on
Berlin Congress for Cultural Froodom
-
1. When Mr. Stribling's shop requested me, at the behest of
a cable request of Mr. Hambley, to attempt to appease Schiller in
connection with his indignation for the manner in which Nax Yergin,
the American Negro, had been handled in Berlin, Schiller reacted in
the manner described in my earlier memorandum on this subject, which
was on the whole satisfactory. He has since received a complete re-
nort from a reliable and competent observer at the Berlin Congress
which I am quoting below:
"On the whole, the Congress has achieved some useful results.
In my opinion, the best thing about the Congress was that it was
held in Berlin. A Congress in Faris, in Switzerland or in any
other place would have had neither the same political significance
For the Berlinero,
nor would it have received the same publicity.
the fact that Berlin was chosen as the meeting place was reneved
proof of Western solidarity with their resistance against the
Russians. They noad such prent again and again, especially in
view of the fact that they have a definite and justified impression
that the Bonn Government is not inclined to manifest any particular
fervor as far as help for the Berlin pepulation is concerned.
"The Congress, moreover has been a success inasmuch as it
showed the determination of an important group of intellectuals,
scholars, and artiststo leave no longer unchallenged Communist
attempts to dominate the scene through their various "cultural"
front organisations. The permanent machinery established by the
Congress for the purpose of continuing its work may be of great
importance provided that certain conditions are observed in its
activities.
☐
"The following critical remarks regarding certain phases and
features of the work of the Congress should not be construed as an
attempt to deny the fact that the Congress has achieved a useful
purpose. Nor is this criticis made from a perfectionist point of
view. However, while it is sdnitted that in a gathering of artists,
scholars, and writers, many of whom tend to display prima-donna
attitudes and a spirit of coterie, a certain amount of friction
is inevitable, it cannot be said that everything was done to reduce
such frictions to a minimum. As a result, many delegates when I
had an opportunity to ask for their impressions of the Congress,
left Berlin with mixed feelings, some of them not without a certain
amount of disappointment.

"At a certain moment, the debates tocka very unfortunate
On one of the frequent occasions, when Koestler was given
the floor, ho read a paper wherein he attacked Socialism in
general and the British Labor Government in particular. Considering
1) that about 70% of the delegates vero poople who professed
socialist opinions; 2) that the purpose of the Congress required
that a unity of all democratic intellectuals, both socialists and
non-socialists in the struggle against totalitarianism be emphasized
and 3) that the chairman of the Congress was met Reuter, head of
the social-democratic city government of Berlin -- Koestler's attack
was absolutely out of place and should not have been made regardless
of whether he was right or not. As a matter of fact, the paper in
question proved that Koestler is mistaken in assuming that a brilliant
journalist and a successful novelist is so ipso qualified to play the
role of a philosopher, historian and sociologist. In addition,
mistaken statements by British Labor regarding the problem of
European unity do not justify in my opinion the kind of vitriolic
all-out attack against the British Labor Government which was made
by Koestler who seems to have forgotten, that, regardless, what one
may think of some of its policies, British Labor is today one of the
principal pillars of the world democratic front.
"Evidently Kcentler's attack provoked immediate reaction on the
part of the Socialist Congress delegates, beginning with Router who
was in the chair. In my opinion, this entire discussion was completoly
unnecessary. The British conservative N. P., Amery, showed much
better judgment than Koestler by studiedly avoiding in his pronounce-
ments, any criticism of the Labor Government. If an attitudo oimilar
to that of Koestler would have been adopted in the trade union field,
the I.C.F.F.U. could not have been created. As in the labor movement,
the organization of intellectuals for the defense of democracy cannot
be successful unless it is understood that democratic socialism is a
powerful influence among the best intellectuals of Europe and Asia
and that, therefore, everything should be done to secure cooperation
of all democratic forces in spite of all ideological differences. I
was rather astonished to find that Irving seemed to like Koestler's
discourse on socialism. I spoke with quite a number of delegates and
found that they didn't like it at all.
"Instead of appointing on the first and second days of the Congress
a resolution Committed which would have been able to work seriously
on any draft resolutions, proposals and suggestions made by the
delegates, a draft manifesto and draft resolution were submitted to a
plenary meeting which had to decide on them within a few hours. That
meeting appointed some committees who had exactly one hour's time to
amend the resolutions. Of course, no serious work of re-writing and
completing the resolutions could be done under such circumstances.
You will notice that the manifesto treats the question of cultural
freedom principally from the point of view of the journalist and less
from that of the scholar and the artists. At least this is my opinion.
A draft appeal to the intellectuals behind the Iron Curtain, which wẠO
submitted by Skeggs, evoked an immediate sharp criticism on the part of
SECRET

14-00000
"While, the organisation of the Congress was excellent no far.
as the technical side was concerned, (hotela, public motings,
receptions, press interviews, etc.), the debatos of the Congress
took place under conditions which shoved a considerable lack of
imagination and ignorance of parliamentary procedure on the part
of those responsible for the way in which the business of the
Congress was transacted, Skeggo. Muhlen, and Hondy are certainly
nice follows with the best intentions. However, they seem to .
have had no previous experience at all how to run a conference.
"All delegates had been asked to prepare papers on various
subjects. It was obviously impossible to have all those papers
rend in the public meetings of the Congress (they were mimeographed
and will be distributed). It was necessary to make a selection of
topics and speakers. The best method would have been to appoint a
steering committee which would have made this necessary selection
with the maximum of objectivity. Unfortunately, this was not done.
Instead, the question of who was to speak ari how long was decided
by Skeggs and his associates who did it in a rather arbitrary and
haphazard manner. To explain what I mean let me cite a few examples;
First, the case of our friend, Max Yergin. Together with Max we
worked rather hard on his paper (one night we had no more than two
hours sleep). The final product received rather favorable comments
from Hambley and Arthur 3chlesinger ✓ I tried to make Skeggs under-
stand the importance of having Communist propaganda regarding the
Eegro problem answered and refuted by a competent person who is a
Negro himself. Skegge first promised me that Yergin would have
fifteen minutos speaking time. When we arrived at the meeting where
Nax was scheduled to speak, he was told that he would not get more
than ten minutes. We went to work again, and deleted some passagus
so as to have a ten-minute text. However, when Max was about to
take the floor, he was informed by Bondy that he should not speak
longer than five minutes. As a result, Max got confused and delivered
a completely inadequate version of what he originally wanted to say. _
Similarly, Sascha Schwars was prevented from making a report on the
situation of the working class in Russia. Nor did the delegate from
Spain and the one and only representative of Latin-America to the
Congress have a chance to speak.
"On the other hand, Koestler spoke four or five times and there
was generally a marked tendency to build him up as a kind of praeceptor
Fundi. He seems to have enjoyed himself in the role of a task-master
censoring and lecturing the delegatos. As far as I gathered from a
conversation with Skeggs, Koestler was given this prominent place
because, due to the fact that as a well-known writer, his pronounce<
ments were supposed to attract public attention in a greater measure
than speeches by other delegates. The same consideration was evidently
applied in the case of Silone. However, Silone seemed to be anxious
to be as non-committal as possible, quite in line with his ambiguous
political attitude. While Skeggs' preoccupation with problems of
publicity is understandable. I do not think that the method of treating
authore according to the sales of their books is apt to promote a
lasting cooperation among writers, scholars, etc. For once, scholars
will never be able to sell as many copies of their books as Koestler.

-O
the Folish and Russian delegates.
The committee on which they
were represented, amended it. However, later on not the amended
text which was adopted by the Congress but the original draft was
released to the press, thus cresting additional resentment.
"Yergin was not in a happy nood when he left. A public
meeting had been arranged for his and Schyler where they read their
papers in full. However, they did not like the way they were
treated insofar as speaking time at the Congress meetings was
concerned and Nex made remarks to the effect that now the Communiste
will say they had been jim-crowed since they had to present their
case in a special mosting. They also resented the fact that the
permanent committee elected by the Congress does not contain any
representative of the colored race. It would, of course, have been
difficult to appoint one of them to the committee since the representa-
tion of the United States was limited on purpose so as to to create
the impression of American domination. However, the right of cooptation
granted by the Congress to the permanent committes should be used to
introduce as soon as possible in the committee intellectuals from
India, Japan and other non-white areas.
Sone of the papers read at the Congress were excellent, for
Instance those of Prof. Muller (Schiller's men) and Arthur Schlesinger
to name only a few. As far as the future work of the movemcht
initiated by the Congress is concerned, certain things should be
taken into account to make possible the full use of existing possibili-
ties which are quite favorable. 1) Representatives of Asia and
possibly Africa should be drawn into the work of the committee.
2) All due respect for literary fame, the organs of the new movement
should not become a platform for the peculiar ambitions of certain
individuals whatever their gifts and talents. 3') While among the
intellectuals it will probably be impossible to avoid discussion
of so-called ideological problems, the purpose of such discussions
should not be the struggle of rival ideologies, but the finding out
of the points and areas where advocates of different ideologies may
meet for cooperation in the defense of democracy against totalitar-
ianism. 4) Establishment of contacts with other movements engaged
In the struggle against totalitarianism, especially in the labor
movement. 5) Eetter organization of the work of future congresses
and conferences.
"The Congress undoubtedly reflected the progress made during the
last year as for as the attitude of European intellectuals in concerned..
There is no trace of neutralistic attitudes in the resolutions of the
Congress. The same cannot be said of all the speeches. However, no
openly neutralistic speech was made at the Congress. The only paper
advocating a neutraliet attitude was withdrawn by its author, the
Austrian physicist, Thyrring, when he heard of the Russian attack on
Southern Korea. Ivouldn't say that people like Rousset and especially
Silone are quite clear about the present world situation, particularly
na farino military defense against iussiania concerned, hatever, they
whuely refrained from any openly neutralistic statements.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Kessus. Thompson and Glazer
FRCH:
SUBJECT:
Charles Olstead D.
Berlin Intellectual Congress
1. I wish to refer to Mr. Glaser's informal menorundum with
regard to the mishandling of the American Negro, Max Iergin, at
the Berlin Intellectual Congress.
2. When I informed Schiller that I wished to discuss this
matter with him he proceeded to read to be a letter which he had
just received from Berlin giving a rather full report on the .
Berlin Congress and with contained a great deal of information.
Among the items reported on therein was the incident regarding
Max Yergin. I explained to Scallier that it was a most difficult.
task to control the group of assorted Europeans who attended the
Berlin Congress and suficient time was not given, therefore, to
United States delegates, but that Yergin's excellent speech, which
had been cut off the radio at the microphone, was being widely
used in press, radio, bock and pamphlet form.
4114
3. Schiller accepted this explanation, but in closing our
discussion of this subject, wise-cracked that our boys in Berlin
did not include Yergin on any social doings and closed his remarks
with the statement that "even intellectuals like Burnnas, don't like
to sit down and eat with Negroes." I cnided him briefly and there
the matter was closed.

on this factor. Stated further that he knew him as a very brilliant
writer. With reference to his political idealism, Loops stated that
he believed he was a Socialist and a little to the left; however, this
factor was temperate with the statement that with regard to Fascist
or Communist, he was definitely anti-Nazi and he believed that he was
anti-Communist. He continued by saying that he was a man of high
character and that he personally liked him but that he would not consider
him for an executive secretary's position. With further reference to
the last point, he mentioned that he was basing this on the fact that
he did not know of any executive position that the individual had held.

A cable from Jim Burnham, states that act Yergin was
not satisfied with the way ho was handlod at the Cultural Con 2033
in Dorlin.
His complaints:
His spooch
-
described as "oxcollont" - was cut
off at the microphone.
Ho did not, apparently, receive the kind of
attention he thought was due him.
He is expected to make an adverse report to Schiller.
Burnham would like offio to apponse Schiller by assuring him
that the staff of the Congress had their hands full trying to
control the bunch of aorted opens thero, and could
not give sufficient Lime and attention to delegates.
And that they intond to us Yorgin's excellent material in
press, radio, book and pamphlet form, giving it wido
distribution. In comparison to this, Dunham considors
the actual promulgation at the sessions of the Congress
a minor mattor..

Dear Colonel Glaser:
Walter Hehring finally got off last night. There was no room on
Saturday's plane for which he stood by, but he was scheduled to take a
Sunday morning plane. Due to some mechanical difficulty, that plane did
not leave until last night. The American Express Co. was unofficially
informed that as a result of President Truman's intervention all other
_ planes were chartered for the stranded students. I even spoke to Er.
Buttles about getting Mr. Mehring on one of the chartered planes if
the scheduled flight did not get off last night. If Mehring, too, did
not turn up our counter-Grosz campaign would have looked bad. I therefore
felt that he mistleave even if it meant being present at only part of the
Congress.
i
I received a letter from George Grosz which I requested when I spoke
to irs. Grosz:
} "Here is my statement:
I regret not to be able to attend the Congress for Cultural Freedom. My
reasons are entirely personal. I am delighted with your efforts to mobilize
Art and scientists of the world for Freedom and Peace."
I cabled the text of the statement, signed with his name, to Berlin;
and airmailed the letter and envelope to them.
Unfortunately Middleton of the Times is on vacation from Berlin. We
seem to be getting better coverage in the Herald-Tribune, which has a by-
line correspondent on the job.
Adolph Berle, as Chairman of the Liberal Party, cabled greetings to
the Congress.
If anything goes wrong with the fruit crop in Berlin or anyplace in
Europe for that matter, they'll probably blame it on Kuller's fruit flies
Sincerely
Kluger

Dear Mr. Williams:
Re: CONGRESS FOR CULTURAL FREEDOM
Mr. Elliot Cohen, Editor
Commentary Napazinos
On May 22 the Foreign Service Educational Foundation authorized American
Express to provide round trip transportation between New York City and
Berlin to Mr. Cohen. The delegate advised us that air transportation
would be unacceptable and that, because of commitments in New York, the
only steamship sailing to which he could agree was the S. S. QUEEN ELIZA
BETH due to leave New York after last midnight.
Space on wastbound sailings at this season is at a premium, and on this
particular one has been sold out for a considerable time, being actually
under ticket. We exerted our best efforts in behalf of Mr. Cohen, but
were unable to come up with the desired space. Mr. Cohen, on the recon-
mendation of the line, we understand, attended the departure of the ship
in the event that a passenger would be unable to sail and space be made
available at the last moment.
An odd berth did become available in this manner and it was allotted to
Mr. Cohen. The passenger borrowed from recomodating friends and made
payment directly to the line. Will you authorize us to reimburse Mr.
Cohen for funds he expended for his eastbound passage?
It would be of great assistance if we could have your reply on Monday..
Sincerely yours,,

(1) It is conceivable that there adst photos of crowds being fired
upon in Nov.-Jan. 1919-1913, in connection with rioting on the dissolution
of the Constituent Assembly. (See Shub's Lenin)..
(2) Fighting in Moscow, Nov. 1917 (There was no fighting in Petersburg).
(3) Collectivization. Soup think it is conceivable there codist

McKnight and Buttles agreed that Lasky should be

Neilson who is returning to Faris tonight,
Neilson added he would like to get together with Cody and
other state people in Paris.

of what to
Mr. McKnight stated that the meeting had been called to
discuss ways and means of taking advantage of the Cultural
Congress in Berlin by widespread dissemination of the
product of the Congress, speeches, declarations, etc.
Why would it not be a good idea to have Buttles communicate
with Lasky and have latter send the material to Paris
for publication in France, as well as here..

Mr. Neilson (ECA) said that speaking for ECA, they have
a liberal view as to spending ECA funds and are anxious to
cooperate with state, subject to limitations which are s
relevant to present cese, which are (a) expenditure to
be approved on a project basis (b) a finger to be kept
on the progrees of expenditure (c) within certain totale

instance, no large gobe of ECA money to send US symphony
orchestras touring through Europe.) Said Mr. Neilson, the
Cultural Congress would fall within the zone of
probable acceptability and should be a cooperative
enterprise with State, to be cleared with ECA financial
and legal advisors, but do not anticipate difficulty
because the Cultural Congress is clearly related to the
approved ECA policy of countering the Soviet peace offensive.
Mr. Buttles suggested that the best thing to do with
product of Congress was to get local people to publish it;

Dear Jim,
Thanks for letter of the 6th. Good to know that you
and Marcia are due here so nice and early. Four more shoulders
on which to unload the awful burden of this hard world.
What's this about not accepting the brilliant Aron-
Koestler-Burnham Memo? That is now our working gospel. The
International Committee lives on? No, no. It's been killed, it's
dead. The five philosophers reign. The alphabetical order has
come into new glory. Under separate cover you will receive the
latest news from A to Z. New Correspondence paper is being
_ printed. The program of the Congress will be the revised printed
booklet which you already have.
together
As for the names, pretty kettle of fish you chaps fished
e extended invitations. A few came up with affirm
atives. Ayer from England, etc.
End, etc. Also Jules Romains, Now that
he's coming, Koestler via telephone yesterday - says, oh,
oh. Well, why in the world was he put on the list when he's
so wishy-washy? You can't have him without letting him speak.
And he's tentatively scheduled for about 10 minutes on the open-
ing Monday orogram. Also, by the way, Koestler informed he won't
be able to turn up even for a day before the Congress. I am
writing today to ask him to plan a short opening address to round
off the somewhat too ceremonial opening program with a political-
keynoting speech. You might write him too, if it won't be over-
doing it.
Also under separate cover, some papers that we have been
sending out.

McKnight then asked me if CIA was interested in the propo-
sition as a whole. I replied it seemed very interesting.
He then said if a conference was arranged in Paris would we
like to have a CIA representative there, I answered I
thought we might like to have someone. I then asked
Buttles if he was sure Lasky would go to Faris Buttles

That ECA is willing to provide funds for production or
a million copies of the speeches of the Congress and other
publicity. Neilson said that labor committees and
other cooperative groups might be used for dissemination.
However, the greatest caution must be exercised to see that
'a committee on publications, or words to that effect, is
appointed during the sessions of the Congress, and in my
opinion it should be an unwitting group, except for one
member; it should NOT have more than one US representative.
It MIGHT be entirely German. Again it looks as though Lasky
might have to be the secretary of such a group. I think :
all they have to do is start a quick 'fund raising campaign'
for publications and won't they be surprised at the

Contact with Burnham. In reply to my suggestion that I stop
in New York. Sat. morning to see him, discuss Congress affairs and
deliver a pistol, Burnham replied that he was leaving this
afternoon for his camp in Connecticut, would not return until
Saturday night, was flying on Sunday morning. He suggested that
there was little necessity for additional discussion of the
Congress, that if any papers or articles (the pistol) were to
be delivered to him, they could be sent by mail or otherwise
to his NY address, care of Irs. Claude Burnham, 3 69 St.,

(Dmpossible, I think, to anticipate decisions now as they would
depend on success of Congress in attracting world publicity,
furnishing base for Riding continuing propaganda and
arousing communist opposition.)

status vis-a-vis CIA. This on the theory that whether or not Mrs.

necessary because of services she will be expected to render, and
also because her presence will protect her husband's cover. The

(1) Photos of crowds being fired upon during rioting, Nov. Jan. 1918,
in connection with the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly.
Page 282 of Lenin by David Shib says: "The Assembly was scheduled
to open on the morning of Jamiary 18, 1918. In anticipation of the long-
awaited event, Lenin ordered a detachment of Lettish sharpshooters to
PET OG AD (St. Petersburg,
Petersburg, now: Leningrad; might be atated under any
of these names in Graphics files?).
(2) Fighting in Moscow, Nov. 1917. (There was no fighting in
Petrograd, he says).
(3) Photos of peasants being shipped north to Siberia during
Collectivization. Some think it "coosivable" they may codst.
That would be around 1932, 1931 I guess.
He suggests trying:

2. LIBRARY OF CONGRES3.
You could ask Chuck Vetter whother he could arrange for you, without
too much trouble to get into the place and borrow any photos they have
in the name of CIA, for a month or a couple of weeks (longar, if possible of
course) for our man to make copies of.

Bericht Nr.12.
Die Veranstaltungen im Haus der Kultur der S.U. zeigen eine
aufsteigende Linie. Den Gästen wird ein immer vielseitigeros Prom
gramm dargeboten. Immer mehr Besucher, davon viel Stammgäste, stela
len sich ein. Damit steigt auch die äirkung, der Einfluß im Sinne
der sowjetischen Gastgeber bei deutschen breiten Volkamassen.
Anläßlich des dreijährigen Bestehens des baudes gab die Gem
schäftsführung auf großen dekorativen Wandtafeln bekannt, daß 1947
105 Vorträge stattfanden; 1948 waren es 197 und 1949 schon 328 ge=
worden. Gegenwärtig gibt es in einer Woche mitunter etwa zehn Vor-
träge, meist mit anschließendem Film, daneben zahlreiche musika-
lische und künstlerische Vorstellungen und die eigentlichen Filme,
im Monat annähernd zehn verschiedene. Berücksichtigt man dazu noch
die ständigen Ausstellungen, die stets lebhaft besucht werden, und
häufige festliche Versammlungen, so kann man schätzen, daß mindes-
tens zweitausend Menschen täglich (mit Ausnahme eines Ruhetages
in jeder mocher) das Haus der Kultur betreten. Sie werden auch
durch die repräsentative äußere Aufmachung und die kostenlose
Betreuung beeindruckt. Solche Mäume kennen manche (wohl die meis⑉
ten) Besucher nur aus Film oder Bildern, und auf seidendamast-
bespannte Polstermöbel aus Schloß Sanssouci können sie sich sonst
auch nicht setzen.
Die Vorträge kann man ihrem Inhalt nach in einige Kategorien
aufteilen. Da gibt es solche, die das Grundsätzliche und Dogma-
tische der Partellehre erläutern. Hierzu gehört etwa "Die marxist
tisch-leninistische Lehre vom Staat" oder "Klassen und Klassen-
kampf" oder "Materialismus oder Idealismus"; ferner Vortragsreihen
über Lenins berke oder über die Geschichte der Partel der Bolschem
wiki.
Andere Vorträge haben außenpolitische Fragen zum Gegenstand
z. B. ein Vortragszyklus über die Außenpolitik der USSR, ferner
über den "Sieg der Volkskräfte in China", über den "Freiheits=
kampf der kolonialen Völker" oder die "Hintergründe der amerika=
nischen Außenpolitik“.
Weitaus die meisten Vorträge befassen sich mit inneren Zu-
ständen der UdSSR. Es ist selbstverständlich, daß alle Einrich-
tungen der Sowjetunion im günstigsten Lichte dargestellt werden.
Der Hörer erfährt von Macht und Reichtum, Fortschritt und Rekor=
dem der Sowjetunion und von den vorbildlichen Leistungen ihrer
Einwohner. Einige charakteristische Themen lauteten: "Boden"
schätze der S.U.", "Der Nachkriegs-Finfjahrplan", die "Stachanows

Berlin ist (laut Roenen) #1 der Mittelpunkt nicht nur Deutsch-
lands, sondern des Blocks her Volksdemokratien und ganz Europas!
Ohne Berlin kein Friede, keine "Freiheit", keine Einheit Deutsch-
lands. Der jetzige Zustand, da3 Westberlin sich dem Herrschafts
anspruch der "nationalen Front" entzieht, muß beseitigt werden.
Stwa die zweite Hälfte des Koenenschen Vortrags beschäftigte
sich mit den Vorgängen bei der Demontage in Fatenstedt-Salzgitter
und enthielt drastische Kommentare zu den Pressenachrichten der
letzten Tage. Koenen schilderte den erfolgreichen Biderstand der
deutschen Arbeiterschaft gegen die Zerstörung ihrer Arbeitsstätten,
gegen aggressive Pläne der Westalliierten. Am Schluß des Vortrags
meldete sich zur Diskussion nur ein Mann aus den Publikua mit dem
Vorschlag, der Belegschaft in tenstedt Salzgitter die Sympathie
aller Versammelten telegraphisch auszusprechen. Die Resolution
wurde in Abstimmung einstimmig angenommen..

Über die
Nationale Front" des "demokratischen".
Deutschlands in Tageskampf sprach Wilhelm Koenen am 16.3.50.
im Haus der Kultur der S.U. Der Theaterrraum war voll; viel Poli=
zisten als Zuhörer. Koenen, prominenter SED-Bonze linientreuer
Mann des "Volksrata", ist ein typischer Agitator und Demagoge.
Er spricht mit lauter, geschulter Stimme, lebhaft und einprägsam.
Dabei reiht er Phrasen und Schlagworte aneinander, ohne eigene
Ideen zu entwickeln. Aber der kritika und urteilslose Hörer erliegt
leicht seinem Wortschwall. Scharf und heftig sind seine Ausfälle.
Adenauer ist der "skrupellose Vertreter amerikanischer Monopolinter=
essen" und nebenbei ein Schwager zweiten Grades von Mac
Cloy" und hat Westdeutschland leichtsinnigerweise mit mindestens
35 Milliarden Westmark Schulden belastet, während die "Deutsche
Demokratische Republik schuldenfrei dasteht. Elend, Verfall und
Hoffnungslosigkeit herrschen in Westdeutschland. "Bei uns (d.h. im
glücklichen östlichen Teil Deutschlands) geht es schrittweise vor-
an, während es im kolonialen Deutschland (gemeint ist der Westen)
sprungweise zurückgeht!”, rief Koenen aus
:
R
Der Redner forderte, daß die politische Agitation in g an z
Berlin sowie in der Ostzone planmäßig verstärkt werden solle. Über-
all sollen Agitationstrupps geschult werden. Sie sollen z.B. in
kleinen Gruppen in den Berliner Sm und U-Bahnen durch laute Ge=
spräche im Sinne der "nationalen Front" die Öffentlichkeit "auf=
klären". Im Ostsektor und in der Ostzone sollen sie Verständnis
wecken für die (von der SED und ihren Auftraggebern) geforderte
vorfristige Erfüllung des Zweijahrplanes sowie für ein neues Ge=
setz, das die Ablieferungspflicht der Landwirtschaft erhöht. Auch
das Einsammeln von "Buntmetallen" soll durch die politische Orga=
nisation bis herunter zu den Hausobleuten gründlicher betrieben
werden. Daneben soll die "Wachsamkeit" (auch ein Wort typisch mos=
kauer Prägung) gegenüber den Lauen und widerspenstigen verschärft
werden. Zur Erläuterung, wie und wo die Gefahr von "Saboteuren"
droht, wurde anschließend der Defa-Film "Der Auftrag Hoegners", der
schon oft im Hause gelaufen ist, nochmals gezeigt.
Die deutsche Bevölkerung steht, wie Koeren ausführte, vor ela
nem entscheidenden inneren Kampfubschnitt. Es gilt, die Schranken
zu beseitigen, welche die "nationale Front" noch von ihrem Ziel
trennen, ihre Grundsätze auf ganz Deutschland auszudehnen. In die-
som Sinne soll das Fringstreffen der deutschen Jugend zu mehr als
einer Demonstration werden. Ganz Barlin soll damit gewonnen werden.

Bewegung" und "Der Flan sur Dwandlung der Natur". Auch über den
"Lebensstandard der Werktätigen" wird berichtet, über den Staats-
haushalt der UdSSR, her Volksbildung, Sport. Leben der Frauen
und dergleichen mehr. Das Programm ist vielseitig und findet
immer eine interessierte Hörergemeinschaft.
Hieran reihen sich auch deutsche Themen. Während die vorge
nannten Vorträge vorwiegend von sowjetischen Offizieren oder
Funktionären gehalten werden, holt man zur Behandlung der Deutsch-
land betreffenden Fragen meist "prominente"" Persönlichkeiten
der S.E.D. und der ostdeutschen Regierung oder solche, die he=
kanntermaßen mit deren Ideen sympathisleren (s.b. Minister Rau,
Próf. Gerhart Eisler, Dr. Kurt Fischer, Wilhelm Koenen, Arnold
Zweig u.§.w.). Gegenwärtig steht die Politik der "nationalen
Front" im Vordergrund. Soweit Musik von hervorragender Qualität
geboten wird, ist sie meist auf die gleiche politische Tendenz
abgestimmt. Auch den verschiedenen volksdemokratischen Ländern.
sind bestimmte Vorträge und Filme gewidmet.
Ausstellungen
Die
gehen ständig nebenher.
Jetzt gibt es u.a. eine solche über sowjetische Architektur,
die
meisterhafte Riesenphotos der größten und schönsten modernen
Bauten der USSR enthält, Regierungspaläste, Theater, Arbeiter
großwohnhäuser, Sanstorien, Bahn- und Hafengebäude, Farks.
Eine über die sowjetische Armee steht vor der Eröffnung.
Andere Ausstellungen zeigten oder zeigen Leistungen der sowjeti=
schen Malerei, Graphik, Flakatkunst, Bücher und Kinderbücher,
Bühnenbilder, Material zum Leben von Lenin, Stalin, Gorki und
Puschkin, Filmwesen, 800 Jahre Moskau, Fünfjahrplan, Geschichte
der kommunistischen Fartei und Kampf um den Frieden u. dgl
Stets gewinnt man den Eindruck, daß der Betrieb im Hause
mit Hilfe reichlichen Fersonals sorgfältig organisiert ist.

das Bollwerk des Friedens
Die Sowjetarme e
und der Sicherheit in der ganzen Welt •
1st das ctto. einer Ausstellung, die am 17.3.50. im Haus der
Kultur der Sowjetunion eröffnet wurde.
In einer blumengeschmückten Vorhalle; und drei Räumen sieht
man Bilder, Landkarten mit Erläuterungen und großplakatierte
Zitate. Das ganze könnte man als einen kriegsgeschichtlichen
Schnellkursus der sowjetischen Armee bezeichnen. Waffen, Unifor-
men und dergleichen, was sonst in Heeresmussen zu finden ist,
werden hier nicht gezeigt. Auch technisch ist über den heutigen
Stand der Armee nichts Neues zu entnehmen. Die Ausstellung trägt
mehr ideologischen Charakter und eine bestimmte politische Ten-
deng. Die äußere Ausstattung ist dekorativ sehr sorgfältig und
Künstlerisch gemacht.
Die Bilder beginnen zeitlich mit Gemälden aus der Revolutions=
zeit im Oktober 1917, als die ersten Trupps bewaffneter Arbeiter
sich zur "Roten Garde" zusammenschlossen. Stets stehen schon hier
Lenin und Stalin Seite an Seite.
Auf mehreren Landkarten werden sodann die Feldzüge des Bürger-
krieges illustriert, in deren Verlauf die Rote Armee nacheinander
die fremden Invasionstruppen sowie ihre inneren weiß-russischen
Gegner besiegte. Von kärz bis Oktober 1819 ging es gegen die von
Osten anrückenden Truppen Koltschaks, nachdem schon 1918 briti=
sche Expeditionstruppen von Murmansk aus vergeblich ins Land ein-
zudringen versucht hatten. Bedrohlicher für die junge, Sowjet=
macht wurden damals (1919/20) die Vorstöße Denekins von Süden her,
die jedoch Ende 1920 mit einem vollen Sieg der Roten Armee und
Vertreibung der Gegner aus der Krim endeten. Auch des polnischen
Angriffs erwehrte sich die Rote Armee. Schließlich gelang es
1hr auch, in Kämpfen, die sich bis Oktober 1922 hinzogen, ihre
Macht von Irkutsk bis Fladiwostok im Fernen Osten wiederherzustel=
len. Die Rolle Stalins bei der Leitung dieser Unternehmen wird
besonders hervorgehoben. Eine auf einem großen Tisch montierte
Kartenskizze zeigt z. B. durch Fähnchen und Daten Stalins Fahrten
durch das ausgedehnte Operationsgebiet zwischen Nordrußland und
Kaukasus.
Der größte Raum wird durch Bilder aus dem letzten Krieg gefüllt.
Darunter ist kaum Material, das nicht schon durch Zeitschriften
früher bekannt geworden wäre. Wieder zeigen große Lage- und
Bewegungs-Skizzen die Zerschlagung der Hitler-Armeen in groß=

18 May 1951
A thorough review of the whole set-up. Munson stressed two points:
(1) "The book must be locked up by July 21." Otherwise it couldn't be
printed in September. And in that case it might be necessary to wait till
about next March.
(2) "It mist bex the sort of book that Doubleday might be putting out.
Firstly, because if it is "tɔ̃o propagandistic" the rotallers just won't, handle
it (cf details re C,Zoo). Secondly, "Swen is still secure, stands up woll under
Dun & Bradstreet examination, and has been a great success in the FE. It has
the NY reputation of a Far Eastern firm which does unusual things in the US.
Swen as a going concern is more important than any one book: the book shouldn't
be allowed to jeopardize Swen by being too obviously propaganda.",
_ I returned the layout to him. (He has not seen the text, either, nor I think
the other 60-old pages). He doesn't plan to tell' Shub we've seen it. He
recommended that we give Shib another wook to continue on it. Then that,
about Monday, May 28, Sims and/or Bryan go down to MY for 2 or 3 days and
work with Shub on it..
NB: He said that, later, it might be possible for Shub to introduce me
to his collaborator as an informal consultant whom he'd called in. In other
words, in attempting to sell our views of it to Shub, wo have also the problem
of whether Shub could sell them in turn to his collaborator. and Security.
both gave our view of the book at length.
Lyle's views included: that with the text it may be better than it looks;
that theress 66 pages to come; that it is better to get out something than
nothing; that we can always do a 2nd or revised version; that we mist face facts
and not put out a book which a high percentage of retailers simply won't, ha dej
He also, at the start, said something along the lines of what I regard as
Shubian erroneous doctrine: that we should show the responsibility that the
USA and Germany (Hitler?) had for the state of affairs in the USSR; I said all such
things might be sub-themes, if they could be tucked in without detracting from
the main themes, but that I thought they were very dubious: 172 pages isn't enuf.
to show what a bad man and regime it is.
My views, agreeing with mich he had said, included: that we ought to put out
something that the man in the barber-shop, anywhere in the world, would leaf
through and couldn't turn over more than 3 or 4 Ronsecutive pages without beginning
to think: "This really must be bad man, killing that many of his own cabinet."
That we should not attempt either an exhaustive or even consecutive chronological
treatment of the 71 years since 1879 or even since 1905 or 1917. Just hammer home
main points, such as that they had a Constituent Assembly, until Lenin killed it
by force and fraud, etc.

Fericht Hr.14./Portsetzt
Ausstellur "Sowjetarmee", Blatt 2.
angelegten, für die Sowjetarmee siegreichen Schlachten.
Man kann sich deutlich vorstellen, wie die Schlachten vor Mos-
kau Dez. 1941, bei Stalingrad Sept.-Dez. 1942, bei Kursk und
Charkow im Sommer 1943 und schließlich im Raum um Berlin sich
abwickelten. Unter einem Bilde von einer sowjetischen Waffen-
Fabrik steht: * "Die sowjetische Armee errang ihre Erfolge mit
Jaffen, die von sowjetischen Konstrukteuren gebaut sind.”
In einer Inschrift zu 10 großen strategischen Bewegungen der
Armeen im Jahre 1944 heißt es: "In der so entstandenen Situation
war es klar, daß die Sowjetunion auch ohne Hilfe der Verbündeten
im Stande ist, ganz Deutschland zu besetzen und auch Frankreich
zu befreien".
..
Auf diese eigentlichen Kriegsbilder folgt eine Serie unter
dem Leitspruch "Befreiung der Völker". Man sieht, wie einrücken-
de sowjetische Truppen in Prag, Budapest, Bukarest und auch in
Fernen Osten von der einheimischen Bevölkerung jubelnd begrüßt
warden, und gewinnt aus Bildern von der Farade im Jahre 1947
vor dem Kreml einen gewissen Eindruck von der heutigen Stärke
und Sinsatsbereitschaft der Armee. Bilder von besonders -ver-
dienten Militärs finden sich in allen Abteilungen.
Militärs, finden der mee. Bild
In Moskau und in anderen sowjetischen Städten gibt es auch
besondere Armee- Theater, deren Aufführungen Themen von
Siegen, Feldherren und Heldentaten der sowjetischen Armee ver-
herrlichen.
In diesem Rahmen mögen noch swel Filme erwähnt sein, die
kürzlich im Haus der Kultur der S.U. gezeigt wurden.
Der eine behandelt den 2. Teil der Stalingrad-Schlacht. Kein
eigentlicher Kriegs-Dokumentarfilm, d.h. keine im Kriege an der
Front gemachten Aufnahmen, sondern später mit Schauspieler und
Statisten-Truppen gestellte filmische Handlung. Die Persönlich–
keit des Generalissimua. Stalin steht im Vordergrund der Idee.
Der deutsche Beschauer erfährt, in wie sinnloser Weise der wahn=
sinnige Hitler Hunderttausende deutscher Soldaten in aussichts-
loser Lage dahin opferte. Das Publikum nahm den Film mit Ernst
und Ärgriffenheit auf.
Ein anderer Film "Die von Kronstadt" heroisiert den erfolg=
reichen Widerstand Hoter Marinetruppen im Jahre 1919 vor Lenin-
grad im Kampf gegen weißrussische Judenisch-Truppen. Je heftiger
gekämpft und geschossen wird, desto lebhafter reagieren die
zahlreichen Jugendlichen unter den Zuschauern. Der Film läuft in
russischer Sprache mit deutschen Unterzeilen.

Both Carpenter and Richards agree that Mrs. Burnham may travel

Cawing money from travel fund for that purpose, without considoration
Suman's otetus vis-a-vis CIA. This on the theory that
the travel is desirable because of services she may rondor to the

England, Austria or Russia was most responsible for WW I. It is folly to maste
space attacking Stalin because he fought the Finns in order to get better defenses
for Leningrad, as we might fight anyone who threatened the Panama Canal. Or even
to try too hard to pin WW II on him. (It is still at least arguable that it wd

uncertain; for example, SIDNEY HOOK and DAVID LILIENTPAL.

exploitation as we noted yesterday. However, it does not som to
require SHUB's presence in Germany.

as they exceed his annual salary. I asked "What portion?" and Lyle said
"oh, perhaps or 1/3," which, if the excess were $12,000 a figure le
suggested as possible- would bring him in an extra $4 or $6,000.
Shub's contract with CIA expires 31 Dec. 1951. His contract with 3 men,
Lyle pointed out, would still be in effect after that. / But his contract with
Xot CIA would still
Swen, even after 37 70 doubt obligate him to return royalties to CIA, 1.e.
Dec. 1951._/
I said this mightn't be a bad idea, as Shib may tend to go somewhat
sour, seeing his collaborator getting his much larger salary and 7 royalties
on top of that. On second thoughts, however, it is doubtless a very poor
precedent and we could perhaps obtain and quote to Shub CIA Legal's opinion
to that effect that OPC employees should take royalties from commercial
enterprises with which they happen to be connected.
I believe he is paid quite a generous figure, which ought to keep
a married man with no dependents ahead of the Collector of Internal Revenue
If not, or if it is thought he is really worth more, the possibility of
suggesting to him a salary raise, when his contract as Agent comes up for
renewal, could be considered. At any rate, in the interests of keeping his
morale up during the final phases of work on the book, I suggest the whole
matter should be handled not too brusquely.
RE "COMMUNIST 200", and refusal of many US retailers to handle it, see.
attached Memo of Record of what Munson told mo.
Munsoni "We have to face plain facts. My experience with "CZ" shows
that we have to mix in glasses of orange juice with the castor oil. "CZ"is
about as vicious as the traffic will bear. If the "Stalin" photo-book smacks
too strongly of propaganda, a lot of retailers just won't even handle it.
jj
CONCLUSION. We should stay in NY long enuf to
(a) Hear everything Shub can say in defense of his version;
(b) Do a strong debil's advocate job against the pages we think
he should delete
(c) Insist that, in the remaining 66 pages, certain topics must be
adequately dealt with: Slave Labor, Defections, Cultural Purges,
Purges of top Communists in Iron Curtain countries.
(d) Hope for the best and be prepared to accept what may be a not too
satisfactory bargain, especially in view of what Lyle saya about
retailers, and about mintaining Owen's reputation.

Report on Distribution of Der Honat through an Exemplary Cutlet
1. This describes the distribution activities of a single
outlet, with connections primarily but not exclusively to students
in the Sorist Zone. Since December 1949 the cutlet has been.
supplied 1115 le copies and several hundred separate articles.
At first single issues were, supplied in numbers of 100, but
because of rapidly increasing demand was later increased to 150
copies. However, the popularity of Der Monat has spontaneously
led to a broader range of possibilities and a total of at least
320 copies for issue has been requested. To provide a total of
so many copies from num) 8/7 to 16 inclusive will mean a further
delivery of 1575 copies. A few copies of mumbers 5, 6 & 7 have
been delivered as well as staple single copies of George Orwell's
"Animal Farm" and other articles taken by breaking up these
same issues. Distribution has been free of charge and this has

the travel expenses of contacts to and from Berlin.
Reactions to Der Monat delivery through this outlet has
been overwhelmingly encouraging. Each copy is said to change
hands "at least eight or nine times and as many as twenty time s
is considered usual. The result is that Der Monat has become
widely known among students in the Eastern Zone. It is reported
that it is even read openly in the mess-halls; SED students
procure it and read it, although when on their own they are
said to be more secretive than the non-communist organized
student. Certain articles have become sicely know, particularly
Ornell's 1/4". An explanation of where the magazines come
they are bought for SOUZON
from is given in the following terņs:
students by the Free University. It is generally accepted in
the Soviet 2Zone that the Free University is the source of "anti-
communist student agitations" etc. Persons connected with the
Free University who come in contact with East Zone students state
that they are being continuously asked for coples of Der Monat,
in the sense of "I've been getting it seventh hand; I'd like to
get it first hand.".

e) Until recently a FDJ school for higher functionaries
in Necklenburg near the zonal border was supplied with copies
of Der Monat which were read of Nicially as the basis for
working out counter-arguments. The connection was broken by
the arrest of the courier, who was carrying Telegraf leallets.
(f) Twenty copies are regularly supplied for distribution.
to and through a Volkspolized unit in Thuringia.
6. The outlet expresses great satisfaction with Monat
distribution, considers it the ideal kind of reading for euiping
oppositional students in the Soviet Zone with relatively safer
and strategically suitable weapons, .. eas" and the "spirit
of Europe. Der Jonat is often contrasted with the Tele Taf
in this sense: Der Monat is not còn blered to exaggerate, is
not the other pole, "with the truth somewhere between", but is
respected and trusted for itself.

Attention was continuously drown to the popularity of
->
Orwell's "1984". Hence the outlet asks whether it would be possible
to make-up from broken muzers single stapted copies of "
recalling that this had been done for them in the case of Animal
Farm and other articles.
4. The outlet operates through an apparatus of couriers
Universities are supplied.
to all universities of the Soviet fone.
by as many as four and an average of three different couriers,
unknown to one another. Leipzig, Halle, Cera, Greifswald, mesden
and Rustock are thus covered. There are a large number of delivery
contacts at the Humboldt University. Also there are contacts
to the "Landes Hochschule" in Potsam which is designed especially
for training SSD functionaries, teachers, and key occupations.
Couriers from other academic institutions and circles are also
supplied, as well as to a number of non-academic circles of sig-
nificant strategic value, as described below.
5. The following examples are citeș:
*) At a recent four-sonal meeting of evangelical student-
ministers from all zones fifteen copies were distributed to several
SZ delegates. More could not be furnished because of lack of
supplies at that time. The recepients-subsequently, expressed
such interest that regular delivery with a large number of copies
has been established. The Karl Jaspers article was considered
popular in this circle, and strong curiosity was expressed regarding
"19S!," which was being discussed in the sone.
b) A professor of journalism at one Soviet-Zone university.
appreached a contact for two copies, imponising to make good use
of them. He asked that they be supplied regularly and sent a
Soth
student from Leipzig to confirm this and pick them up.
students and professor were checked upon and the delivery made.
c) A group of liberal and social-democratic students organized
in the SED cooperate in a closed working-committee is recognized
by the university as an academic activity of the faculty to which
these students and professor belong. Honat articles are reai
and discussed and then translated into non-derman languages and
passed on as reading matter to trusted students in other sections
of the Philosophical faculty.
-
The CDC executive in a city in Saxony receives the
magazine, using it as a scussion material regularly at closed
educational forums for training party functionaries. Three weeks
age the article Tifo contra Stalin was discussed.

PHONED SHUB
Lou Scherer (NE) phoned to say that he had to see Levitas, editor
of Now, in connection with a new project, and with several other matters.
Would like to see him for about an hour. CSP had suggested I ask Boris
Shub to arrange the appointment,
I phoned Boris Shub, and phoned Scherer back that Shub would meet him
at 10.50 a.m. tomorrow in the bookstore below (2) the NL office at 7 E. 15 St.
Shub will introduce Scherer to Levitas at 11.
Re PHOTO BOCK
Boris said thore are 3 matters which "we can live without, but it
would distinctly strengthen the book if you could perhaps get them at the
Library of Congress.
(1) It is conceivable that there exist photos of crowds being fired
upon in Nov.-Jan, 1918-1918, in connection with rioting on the dissolution
of the Constituent Assembly. (See Shab's Lenin).
(2) Fighting in Moscon, Nov. 1917 (There was no fighting in Petersburg)
(3) Collectivization. Some think it is conceivable there exist
.
photos of peasants being shipped north to Siberia during Collectivization.
Cf. CIA Graphics?
Cf. Library of Congress.

Re RUSSIANS AS ALLIES
Boris has just heard from a Russian friend, and has sent to London for
confirmation – seen nothing in the papers about it here- that there has been
formed in London & BRITISH SOCIETY FOR A FREE RUSSIA, with Major Hilton (mthor
and ex-military attache in Moscow) as president and the Duchess of Atholl as
vice-president. Encouraging, he thought.
He also mentioned the FREEDOM UNION FOR GERMAN RUSSIAN FRIENDSHIP reported
in the May 11 NY Herald-Trib, with Mayor Reuter and some Russians among the
members.

_ career of Stalin. Lyle showed us 114, finished layouts / 1.e. 57 two-page
spreads / of an eventual 172 or 174 and told us that the remainder would be
finished in about 3 weeks. He also said that 60 pages of the text were non
finished, and the rest would be done in about 6 weeks. He has asked us to provide

domestic arrangements in support of the Congress, for which Professor Hock
has been designated American representativo. There were no other persons
present.
Professor Hook opened the conversation by emphasizing the need to
minind so the Government's interest in the Congress. He felt that it was
essential to retain the appearance of a completely private venture. I
assured him this was also the Department's view. Referring to the status
of Melvin J. Lasky, secretary of the Congress in Berlin, as an employee.
of HICOG, Professor Hook then said he thought . Lasky should be given
a leave of absence in order to carry through the project in a private.
expacity. I promised to look into this problem, and commented that it
could not be done readily without Mr. Lasky's cooperation. I also
suggested that sinco Hr. Lasky to my knowledge was spending some of his
personal funds on preparations for the Congress, it would only be fair
to look for come other source of income for Hr. Lasky during such time as
he might be an leave from Government service.

On contiming the discusalem, it was clear that in working alone
Professor Hook had as yet been able to make any considerable progress
on behalf of the Congress, and that there was urgent need for (a) a
minimum staff to handle the program in this country and (b) a small
Callocation of funds to pay for telephone, stationery, publicity, etc.
Until the present time, Profess Rock has been carrying the entire
expense and work hisself, and apparently has had to be extremely careful
about such items as long distance telephone calls. For example, he felt
he could afford to telephone Professor. John Dewey in Florida and ask his
to sponsor the Congress (which invitation Professor Dewey accepted,) but
The hesitated to put out the larger funds to telephone Upton Sinclair in
California. He would also like to call the Congress headquarters in
Berlin, but felt that the transatlantic toll charge was quite beyond
his means.
In reply to by quary as to what sort of budget would be necessary,
Professor Book suggested that would need a secretary-typist for two
months and a public relations man on a part-time basis for the same period.
He thought the secretary could be obtained for $250
obtained for $250 a month and the pub-
licity man for less than $500, La addition, $500 would be sufficient fær
such items as rental of typewriters, stationery, telephone calls, postage,
etc. This would take a total budget of $2,000. The rental expense could
be reduced, he thought, by using the offices of The New Leader, a Socialist
publication of which he is one of the editors. He did not think it advis-
able to have a pretentious office, since obvious affluence would incite
suspicion. The sctivity could be organised by Americans for Intellectual
Freedon, of which he is the founder. This group staged the anti-Commmist
program in Hew York in March 1949 for less than $25.00.
As to the expenses of Americas representatives going to Berlin,
Professor Fook hoped that it would not be necessary to use military trans-
portation, since that would create the impression of Government sponsor-
ship. He thought commercial transportation would definitely be preferable,
and added that he would like to be in a position to give cash grants to
the delegates of about $700, that is, the round-trip fare plus a few dollars
over for incidentals. He felt it would be undesirable for too largs an
American representation to be sent. Probably six or seven people sculd
bo anough. This would mean a transportation budget of less than $5000.
Several times during the conversation, Professor Lacky stressed that
it was not necessary to have a large sum of money. For what was needed,
he said, the right people could hardly be paid; it was essential, he said,
to have dedicated personnel" who were willing if necessary to make per-
somal sacrifices.
On the other hand, he thought it vital to have the right sort of
publicity. The press arrangements should to carefully made. He hoped
that someone in Washington could ask Mr. Honry Luce of Time and Life
and Er. A. E. Sulsberger of the Eew York Mass to arrange the right sort
of coverage, that is, the right people, such as Anne O'Hare cordel

to his dilemma.
To handle the publicity Professor Hook thought he might hiro

Certain American Diplomatic Officers
The Formation of National Committeo for Free Europe, Inc., with
headquarters in New York, was announced on June 1, 1940. This
Committee is a private organization concerning itself with democratic
loaders and scholars who are exiled from the following countries:
Foland, Czechoslovalia, Hungary Rumania, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria.
The Committed will be financed by private contributions. .
The following is quoted from a statement issued by Joseph C.
fre, Chairman of the Committee in announcing its formation:
'
"Our program begins with the tangible fact of the presence
here of thes: exiles and refugees. Thoro is an American trad-
ition of hospitality to political refugees. The promise which
we gave at Yalta remains unrodeaned. Hore than that we have a
definite self-interest in helping to keep alive, and in full
rigor political leaders who share our view of Life--loader's
who have refused to buckle under, men who have not hesitated
to risk their lives for their democratic faith. Aciton No. 1
in our irmediate program we propose-iavo in fact already begun--
to find suitable occupations for these democratic eiles... no
are setting out to find suitable positions for them in colleges
and universities. We are proposing to ask others of them to
prepare studies on topics for hich they are especially equipped.
At the same time we are encouraging each national group of
miles to draw together politically--all democratic elements,
that is, these other than Fascists or Communists--in order to
form in their temporary American haven National Committoes which
can stand as symbols of democratic hope for their countrymen
in Eastern Eirope.... We look forward to the day when there will
no longer be an Iron Curtain....and these six nations which we
helped liberate from the Nazi oppression will be free from the
Cotanist oppression and once more, can organize their existence
in their own way. Then that time comes there will be something
close to social chaos and political vacuum, for the first effort
of totalitarian règimes is to destroy all constructive elements
which night build anything different from themselves. Locking
formard to that historic and critical time we have in mind that,
if mearahilo democratic leaders have been helped to keep alive
and in vigor in the danceratic havons to which they have been
driven we can hope that, returning, they will have parts in a
democratic reconstruction. Our second purpose will be to put
the voices of these ailed political leaders on the air, addressed
to their own peoples back in Europe, in their om languages, in

and reinforce overt activities planned by occupation authorities
to achieve the same objective. All OFC operations directed against

Those attributable to indigenous individuals and

In viss of the strongly pro-western and anti-Soviet orientation
of the Berlin population generally, the second type of activity
offers exceptional opportunities to inspire, guide and covertly
assist actual German resistance to the rally.

1. Background
: a.
The communist youth mass meeting planned for Berlin during the
Whitsun holidays, 27, 25, and 29 Hay, has been and is the subject of a
major propaganda offensive by the Russians and by German communists.
It has followed the characteristic Soviet pattern of creating confusion
and tenseness on the part of the propaganda targets achieving this ob-
jective by alternating belligerent threats with peaceful platitudes.
The throats have ranged from declarations that the communist youth would
drive the Western imperialists out of Eerlin to outright statements that
they would seize the Western Berlin government and restore the city to
a unified, peaceful capital of Germany. The peaceful declarations have
stated that the demonstration of 500,000 boys and girls (from all over
Germany, and from other countries) will chiefly take place in Eastera
Berlin and will consist of rully-marching, sports events, fireworks, and
huge peace meetings. Permission was requested by the FDJ, of Oberburger-
meister Reuter, to march in a body to the Olympic Stadium (in the British
Sector) but Reuter briefly and emphatically refused.
b. Three groups are officially dealing with the situation.
(1) The Ferlin Allied Komandatura
✓..
×
(2) A committee under Oturgermeister Reuter
x
(3) A special HICOG committea.
K
acted
These groups have coordinated their plans and accordingly reasonable pre-
cautions should be taken to protect vital Installations in Rest Eerlin.
The police force has been augmented and provided with riot equipment.
C. It is now estimated that it is not the intention of the communists
to make a serious effort to drive the Western occupying forces out of
Eerlin, or to seize the mest city government. However, their campaign has
succeeded to this extent, that it is not known whether or not they will
attempt an actual putsen, or if they will adopt a policy of opportunism
and probe-and-thrust at West Ferlin defences with the determination to
advence as far as they can; or if they will, in fact, confine themselves.
* to meetings and demonstrations in East. Eerlin. The possibility exists
that their demonstrations may get out of hand or go beyond the intention
of the impressarios of the show. Whether or not they attempt a coup d'etat,
they assuredly will press every propaganda advantage.

d. The situation has been regarded as serious and potentially
dangerous. Even as a propaganda triumph it right serve to strengthen
communist drives all over Surope, especially in Germany, and if thats
was any manifest weakness or temporizing on the part of forces in est
Ferlin, the Deutschlandtreffen might sorve as a springboard to huge quins..
2. Purpose of CPC olan
OFC operations against the Deutschlandtreffen are intended to oppose,
harrass and attempt to turn to U.S. advantage the communist FDJ rally;
also to render cooperation with other elements of resistance.. To achieve
this purpose, it is contemplated that a number of propaganda and
psychological warfare activities will be utilized; it may also be
necessary to provide specific support for resistance groups prepared to
use physical violence to prevent FDJ demonstrations in Rest Ferlin.
3. Plans
Since January, the German Hission, OPC, has been planning a counter-
attack. On 31 January, a field dispatch outlined steps to be taken
and this has been amplified considerably in the last two months. At the
present time, plans to neutralize or defeat the psychological and physical
attack of the communists, contemplate the following:
&.
•
Clandestine propaganda, distributed throughout East Germany,
in advance of the Deutschlandtreffen, intended to break down desire
to participate and exposing the militaristic and totalitarian
character of the affair. Included:
a pastoral letter, addressed to all clergymen in the East
Zone, entreating that young people be kept out of Ferlin during
the FDJ rally, to prevent damage to their souls and bodies;
spreading of rumors that large masses of young Germans are
to be rounded up and shipped elsewhere for forced labor, and that
numbers of them will be killed (with the murders charged to the
Americans) in order to create martyrs for the cause;
special editions of Berlin papers (distributed in East Ger-
many) emphasizing the spectacle of Soviet Russia driving German
youth into militarism.
b. Organized radio, press and other forms of publicity, during
the Deutschlandtreffen, distributed throughout East Ferlin and East
Germany, featuring positive achievements of the Test as contrasted
to negative achievements of the East.
C. The staging of counter attractions, intended to reveal to
large numbers of communist youth the better, unregimented life of

representing high achievement and international reputation in fields
of labor, philosophy, politics, literature, art, music, education,
and science. The Congress, held on the borderline between free and
slave Europe, will concern itself with denouncing and exposing the
swindle of communist peace propaganda, will beam its message to the
satellite states to the effect that only intellectual and cultural
slavery is possible in the Soviet system. Arrangements will be
effected for broadcasting and publicizing the meetings of the Congress
and a large distribution of its deliberations throughout East Germany

to Burnham the outfit represents 1200 journalists scattered over
Western Europe, the USA, Australia and South America. They
are said to be publishing 170 papers of varying degrees of
-importance. Burnham says that the services of the organization
are being offered - presumably for propaganda use and that
their first objective is to establish a New York office, for
operation and liaison, and that they need $42,000. Burnham
thinks someone here should explore the potential usefulness of

TIMING. Burnham is disturbed at the prospect of going to Europe
For as long as sixty days and is quite reluctant to consider a
longer period.. This brought up the entire matter of the
Congress and its juxtaposition to the FDJ Deutschland Treffen.
All of us evidenced some despair over the fact that obviously
we cannot mastermind either project without further advices from
the field which seem to have been suspended.
[
The question was raised as to whether or not the Congress
actually could be held in June, considering the lateness of the
present dato. Burnham brought up for consideration the possibility
of his going to Berlin about the first of May, or the last week
in April, staying over the end of May, then returning to the United
States - on the theory that the Congress might not be held until
August or September. He proposed the 23rd of August (date of the
Nazi-Russian pact) as an appropriate date. He then would start
out again, presumably in the middle of August; in the meantime,
he would establish contact with people in England, France and the
US who might need pressure brought to bear upon them to attend
the Congress.
If the Congress is to be held about the 20th of June,
he suggests that he might go to Berlin about the middle of April,
accomplish all he can in the way of advice as to the Deutschland
Treffon, leave Borlin very early in Hay, travel through France and Engla
land back to the US, building up acceptances for the Congress,
returning to Berlin on the 25th of May and staying over for the
Congress.

historical answer to the Reichstag fire.
4. As long as the Roloistag stands in its present ruined condition
it is a cancer foeding on the offended national pride of most Germans.
This is particularly true because it is within sight of the strident Soviot
war memorial. Even the best German democrat cannot pass this building
without being mad at most of the world. In the normal course of events,
the building would probably be restored for some narrow, German purpose.
By making it the Houseof European Freedom wo kill Birds with one

a) Wo give normal, healthy German and Berlin pride (as distinguished
from its morbid, resentful and chauvinistic manifestations), a positive
outlet. This is reeducation through dramatic action instead of Sunday school.
moralising which registors with nobody. All Berlin will be tremendously
--and healthfully---proud of itself on this day.
(b) We strike a blow for freedom everywhere.
o) we deal an effective blow to resurgent German nationalism
in Western Germany and in the Soviet zone, by making both its forms seen
low, provinsbal, stupid, and bush league compared to the Reichstag rising
like phoonix out of the ashes in the cause of European freedom.
d) to give West Derlin an ensemous moralo boost and forcefully
remind them that (1) Berlin is a great motropolis (Weltstadt) and (11)
that it rains part of the free world--in fact one of the great bastions
of that free world.
3) The Stage Sots
to
No attempt should be made to prottify the Reichstag for the
ceremony. Reconstruction will proceed later, with pernios collected from
people all over the world. (A topa limit should be placed on contributions
to prevent mon of wealth and power from contributing more than simple
plain folks everywhere).

At the unveiling, there should be temporary plaques or
plaster-cast kink bas-reliefs of the Great Man of Freedom who will

of frendon running through it all the time. Contributions
coming from prk DPs individually, and from special fund-
raising events in DP ceps, would have an obvious dramatic value.
5. As the structure begins to become usable, it should fentury
all the type activities that make Furope and Euros uvilization
worth saving. The emphasis should be on things of lasting value
rather than refrigerators, Coon Cola and such. I other words,

The Lest Prepost best)
best is meant that which Europeans would respect for its artisito
or spiritual content, not tasso mion aka the most monuy--they can
be seen elsewhere in Berlin.
Exhibitions of painting, lectures in current trends in
literature, lectures in political salance, Mistory and contemporary
politios, by outstanding artists, scholars, etc., should be moCK
part of the feature of the use of European Freedom, insofar as
possible. Exeres The Hilding should use a library, and even
if it imnt very large, it should include the Great Books in the
leading languages, as well as current periodicals, etc to keep the
intellectuals of Berlin--and any other callers--on their toes. There
is no such library in Berlin today..
Symposia, Tom-Hall-Meeting of the fir, to events sk
could also be held here from time to time. The important thing is
to keep the building, it's reconstruction, and the events it
presents, as close to the spirit of the opening ceremonies as
possible.
4. All of the above is far simpler than it sounds, Europeans
love to be given such projects. And I rather suspect, that Americans
would take to it too, if the broadcast account of the Congross
proceedings ix properly presents the issue to them.

in the two loading alphabet of Burope (the Latin and Quillio)-
is enough for the opening ceremony. Two names for and/or busts for
each country will suffice. A great quote from each Could go with it.
Bxamples:
1. Frances Voltaire (I disagino with everything you say but will
defend to the death your right to say it- words to that effect)
Danton
2. Gormary, Goethe
Haine (There is a Maine quotation which Mayor Reuter
(as the host of the Congress) could well use in his opening remarks.It
would set the right tone for all that follows. xxxsaxaxatuteslux
Borax afatex lieine says soumhere that when the black-red-gold flag
of 1348 becomes the flag of European freedom, he will gladly subscribe
to it. I need not bolabor the point. Xext If the Germans
om bo mold on this approach, it is the most devastating answer to
nationalism, to the resurgent neo-fascist roups who are now h dxxxx
flying the lack-white-rod of Imperial Germany.
Heino's words
offer to the Germans their only chance of return to greatness which
the non-Geram world can ever respect. (Note then the black-red-gold
is the present flag of West German public-without, however, the
Freedon-loving European content that Heine wanted to give it.
3. Italy--- Garibaldi
Massini (9)
4. If we want to include the U.S. despite the fact that this
is house of European freedom, there are two great names that will soll
without causing any negative reaction anywhere.
(a) Jefferson (The most effective angwar to the Coumnist
charge that we are reactionaries are his words on the revolutionary
right to overthrow a bed regime. I see no reason why the distators of the
Ermalin and the NKVD should steal the revolution from the mon of Loxing
ton and Concord, Valley Forge and th Declaration of Independence. The
fnot that a few lost souls in this country are afraid of Joffor song's
great words, is also no reason not to use them.
b) Lincoln.

5. Russia: T
The Decembrists. These are the man who returned to
Russia from the Napoleonic wars inued with western ideas and attempted
to challenge the Tearist autocracy with a revolutionary democratic
program. They were ha god in 1925. A famous plaque showing the profilos
of the rive leaders has been reproduced very widely in the Soviet Union
and is known to practically evory Russian school child. In fact, the
Russians know everything about these mon, except the ideas and ideals
they represented. These have beor, parafully suppressed or rondored false
through Soviet Newspeak. For the Reichstag unvolling, I'd have this
plaque reproduced-large enough to be soon across the street in the
Soviet sector. It should face the Soviet side of the street and have the
word "FECEMBRISTS" in the Russian languato as well as English, Gorman,
French.

revolutionary music which neither Comaniam nor Hasan have pollutad
(e.. the Harsaillaise, Sorbian chetalk songs, Frider sur Sonne rur
Freiheit," whose Russian version was sung by ronerations of revolutionists
and legal words of which are still roxxx disseminated today
amour Soviet troops--i've seen an actual leaflet). These songs need
not be in the least provocative or an inciterent to mything-except to
a deep feeling that freedom is one and individ:ble. These conja can
be recorded in RIAS OF AX Free Europe studio3 wall in advance of
meeting, and can be piped over loudspeakers at Reichstag meeting, with
the crowds joining in.. This technique was successfully used with the
baxtax last of the abovementioned songs at the Reich tag rally of
September 3, 1948. It is very simple and effective. Radio listenerus
get the impression that several hundred thousand people are singing, if
the acoustics are handled right. No songs should be used to which exce tion
can be taken on the ground that it is aimed against any particular existing
regime. There is no reason to do so. Txepexxxxx The good
old stuff applies by implication- and it is an implication which the adversary
Ensabii cannot adrit. Can only shut its ears. Pomerightonowenienckerbs
The rightxxxxx use of music at the Reichstag is essential to
the success of the whole. It is a vital part of the over-all production. Its
importance for broadcasting purposes can scarcely be overestimated. Gives
the whole show the lift and the universal 11lt that is noëdød.
V) THE POLITICAL LINE
1. Freedom is one and indivisible. It concerns all men everythere.
EVERYBODY DESERVES IT. THERE ARE NO CHOSEN PEOPLES, NATIONS OR CONTINENTS.
THERE IS ONLY HAM.
2. This is HOT Europe defying Russia. On the contrary, it is Eŭropo
reaching out north, south, east and west to all its children, including
the Russians, and summoning them in the great crusade which must go on
until all are free. If the Soviet rulers want to turn their backs
on Europe, that's their business. The xxxxx Freedon Congress and yor
cutor of Berlin will assume that the Russians want very much to be a part
and parcel of Free Europe. This is the only approach: which divides the
Politburo not only from the common people, but from a decisive sement
of the upper party, intellectual and army command of Russia. I
sure
3. Raxopaxevrak Free Burope Versus Slave Russia is the/road to
World War III. Let's play away from this at all times
4. Free Burope, including the Russians, versus the Politburo
and the Cominform, is the only way to make the Burnham thesis work---or
at least give it a fighting chance. Thisxander It is at lagt worth
a good test run from the Reichstag steps in connection with this
project. Involves no risk, except the use of a little imagination, and
its cost is very alight indeed.

She was known in the Taarist fortress prison where she spent most of
her life, as the "hona of the Schluessolbirg.

When President Garfield was eschasinated, Vera Finer and her
prison coaredes addressed an open letter of sympathy to the American
people in which they condemned this not of terrorism. They said that
the use of terror against the elected reprosentative of the poople was
Just as immoral and wrong, as absolution's use of terror against the
Russian people. They explained that they were forsod--against their
will--to combat despotion with forge, but intended to disobotinue its
use as soon as a representative domcratic covernment existed in Russia.
Vera Fignor lived to be liberated by the democratio revolution of .
March 1917. The delivered a great speech in a. Petrograd theatre on the.
meaning of freedom, shortly after the fall of the Tsar. B cause of her

ideals that the Soviet distature seok to eradicate from the Russia
conscience and consciousness. Yet her name as such--robbed of its moral
content--is known to most Soviet Russians. S viet textbooks never speak
badly of hor--nor do they tell her great story. Here is an opportunity
to restore hor name to the Rssians --alon-side of the Dobrists. Would
he difficult indeed to find a better symbol to stand together with such
names as Danton, Jefferson, Garibaldi, Heino.
This is not dramatic corn; it is psychological warfare with atonio
power. By restoring Vera Figner to the Russians, from the stops of the
House of Feng European Freedon in Berlin, wo start the chain reaction,
Whether this becomes an atomic explosion of test-tube or

in the Russian people. But clearly here' a way of reaching them wit
(and the "them" includes high officers of the Soviet army and officials

a POSTLIVE APPROACH to which they are acutely misceptible after over 30
years of spiritual and moral starvation.

C) ACCOMPANYING MUSIC, THEATRE, BEC
L
1. Music for the Congress should be of two general enterorien (a)
a special concert by the Berlin Philharmonio, if possible with an out-
standing Externally conductor. She ideal would be Arturo Toscanini (he
practionlly spit in Mussolini's ove). If Toscanini is not available,
the port best would be Serge Koussevitsky or Ivor Stravinsky. The
reason is obvious. I think that of the German conductors, only Brino
Walter would be right for our broader moral purposes. To use Furtwanglar
would be a mistake. I did, wo'd no longer be on the side of the
angeth. I think the Deathoven "inth with its closing hann on the brother-
hood of man (8) Schiller's Ode to Joy) is just right. Could be proceeded
by the Prometheus or Ement Overtres, both of which are perfect in political
content--and are exciting must to Kuropean ears as well. This concert
could be given in a hall, broadcast and then poptions of the tape recording
could be used again at the Reichstag. The concert should precede the Roich
stag ceremony.

ADDENDUM, AFTER THE CONGRESS IS OVER
On pp. 1-6 supra, I in
I indicated the emeral lines that would make
the Reichstag dedication as a House of European Prosdom effective. This
ceremony, to gether with the other events of the Exxx Ferlin cultural
Congress of Amo 1950, will be destas indicated supra--over a world-
wido notwork. That to the fentic ectaube where everything worth saying
on the subject of freedom and the dignity of an will be compressed into
& few days. (nother wanting Congress veel could be a special
performance of Buechner's play Persons Tod at the Hebbel Theatre. If possible
get Madimir Sokoloffret Hollymed for the Robespierre role. He did it
for Max Reinhardt. I trust bo's still alivo). Assuming that the show is
a success, that only discharges half the mission. The other half is to
build up the Reichstag structure, stone by stone, in line with the political
and moral ideale indicated above. The Reichstag as House of European Freedomi
THE HOUSE OF EUROPEAK FRIEDON (or Free Europe).
"
gradually
1. The general spirit has already been indicated above. The great
nanes and words should be presented in simple dramntio terms, designed by
an artist with the talent and moral fibre to understand what this is all
about. The aesthetic problem is a rather tricky one. The Reichstag is hardly
the most beautiful stricture in the world, yet it would be a mistake to
depart from its basic style in the course of recnstruation. To reconoilo
these two problems--the greatness of simplicity, with the stuffiness of
the existing structure, is a problem for some contemporary M. chelangelo.

The exterior should not contain more than a dozen or so nazes
of the calibre indicated on pp 2-4 supras Jefferson, Danton, Voltaire,

without which the rest is largely asted efforts the Russians. If we leave

world, with the emphasis on pennies not dollers. The longer it takes to
explete the job-within its of xurre--the better for political
purposes. Enough if one segment is finished fairly soon, with an
auditorium and/or exhibition hall. The prolonged fund-raising drive
will supply Rdio Free Europe, the Voice of America, BBC and lots of
other agencies with a steady flow of good, positive popy with the theme

That will make this show doubly affective. Therefore, the working

2. Adequate/guarda should be posted at all x broadcasting and
transmitter facilities in Berlin. I am thinking particularly of the trans-
mitter in the Brits section of Berlin, whionis far too close to the Soviet
line for cafort. Phile I am convinced that the Russians would make no
attempt to start a disturbance at the Reichstag (If we hake normal
security precautions). I think they may well attempt to sabotage some of
the radio installations. I would not trust any except proper American and/
or British public safety officers and guards to protect these.
Alternate transmitting and broadcasting units should be held.

6. One American, thoroughly familiar with the aims, large and mall,
of this project, should maintain close personal liaison with or Ernst
Reuter of Berlin. That in agromment with the general aims and objectives
formulated above--and that he is precisely the man to present these aims
in terms which all Berliners, decent Germans, and the rest of the world
will 'understand and adaire, I know is the case. He is the perfect host
and master of ceremonies. He speaks German, English, French, Russian, Turkish

April 1951
Munson went through the complete book last Wednesday and Thursday evenings,
April 11 and 12. He is sure it will be one of the really important books
of 1951."
He has asked for 3 photostat proofs of the layout, which we can look at
down here He agrees with me that no useful purpose would be served by my
going to NY to see it, as B Shub had sugested. He thinks it inadvisable that
a stream of people should go to Shub's collaborator's apartment,
They are now aiming at a book of 175 to 195 pages, the pages to be of
Vogue size; which, on an average of 7 to 8 photos per double-page, will come to
some 600 or more photos,
It is more than the personal career of Stalin; it could better be called
something like "The Rise and Rule of Staliniam
Ha
He is pressing for a SEPTEMBER 10th PRESS DATE. That may be too optimistio,
but he has located a Chicago press which prints either Vogue (Conde Nast) or
a Vogue-size magazine, and which, if they stick to that format, can handle it
with dispatch, Munson will be going to Chicago to investigate.
PRICE…….I could be 100% wrong on this estimate," but
on this estimate," but: it should cost a
minimum of $1.25 to print, and, if we want to make 25¢ not $2.95 or $3.00 would
be the minimum at which Brentano could retail it. I'll bet it will come to
more than this. ASS
Shub's collaborator, "absolutely wonderful; the book is now 75% nis", will
get 7% royalties. Shub's nominal royalties will revert to Swen,
Munson feels strongly that it is very bad policy to sell a book at
less than obvious cost. He says he is completely certain that this is true
in the Orient, and gave ds XOODOO a chapter-and-ver se
example (which escapes me) to illustrate it.
By
guousingvious cost he means that it may be OK to count on t

DATE: 20 February 1950
Reference is made to your memorandum dated 15 February 1950 concern-
ing the subject.
This memorandum requested change in status for the subject from an
operational clearance to that of a covert consultant for the purposes as
outlined in the memorandum of 16 February 1950.
In accordance with the provisions set forth in the Director's menor-
andum of 14 February 1949, entitled "Security and Operational Clearances",
a covert security clearance as requested in the memorandum of 15 February
1950 is granted for the use of the subject.
'
This covert clearance as granted does not always constitute complete
compliance with the provisions of AI 10-2. Therefore, if you should desire
at a later date to change the status or use of this individual, please ad-
vise Inspection and Security sufficiently in advance so that no delay is
caused in the transition.
This Office would further appreciate being advised when the contem-
plated use as set forth in your memorandum of 15 February 1950 for the sub-
ject has been completed, so that the files of this Office may be kept up
to date.

Suggestions for Mr. Baker
Re: Project Memorandum No. 35.
16 February 1950.
1. I would suggest that the following person and organizations
be invited to attend and participate in the May meeting:
a. Dr. Reinhold NIEBUER (USA)
presently at the Union Theological School, Columbia Univ-
ersity he is a member of the Commission on the Occupied
Areas and past chairman of the General Committee of world
Student Service Fund..
b. International Student Service (ISS)
c.
•
an outstanding international cultural exchange medium of
the university community (ie. both professors and students
are included) with headquarters in Geneva. This organiza-
tion was formed after the first world war and in addition
to its conference and tour activities it has been primarily
responsible for the relief work done throughout the world
in the colleges and universities. This organization is
the most prominent existing opponent of the International
Union of Students (IUS) in which the FDJ holds membership.
World Assembly of Youth (WAY)
organized recently (1948) in London this is an international
youth organization formed to counter the influence and
activities of the world Federation of Democratic Youth (WFDY)
The WFDY is comunist dominated and controlled. The FDJ is
a member of the MPDY.
2. with reference to the Project Memorandum dated 31 January 1950.
6. a. The facilities of the world Radio University (KUL) a non-govern-
mental snort-wave radio station in NYC and Boston might be used
in connection with pre-publicizing the way meeting.

Am. Ex. will accept money (check, draft or cash) in one
placo H.Y. office or in several places (Paris, for instance)
provided one central office knows details and can coordinate.
-
Will then write to all offices involved, authorizing.
transportation, etc., for list of persons (which may be
added to at last moment). We specify what credentials¨
persons must present. We also specify whether transportation
is to be by air, steamship, rail, etc.; first class or other-
wise; whether or not expenses' are to be allowed in this
connection they suggest that travelling expenses be allowed
(for meals, etc.) not to exceed 10% of transportation. They
suggest that we act as soon as practicable because of rush
for travel to Europe but r. Gilmore says they can be
reasonable cortain of providing air transportation.
-
They will render & complete accounting of transportation and
expense money provided, and remit unexpended balances.

beriving him come concorn. Hold at any
other time than in immediate juxtaposition to the
Communist Youth Rally, it would be ch. Hold at that
time it is inevitably going to be regarded as a
counter attack and in those terms a Congress of
Culture is not adequate. He wants to broaden the
bago perhaps label it a political Congress. (by
own idea, at the moment, is opposed to a political
Labol; but I agroo that a Congross for Intellectual
Freedom which could tsko in political aspects
be botter than restricting it to culturo.)

He suggests June as a date - unless we can turn out this
affair in a BIG and SIGNIFICANT enough fashion to really
offset the communist convontion. I don't know his
arguments for June but I can imagine that they would:
take the line that instead of being lost in the world
wide attention and publicity for the communist deal,
it would come as the last shot, after the communists
had exposed themselves as slaves of Moscow, and might
make a ringing effect. Also June would be the right
time for collogo people to got away from their
universities, might be very difficult in May.
He is anxious to have labor represented and suggested
a big representation from labor groups, including
Dubinsky. Also cortain leading political figures.

Meeting Sinn undan
Samples of material so far issued.
They are working on the matter of satellite representation.
Examples: Ceidrovich and Chapski from Poland; Forutka fron
Czechoslovakia; Nocolievsky and Yakofleff from Russia. Several
others.
Eleanor Roosevelt had accepted, but after appearance of MY Times
story she was seen by a reporter and was said to have stated
that she had changed her mind. Hook is also doubtful because
of his commitment to U of Cal. However, a personal letter
is going to these three, from McCloy, urgently asking them
to attend. Eelen Douglas! and Robt. Kontgomery are both
regarded as excellent prospects.
Skeggs expressed din view of Buttles' activities and is
anxious US interest and US releases be played down. However
he is anxious that there should be great deal of publicity as
time approaches. Furthermore, I got inpression that he had
inspired Buttles, to some extent at least, to take the action
in approaching Hook. For instance, Skeggs is amicus that
we consider suggestion that about the 1st or 2nd of June an
advertisement appear in NY Times and Wash. Post, signed by
large number of organizations and persons, calling attention
to Congress. He suggested this could be organized by sidney Hook
which gave me idea that he may have suggested some such activity
to Buttles, which may have resulted in Buttles' trip..
T
Details in Berlin are being crefully worked out. Delegates will
stop either at the Steinplatz or Amzoo hotel - obvious reasons for
having them all together. They will have official taxis for
their use, corridors and entrances will be guarded by plain clothes
German and US personnel, some of them will be inconspicuously
guarded personally. Meeting place Taberna Academica
be well guarded.
Matter of interpreters being worked upon, report later.
-
Hell
There will be press delegates from all countries, in addition
radio RIAS will tape the entire proceedings and will furnishi
cuttings to individual radio stations, for instance - if the
Vienna radio wants the speech of one of the Austrian delegates,
it can be provided. Rias also will be on air with reports
of proceedings, but they may need some pressure later on.
He will deliver the $200 to Hook and thinks that will be sufficient.
He and Hook and Burnham will try to work out methods of
definitely signing up certain doubtful prospects.
Feill
report to Marian Caunders and when he comes to Washington, to
Kollerman.. On my advice, he will play it straight with both - as
though he had no contact with us, says he will listen rather than
talk, but I regard that as impossible. Will assure state that
overything is going well, is completely in hands of comitice
and that all action should sten from Berlin in order to have
contral control and full coordination.
Was delighted at plans for financing travel of delegates.

made to insure fully adequate financial support;
C. That approval of the French and British High Com-
missioners for Germany should be obtained to insure tri-partite
support of the Congress and that French and British material

Your letter of December 29 was late in arriving and I am
replying by hand to save delay.
(n) The idea of a "MONA" Congress is an excellent one!
But should it be a "NCHAT" Congress or something undertaken
under the auspices of a non-government, especially a non-occupy-
☐ing government group. Perhaps the Free University can be nominal
sponser or some Europeen Fed for Cultural Freedom ed hoc.
(b) Spring is too soon to organize such & conference
properly. Suggest lete summer or fall.

(c)
To be effective conference must be tied in with 'seme
concrete issue of a cultural character in which all delegates
con agree despite their difference on other things. What
specific issue positive or negative is shaping up in Germany.
today in which leading intellectuals can take a position: The
differences among the participants, if not as great as at Peris,
will certainly be considerable, and this is not at all a bad
thing if things don't end up as they did in Paris. The min
thing, however, is to see that there is at least one major prae-
tical issue on which everyone can agree independently of dif
ferences in fighting Stalinism.

2. Arrangements for the organization of a political and psycho-

McCloy's approval. The purpose of this group is to coordinate the
activities of the various staff sections in McCloy's office in these
fields, and to develop a more intensive program of action.
3. Gearing will sit as a member of the Committee representing
SHUTE. This will give him the opportunity of being acquainted with
all overt action planned in Germany so that covert operations can be
properly coordinated with them.

I first heard of this proposal at a de-briefing outh Fischer,
which took place about three months ago. I first took a kerative view of
the proposal," which seemed to be in danger of loose and ineffective han-
dling; however, I have an entirely different opinion of such a conference
as outlined by Jesselson and under his guidance. It could, if very well
handled, furnish an opportunity for creation of morale, basis for propa-
ganda and a spring-beard for continuing effort.
2. Berlin not only is the obvious clace for the conference, it is
the only place where the impact could immediately be felt in Satellite
countries. (Berlin radio, press and personal contact with East Germany
Foland and Czechoslovakia.)
Fgree
3. Should the sponsoring committee include a woman Rossibly louise
Schroeder or Frau von Bahn-Harnack or Jeanette Wolf? I also suggest Karl-
Arnold. And would like you to consider the inclusion of a known anti-
Soviet intellectual who also is anti-U.S.
4. I think the budget should be expanded to cover the possibility that
the City of Berlin may not, or perhaps should not, provide the various halls
and opera houses free of charge; also a "convention" in Germany involves
more flowers, and music (usually a 100-piece symphony orchestra) than a
Vanderbilt Wedding. I think the over-all Berlin expense of ¥ 10,000 should
have a reserve of at least an additional 10 10,000
5. I think this proposal should, in the interest of speed, be imple-
mented as follows:
.a. A conference of representatives of CCF, CFF, SAD for quick
(24-hour) agreement in principle, so that a cable may be sent to the
`field.
b. Preparation of a Project Flan and procurement of special
assistants.

SIMS saw MUTISON in his hotel 19 March 1952
In addition to the details which he gave about "Communist Zoo" and the
"Stalin photo-book, Munson said:
Re Swen. "Tell Joe I need a man who knows the book publishing business,
a "consultant" or part time helper. To be paid something like $300 to $4,00
month, for which he would gigo, say, a week of his time each month."

Owen will reproduce material in any language, in any format. If anybody
wants him to do a Job, let them contact him,
I asked how about getting material translated; he said you can always get it
done in New York.
The finished product would be cargoed out to the field.
Re ROCKPORT, the artist. Munson has been paying him ($350 a month I think),
and now feels he has gotten about as much material out of him as he will need.
"Why not suggest to SCHILLER that The Challenge employ him on a regular basis?”
I said that the editors of The Challenge (all Russian-speaking) must already
know him, since they have used his drawings. That when he finds himself unemployed
a can, and quite likely will, approach than anyway. Why not let them decide whether
they want to employ him, rather than for us to complicate matters, through SCHILLER
by forcing this extremely "difficult" men on them? Mumson agreed we should let
it ride..
If the editors themselves want to employ him, we can then decide whether and
how much of the DTEXCISE Funds should be used to pay him As he is very difficult
and dilatory it might be better to stipulate that he be paid on a piece-work basis.

Munson said that, while the photo-books, should pay their om way, it was
contemplated that The Great Swindle would be a commercial success. Distribution
of such material is Swen's great problem,
ver
SCHILLER wrote Munson that he (FTUC) couldn't use The Great Swindle. Munson
thinks professional jealousy entered into this. SCHILLER made some criticism to
the effect that the booklet bears no Trade Union logotype, whereas he should know
perfectly well that lithographed material never does.
SCHILLER should simply be told: "Put out so many copies of the Great Swindle,
alternatively, the geographic Divisons should give indigenous Anti-Comunist
groups $25,000 or $2,500 and say: "This is yours if you mail out umpteen thousan
copies of the booklet with it."
Re State Dept and Great Swindle. Munson suggested my giving a copy of
the Great Swindle to Mrs. Crosswall or Cal. Stubbs and asking them to recommend
it to Macknight as something they had come across, with the suggestion that the
State Department buy copies of it for all their Reading Rooms,

March 22, 1951
Picture book now in high gear as layout is beginning to
take shape. New pictures of both historical and photographic
pricelessness still coming in le.g. a shot showing a wildly cheering
crowd of aussian peasants greeting first German troops---before
latter went in for mass murder) This picture never used in this
country. Could multiply by many examples but prefer to have you
come down and see for yourself. If you could be here about three
weeks com no, you could get a fairly good notion of what the
finished product will look like (although there will still be
a lot of polishing, caction writing and final checking to do).
I am now certain that the book will be a major political event.
"othing even remotely resembling it has ever been done--anywhere
in the world.
Need help on two sectors promptly:
1. Katyn massacre pictures Saw lots of them your
neck of the woods. Please send them soonest, properly packed in
cardboard to prevent folding or cracking. This is a must, since
for some odd reason this is missing from the otherwise bottomless
archives which we'be unearthed..
2. Any decent shots of anti-Communist resistance behind the
Iron Curtain. We have a few of the East German things with the "F"
painted on walls. But Joe mentioned others. Cant have too much of
tais, since it constitutes an essential element in the closing part
of the story.
'
ill be difficult to incorportate such stuff unless we
get it fast, because would mean dislocating the layout, which is
now designed to flow like a motion picture recording of the whole
big story. Hope this presents no obstacles. Joe thought your
end could send stuff to me. Rexoxone xbyc regiustx Régistered
madi sufficient precaution, it seems to me.
The Acheson lester in today's NY Times re friendship with
the Russian people a step in the right direction though still a long
way even from the speech delivered at Town Hall by McMahon day before
yesterday. But somehow, someone must teach Acheson to cut out this
sort of humbuging:
If the men of the Kremlin could but conquer their inward
fears and resolve their contradictions, if they could but
bring themselves to the comity which is the foundation
peace, great burdens would be lifted from the shoulders of
people everywhere.
•
What is the purpose of this rubbish? I know lots of professional
diplomats think this is very "cute" and arch stuff, really meant to
"embarrass" people like J.Stalin and G. Malenkov. Actually, the only
thing it can arouse, bothnamong the Kremlin war criminals and among
their victims is ---utter contempt. If anybody in Moscow takes that
drivel at face value, they conclude that the U.S. is still too frightpe
ened of the boogey man in the Kremlin to call a spade a spade. That
silly stuff must and! Please end it. The inward fears of Stalin-lial-
enkov-Beria will only be resolved on the gallows. Best regards.

STATUS OF W.S.S. PROJECTS
"STALIN" PHOTƆ-BOOK PROJECT.
This has not yet been formally written up as a project, because it
has been being implemented, de facto, by our salaried contract agent HEADLEY,
in conjunction with the publisher Swen Publishing Co., who has been meeting
the bill and will continue to do so.
Nevertheless I think it will shortly prove desirable for me to write
up, since (a) it may prove desirable for SP (under) subsidize Swet
it, in order to make possible a somewhat lower selling price, and
(b) it will be more convenient to have it wrapped up as a named project, which
can be referred to by name, and for which SP can have credit in its status
reports.
HEADLEY has completed the text part of the book. He and a top-flight
Life lay-out man, of whom he has a very high opinion (and an assistant who
helps the Life man dig up photos) have been through a very large number of
photos. HEADLEY is confident that the book will be a first-class job.
If all continues to go well on the Life front, -i.e. if they make no
objection to the use of pictures from their files the main remaining problem
will be: how to combine retention of high quality, i.e. adequate reproduction
many photos as they need to tell the story the way they feel it should
be told, with quantity, i.e. sale at a low enough price to make possible
wide dissemination.
Too heavy a subsidy (by OFC) would blow the Government-inspiration of
the book. Perhaps, if the book proves to be as good as we feel it should,
the State Department's III Information Program or Book Translation Program
might get behind it in a big way?
"
We should go energetically into this problem of selling it at a low
enough price as soon as Swen's president returns. In the meantime HEADLEY
and I are of opinion that quality should not be sacrificed. if it is of really
first-class quality and P7 effectiveness, quantity can be achieved, sokshow,
by subsidy.
HEADLEY will appear overtly as the author. Possibly the A. F. of L
might help give it world-wide distribution, as they have done in the case
the maps of the Slave Labor Camps in the USSR.
If all continues to go well, it looks as though the book might be
getting into shape for the printer in April or Hay.
When this is ritten up as a Project, it will be a Sub-project under
EMFUNNY, KUFUNIFY, approved long ago, includes a Recommendation (para
.that...the sune of $40,000 be appropriated for the development and
distribution of similar photo-books at the discretion of Chief, SP."
The Sub-project requires only the signature of Chief, SP, as I understand.
EXPENSES. Small suns were paid to HEADELEY, sumer-1950, duly recorded in

He gave me post-card (Su) by Rockport illustrating joke about
Who Owns the Automobiles". (He got this from a 13-yr-old boy in Germany in
1947, and he and an Army man each put $20 of their own into having it xx printed

Barnes was to have met him Friday (Dec. 15), but had

He expects to see Barnes tomorrow (Dec. 20), when Barnes is to deliver
about 60 of the photos with his om captions. Munson dll then let
CHAPPELL look it over for a couple of days. He will then bring it dom here
and ask Messrs. Bryan. Nadler and Sims look at it. (I told him not to resitate
to leave me out).
Barnes has been OK. I said I would check how his clearance is coming.
It was requested Nov. 2 and should be ready, says John Shields, about 3 months
from Nov. 2
Re "STALIN" PHOTO-
"T
See Shub's letter to Sims, Dec. 14, in file.
Munson also thinks it is coming well, and should be good, if the life man
continues to prove a good collaborator.
Munson does not know the name of Shub's Life collaborator: he did not
encourage Shib to tell him. Munson says he is sure SWEN is still secure,
and there is no reason why it shouldn't continue to be, "if everyone in CIA will
keep their big mouths shit; too many know about it"). SWEN may be suspected
of Government-inspiration, but it should not be blown.]
Munson has advanced Shub money to pay expenses, and has authorized kim
to pay his collaborator not more than $35 a day. The collaborator will
definitely be paid on a fixed fee basis, i.e. per diem, no royalties.
SWEN can pick up the tab for Shub's expenses in procuring photos,
That will appear in Swep's accounts, but, happily, there is no need for
KMFUNNY's files to be cluttered up with the details
LUNSON knows of the agreement, re disposition of royalties, which
SHUB (HEADLEY) signed with CIA. He has seen it; i.e., presumably has seen
the sterilized notes Shib made of it, - since Smib ratained no copy.
LUNSON understands that SHEN will own all rights to the book. I.8.,
"SHEN will simply step into the place of CIA in the above agreement." I.e.,
SWER, on paper, will be paying Shib standard royalties, but Shub will return
them to SEN,
I said that, as far as I could see, this sounded OK, SHEN being 100%
a CIA corporation. Lunson said that Joe Kelley had helped draw up the
papers setting up SHEN, and was therefore fully cognizant of it and sympa-
thetic to it. Only an excessively legal-minded bureaucrat would quibble over,
having the royalties re-absorbed by SHEN, rather than disposed of accorting

to para, 4 of the above-mentioned agreement (16 Sept. 1950), according
to which "You will be required to transfer the gross royalties to CIA...”
(This agreement was also drafted by Mr. Kelley). There doesn't seem to
be any difficulties of substance there.
There has been no decision on the size, format, etc. of the book.
I mentioned that I had written Shub, mentioning that Simon & Schuster is
able to offer its $3.95 FOR a Pictorial History - "260 photos with commentary"-
at only $1.50 in cloth.
I said Shub had written some time ago that it would be a help to
know the approximate number of photos as soon as possible, and Lyle said hẹ
of course agreed. He thought Shub and his collaborator should have something
to show in, say, 30 days. -
I mentioned that the "STALIN" PHOTO-BOOK, when written up, which I
rill do shortly, will morely be a sub-Project of KFUNNY, and will therefore
require only Hr. Thompson's signature. Lyle queried whether it was necessary
to make a formal project of it at all. I said that, for purposes of
Status Reports, etc., it would be more or less necessary to have a formal
title for it, and he agreed.
Shub has about 150 sterilized CIA Graphics photos, which we selected
last summer. None of them could actually be printed, published, without
a release from CIA Graphics. I therefore urged lunson to urge Shub to work
up a good cover story about them, vis-a-vis his collaborator. Munson said he
would advise him not to use them at all. (They are run-of-the-mine; they could
all be duplicated with ease from agencies).
=
I told Lunson that Mrs. Poland, of CIA Graphics (of whom he knows)
had personally made an arrangement with Roy
with photos from Time-Life files, but not sen, whereby he supplies them
for publication. And that she had
told me she is particularly anxious to do nothing that would undermine her
relations with Time-Life.
We agreed that, if Shub's collaborator gets permission to use photos
from Life's files in the book, it will still be a book being prepared for the
overt SMPN Company, and that life will not know the Government is involved.
Munson thinks Shub is being very circumspect about all this.

Dear Bill:
This is just a brief note to give you the latest
on the picture front. I won't fill you in on the details
because our mutual friend will be in Washington early next
week
an d will give you all the dope. Suffice it to say
that my collaboraton is one of the top layout men on Life
one of those $25,000 per annum men. For the present
be doesn't want his association with the picture book known
to his employer for several good and compaaling reasons. (Including
the fear that they would plagiarize the idea). But in the final
stages he'll have to tell them in order to get their cooperation
on digging into the ir files as well as their official permission
for the use of his name as a collaborator Needless to say
all of the above is a deep dark secret, but then what isn't
these days? More important than all of the above is the fact that
the gentleman in question, in addition to being a top flight
picture man, is deeply interested in the subject admiraculously-
actually knows a great deal about it. I hope nothing happens to
make him back down on his decision. Impossible to get anybody
nearly as qualified. Our friend will fill you in on the rest:
what remains to be done, how to do it, etc. xxxxx of one thing you
may be sure: If my collaborator stays with the project and if
no act of God intervenes, the final product will be the picture
book of all time. He wants to see it sold on newsstands among other
places.

simplest to have the actual copyright in your name alone (ho could

could be made with the minimum delay over the legal and security aspects.
If I got it right, as of July 31 you had about 100 pages in pretty
much finished form, about 70-80 pages in rougher draft, plus Chapters IV & V

you, whole-time, to do a photo-book worth doing. (Say between 100 and 200

You probably noted that "Life's WN II Picture History" occupied "the

But yours would be only 150 or 200 photos, and you have almost all the

Re The Choice". I hope the Overseas Press Club panel was a success.
Nothing in the "NY Times" about it, but they don't usually write up those
affairs. - I've seen nothing further in the "Post", xxx since the mention in
the ed I sent you; will send you anything I see.
I have a complete file, "The Choice", here, with all the reviews, etc.
in it. I went fully into the question of ordering copies, and it is clear
that it is not policy anywhere to promote the distribution of it (or for that
matter, equally clearly, any other book). After all, if the head man himself
/ Bedell Smith / had written "The Choice", there is nothing in his official
charter that would authorize him to promote it in his official capacity; on
the contrary. Nothing anywhere against you personally or the book; it's just
that there is no policy to promote any book of that side scope
Therefore, as I imagine you gathered at lunch the other day / with IST /
work in connection with "The Choice" should be during weekends and other free
time
I hope winchell's mention of it, and the good "MY Times" review, etc., will
start

is interested in it, and (3) we have already made a beginning on it, and,

completed March 1, 1950. And as of June 10, 1950 your father had had a $900
advance on it.
The copyright would be in your name, or in your father's also. I think
