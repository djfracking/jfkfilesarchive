attitude, if you did?
Mr. Halley. I certainly was aware, I think, of the broad
political trend in the Hemisphere at that time, my interest was
much more narrowly focused at that time on the Eastern European
targets, and on the Soviet target, and I was not certainly
specializing in Cuban affairs at that juncture.
Mr. Baron. Cuba was not viewed at that juncture as part of
the Soviet target, as a Soviet satellite?
Mr. Halley. No, it was not.
Mr. Baron. Coming then to February of '62, is that the
point at which you joined the JMWAVE Station in Miami?
Mr. Halley. No. When I first entered into this survey,
it was to do this on a TDY basis, temporary duty assignment;
to complete a report on my findings, to report those at that
particular juncture to Mr. Harvey who was the head of the Task
Force that was attempting to expand intelligence coverage of
Cuba and I was not assigned to the station at that particular
point in time.
Mr. Baron. At what point did you join the JMWAVE Station?
Mr. Halley. Shortly after having completed this survey.
These dates are blurred now because the survey soon turned into
a permanent assignment. I would have to check the exact dates
from my service records, but after having completed the survey
report, shortly thereafter I was asked to go to Miami to become
permanently assigned to the station in Miami. I do not recall

Is that generally a fair statement, that we were running on
a regular basis commando raids to Cuba?
Mr. Halley. Yes. There were a series of commando raids
run from the Miami Station against targets in Cuba.
Mr. Baron. Were assassination weapons, that is, high-powered
rifles with low muzzle velocity and telescopic sights, supplied
to those commando teams as a matter of course?
No, they were not.
For most of those

Mr. Baron. Such weapons, high-powered rifles with telescopic

raids conducted, some of them involved teams of fifteen or
twenty men. I am not prepared to say that no man ever had one,
but I do not recall one. You know, if you gave me an inventory
which are in the files, for each of the operations and say here
is the operation plan, does this list of equipment fifteen years
later look reasonable to you, I would be able to tell you yes
or no. But off the top of my head, I do not recall a sniper
scope or a silenced rifle.

the case would be looked at at that particular point and if he
had a Saturday Night Special, you know, there would not be any
intervention on his behalf because it had nothing to do with
his task on the behalf of CIA.
I did mention to you earlier we had training camps in various
parts of the State. If somebody came out of the training camp
and did get drunk and was picked up and did not speak English
or something and the police jurisdictions did have a way of

Mr. diGenova. How was that established, the relationship o
liaison with these jurisdictions. Had it been set up with
JMWAVE directly through Washington and down through the FBI?
How had that been done?
Mr. Halley. It varied. When we started expanding the
operation, you know, there had already been a Station there
and there also were two security units in the greater Miami
area. In some cases the existing contacts at the Station were
expanded, the same with Dade County. In other cases, the
security of personnel who had established contact with other
jurisdictions were used to effect the introduction. In some
cases, we had our security people who were on my staff go out
to these jurisdictions and identify themselves simply with a
badge and a name and discuss the kinds of things that they were

ship, so there was accountability for the weapons.
Mr. Baron. Would it have been unusual to supply what we
have called an assassination weapon to a commando team?
Mr. Halley. Well, that depends on the mission. For
instance, let me use an example.
Most of the missions that were run were run against targets
that were in fairly close proximity to the shore. If you are
going to put a party to attack your objectives, let us say the
objective was a petroleum storage tank, if you were going to do
this by putting charges up against the petroleum storage tank
that meant that you had to have a group infiltrate close

from them you would give them a second element of the commando
team which would be providing covering fire for this group in
case they got into trouble and cannot handle it on the ground.
This covering fire group might have had a light machine gun,
a Belgian weapon. They could have these kinds of weapons and
they did have these kinds of weapons" which in the definition you
are using could be used as a sniper weapon or whatever, but the
basic reason for having that weapon was to provide fire support
for the other members of the commando team. And therefore when

Mr. Baron. Did you know of any weapons drops that were
made for the purpose of supplying someone inside Cuba with a
weapon for the assassination of Fidel Castro?
Mr. Halley. No, not for that clearly stated purpose. As
I told you, we put a lot of weapons caches in. The weapons were
multi-purpose weapons, could be usęd. I know of no cache that
went in specifically for the task of playing a contributory role
to assassinating Fidel Castro.
Mr. Baron. It would not have been contrary to the policy
directives under which you were operating at the time to
11
supply such a weapon to someone inside Cuba who might have
.12
access to Castro?
13
Mr. Halley. No, it would not have been. For instance,
14
15
I can remember several resistance groups that we had that had two or
three hundred men that we were supplying on a regular basis.
16
Mr. diGenova.
Inside Cuba?

Mr. Halley. Inside Cuba, that were essentially living in
the bush to a large extent, whom we did supply weapons to and

got ammunition to them and so forth.

Mr. Baron. In the Harper's article, it says that Martinez
indicated that "More than once he was given personal charge of
weapons drops in which special rifles with silencers and tele-
scopic sights were left in designated inland spots."
Do you know of a factual basis for that statement?
Mr. Halley.
Martinez is undoubtedly factually correct when
he says he put caches on the coast of Cuba that contained weapons
9
I do not know how he would be able to tell what kind of weapons
10
were in the cache. The reason I say that is that when one of
11
13
14
15
16
17
12
these missions were planned, the cache was put together and
packed by our logistics group and once the cache was put
together it was brought on board the vessel and the cache was
then turned over to the team for infiltration so he would never
have seen the contents of the cache, he would not have opened
it up because it was always in a sealed container.
It is conceivable that in the pre-mission briefing that
18
he got before he went down that he was told that we are putting
19
20
in a cache containing a radio or putting in a
a radio or putting in a cache containing
weapons because that would influence what he selected as a
21
cache typs.
In other words, if it were a radio, we would want
22
23
it higher and drier than we would a can containing weapons that
were wraped in cosmolene and so forth. He might know that they
24
25
were weapons, but he wouldn't know that they were silenced
and they had a scope. I must honestly say to you I doubt that.

They claimed to have attacked Cuban shipping, fishing boats, and

and exploits in Cuba are well-known to anybody that has dealt
with Cuban affairs.
Mr. Baron. Do you have any knowledge of a connection
between any of these people and assassination attempts against
Fidel Castro?

and CIA and attempts to assassinate Fidel Castro.

were powerful rifles with sophisticated scopes, Springfields
with bolt action, rifles only used by snipers. They were not
sent to shoot pigeons or to kill rabbits. Everyone in the
Underground was plotting to kill Castro and the CIA was helping
the Underground. I was with the Underground as well as the CIA,
so you can see I was involved in the plots too, but that is
also obvious.'
"1
You commented before that there was a lot of talk in the
air about assassinating Castro. Martinez seems to be taking
that a few steps further, saying that there were actual plots
underway in the Cuban Underground to assassinate Castro and
that people who worked with the CIA were aware of those plots
13 and were aiding them in effect by the weapons they were
11
12
supplying.
Mr. Halley. No, I do not think I can go along with that
statement. Martinez' role as I described it to you, he is
14
15
Is that an accurate statement?

he participated in putting them in. I again question how he
would know what was in each cache. I just do not see that, and

I would have to accept that as a sort of secondhand statement
by him because of the way that the caches were put together.

kind of weapon did not go to Cuba. Maybe bolt-action

Cuba.

members of counterrevolutionary organizations,
one of the permanent goals has also been the-

The CIA, in orden to carry out its plans, has-

social origins, including samples of all types
of viciousness.

to recruting well-known leaders and members-

barred their offences, in exchange for their-
participation in the plots against our leaders.

representations in the country, which were-
used as liaisons with the Central Intelli--

These individuals were part of the organiza

directed and sponsored by that Agency.

María Leopoldina Grau was given instructions
by the CIA to plot for poisoning Primer Mi--
nister Fidel Castro, thereby, she was sent a
poisonous pill bottle, which was given to Al-
berto Cruz Caso, who, in turn, gave it to Jesús
Campanioni Souza y Santos de la Caridad Pérez
Núñez, members of the Organization (MAR) SO
that they would commit the attempted crime
at the Havana Libre Hotel.

Once more, in 1965, the Central Intelligence
Agency attempted to group the dispersed
counterrevolutionary organizations, under --
the named "Unidad Resistencia" (UNARE). In
these activities, the counterrevolutionaries
Enrique Abreu Vilahu, known as Henry, Carlos
Vicente Sánchez Hernández, Julio de las Nie-
ves Ruiz Pitaluga and others, plotted against
the Commander in Chief, taking advantage of-
his visit to Vita Nouva's restaurant, in the
Vedado. In this place, Abreu Vilahu would
open fire with a Thompson machine gun against
the Prime Minister and the guards of'the
Ministry of the Interior building located
across the restaurant, in order to create
confusion and escape.

On being arrested on July of that same year,
warlike material they had for the fulfillment

Mr. Baron. Was there any mention of any assassination
effort at that meeting?
Mr. Halley. No, there was not.
Mr. Baron. You were attending at that point in connection
with the survey you conducted?
Mr. Halley. No. I was attending at that point as the
Station Chief from Miami in order to make a contribution to the
issues that were being discussed, to the fact that detailed,
substantive back-up for whatever questions might be put to the

En 1971, con motivo del viaje del Comandan-

en ese país, para el cual se unen la CIA,
fascista chilenos y contrarrevolucionarios-
cubanos de la organización "Alpha-66".

El principal encartado en este plan era Je-

lucionarios cubanos radicados en Venezuela)
se obtuvo documentación falsa que lo acredi
taba como periodista venezolano, lo que le-
permitió cubrir la visita de nuestro Primer
Ministro en dicho país.

El plan se ejecutaría mediante una pistola-

On 1971, due to Commander in Chief's trip to
Chile, a plot was elaborated in that country
for which the CIA, the Chilean fascists and-
Cubans counterrevolutionaries from "Alpha (66")
organization came together.
The major indicted in this plan was Jesús Do
mínguez Benítez, known as "The Islander".
Through Cuban counterrevolutionaries settled
down at Venezuela, he obtained false documents
which identified him as a Venezuelan newspaper
man, which permitted him to report our. Prime-
Minister's visit in that country.
The plan would be carried out using a gun
camouflaged into a television camera, but
they gave this up on considering there were
no guarantees for the preservation of their
lives.
Domínguez Benítez, belonged to the "Poder Cu
bano" terrorist organization. He was accused
by the American authorities of promoting
terrorist actions inside the United States
and other countries, as a member of that or-
ganization, and was arrested by the FBI in

No obstante, queda en libertad y sale sin difi

However, in 1970 he participated in the

before.
Nevertheless, he is set free and leaves
United States without any difficulty, and -
moves to South America in order to partici-
pate in the plot. Afterwards, he returns to

that the CIA has carried out aimed to the
assassination of the leaders of the Revolutio

they could make it available to the Special Group sometime in

operation in terms of sensitivity, and then you could move up
from team infiltrations that had to be approved in advance,
resupply missions, paramiltary operations against fixed instal-

Mr. Baron. If there had been any operation with the
assassination of Fidel Castro, or other high Cuban government
leaders as its objective, would such an operation have been
referred to either the three-man group or later the Special
Group.
Mr. Halley. If such an operation had been proposed from
Miami, it would have had to have gone through that particular
process.
Mr. Baron. Your answer seems to indicate that only
operations that originated at the JMWAVE Station would be
referred up for approval. Is that correct?
Mr. Halley. That is the kind of activity that I have
firsthand knowledge of. When I became the Station Chief, I told
you my time at this was essentially February of 1962 through

I know that shortly thereafter I was in Miami, General
Lansdale came down to visit me, to talk with me, about the
progress that was being made in the operational program.
some point after that, this three-man group for all intents
and purposes disappeared. General Lansdale was reassigned;
the group broke up; subsequent reviews of the program were made
at the Special Group level. As an example, we would have to
submit every month the number of operations that we were going
to run, such as infiltrations into Cuba through what would be
paramilitary means, and these were approved by the Special

I am aware that the chronology of the 303 Committee, Special

earlier, that particular time, I cannot distinguish between
whether this was an ad hoc meeting or this was a Special Group
meeting, or what it was.
Mr. Baron. Did you assume at that time that the three-man
group that you referred to, including the Attorney General,
General Lansdale and Richard Helms, had a formal relationship
to this larger Special Group? In other words, was that three-
man group a kind of decision-making sub-unit of the Special
Group, or do you think it operated entirely independent from
the National Security Council structure.
Mr. Halley. I do not think I can give you an authoritative
answer to that. I would go back to what I previously told
you. When I entered into this project in February of 162, the
chain of command that I was familiar with was this three-man

Would you say that every major operation that you undertook
at JMWAVE would have been approved by the Special Group or at
least they would have been put on notice of the nature of any
major operation that you were planning?
Mr. Halley. Why do you not define for me what you consider
to be a major operation so we do not get into, you know, a
11 problem? If you feel that you cannot.do that.

Group later, for their approval, or at least to put them on
notice, the kinds that you might not refer and instead proceed
unilaterally?
Mr. Halley.
Initially, the three-man group was seized
with the problem of conducting the survey of what could be
done against Cuba. As soon as that was more or less agreed
upon, my understanding of this, as I told you, the three-man
group was disbanded or atrophied or went on to other things
and then the formal mechanism came in for approval, that is,
the Special Group. As procedures. became more formalized, we
had to submit a monthly schedule of the kind of operations that

the Western Hemisphere Division, who at one time was FitzGerald.
Mr. Baron. But a plan that originated at the CIA above
the level of the Chief of Station at JMWAVE would not necessarily
have been referred to Special Group for approval, is that
correct?
Mr. Halley. I have no firsthand knowledge of that, there-

'personal knowledge of. In other words, that is the kind of
thing that I think you should talk to, you know, those who were

perception of that.

Mr. Halley. That is what bothers me, because I did not
put forth any plans. On the other hand, I do not want to be

Any number of these people had plans or ideas for changing the

This was something that was talked about, you could go down to
any coffee house in downtown Miami and Cubans would be talking
that kind of language.
So I do not want to leave you with the impression that the
word assassination never came across my radar screen, but we
are talking about, and my answer was geared to a planned opera-

requirements, he was taking them from the three-man group and

Mr. Halley.
Right, and I will stand by my answer; that is,
I put forth no plans, I know of no plans put forth, you know,
during my tenure in Miami in which assassination was part of
the operational rationale. You know, the only way we can clarify
this perhaps to your satisfaction is to discuss some specifics.
If you are prepared to talk about specifics, maybe I can deal
with those within the framework of that general statement that
I made, you know. I know how Cubans talk. I know the rumors
9 that have existed over the years. I simply do not want to be
identified with any action conducted by some group over which
I had no knowledge or control. That is my key point.
Mr. Baron. I think that answers it for now, and we will

one hand, the Agency chain of command from the DDP to Harvey
to you at JMWAVE, and on the other hand, the three-man decision

Helms. Would you say in the early days that this three-man
19
group appeared to you to be in control of the decision making
20 before the Special Group stepped in, that decisions were made
in a less formal way than they were later under the Special
Group?

Returning to your statements about the chain

Therefore, I never dealt with this three-man group as a
body. I dealt with the individuals, you know, and various
mutations.
Mr. Baron. Would you say that the three-man group had a
less formal, more free-wheeling style of decision making, and
there was a real change in the rigor with which you were required
to report after the Special Group took over?
Mr. Halley. I would have to say that the total reporting
became more formalized the longer we stayed in business. I

I cannot remember a specific date, you know, some time at

Mr. Baron. Again, I am not trying to unfairly pull these

yourself and Helms?

Mr. Halley. Again, I put it in this overall context of
'
the times. We were running Foreign intelligence collection tas
operations against Cuba with classical agent means. We were running
.collection against Cuba through paramilitary teams. We were
involved in paramilitary operations that could be described as
14
commando raids. Those were the kinds of activities.
15
16
17
18
19
We were dealing with exile groups, we were debriefing
refugees and in all of this conversations of assassination,
the Cuban penchant for it had to come up. I cannot pinpoint
Mr. Baron. You do not recall any reference of means to
be used or people to be involved?
20
Mr. Halley. No.
Even such things as discussions of
21
22
23
24
25
various kinds of weapons, you know, people, as you probably
know from this experience, every individual who deals with
weapons has a different view on what is the ideal weapon. If
you took a squad of ten men and gave them the free choice, I
am sure all ten of them would come up with a different weapon.

Therefore, when we were standardizing weapons to our

Therefore the term assassination was just a part of the life,

across. I just cannot articulate any more eloquently than
that.
Mr. Baron. I think you are being quite eloquent and
extremely informative.

in some of these conversations the mood of the community, the

subject of assassinations undoubtedly came up.
This was part

of the life of that particular period.

Mr. Halley.
I think what I would like to do is to try to

The perspective really starts with the failure of the Bay

Kennedy Administration wanted another look taken at the problem
of Cuba. In order to get that other look started, the Kennedy
Administration created this three-man task force or this three-

Cuba, and that is when I came into this problem in February of
11 162.

Mr. Baron. Is it possible that the three-man group that
you are referring to is actually the Robert Kennedy-Maxwell
Taylor Board of Inquiry into the reasons for the failure of the
Bay of Pigs operation?
Mr. Halley. This three-man group stemmed out of that
inquiry. What its relationship was to the inquiry, I do not know,.
because I was not involved and I never had an opportunity once
I plunged into this job, to go back and read those historical
documents.
You know, I am sure there is a Maxwell Taylor Report,
and so forth; but I have never read it.
All right.
Therefore, my first task when I became involved in this
was the task of coming up with an operational plan to see what
kinds of intelligence could be collected in Cuba, so that by

Therefore, while they were brave and dedicated,
they were the kind of people who would probably engage in
something like this in the context of using the sniper weapon
as a vehicle for assassination, long distance.
Therefore, in this context you are talking about range, you
know, one of the key factors becomes what is the accurate range

of a weapon if fired by an expert marksman.
Therefore, that is
11
the kind of thing that would go into, you know, discussions of
12
weapons.
Mr. Baron.
13
When you were discussing weapons with high

15

range and low muzzle velocity, was this ever discussed in the
context of shooting Fidel Castro or other key Cuban leaders as
opposed to targetted shooting on a commando raid.

Mr. Halley. I can recall, you know, no conversation in
which it was narrowly focused on the question of Fidel Castro.
Let us go back, then, to putting this all

people felt that the Cuban penchant for assassination, for
discussing assassination, was the kind that would have to be
done from a long range.
You know, I think that it is generally an accepted thesis

on hard facts as to what could be done against Castro.
In other

Therefore, this was an attempt to start the collection of

In order to collect intelligence at that particular time,
it was believed that all avenues of approach should be used,
so that meant classical foreign intelligence operations,
counterintelligence operations, the debriefing of refugees, and
the use of paramilitary means to put teams into Cuba to collect
intelligence on that part of the island that could not be
covered by what you would call the more classical means of
14 foreign intelligence collection.

that were not in the Army.
9

Mr. Baron.
What kinds of elements were those?
Mr. Halley.
These were paramilitary forces that were in
13
14
Cuba, that we had put in or established contact with, or people
who were already in the bush who we had already established
contact with or they had established contact with us, and we
15 were providing them with food, weapons and so forth so that they

of hard intelligence, as it turned out to be, was a U-2

He never articulated that to us in those terms.
Then we got caught up into the eyeball to eyeball confron-
tation of the Cuban Missile Crisis. When that was over, we
got caught up with the problem of monitoring the disengagement
of the Soviet presence in Cuba. That took us up through sometime
time
into early '63.
Then we took a look again, because we knew an awful lot
more about them than we had when we started in February of '62,
because that was something that was excluded by the Khruschev-
9
10
to see what could be done against Cuba, and it was clear at
11
that point that no external invasion was going to be possible,

14
15
16
17
In any event,
therefore it was a question of what could be done. So we were
collecting intelligence to continue to stay on top of the
situation. We were attempting to establish contacts with the
military establishment in Cuba to see if there was any force
that was opposed to Castro within the military establishment
that would be used to alter the situation and continue to see
18
19
20
whether there were any economic pressures that could be brought
21
22
on Cuba that would accelerate the whole problem of creating
an environment in which a resistance could be created on an

Mr. Baron. Did you have other agents or operatives among
the Cuban community or outside the Cuban community that were
affiliated with the Station although not employed by it
directly?
Mr. Halley. I think we are going to have to define some
terms.
Mr. Baron. What I am trying to do now is simply get a
picture of the scope of the Station's strength and in its
activities, how many people the Station had to call upon for
its activities.

Mr. Halley.

Well, let me try to give you an answer, becaus
I think we are going to get into a semantic problem here.
When I talk about the Station, as such, I would say that
is roughly in the neighborhood of three hundred people, and that 21
22
was those people who would be involved in the management

effort, the direction effort, the financial logistics, cover
procedures, security, that kind of thing.

people who were not knowledgeable necessarily of whom they

worked for or where the cover offices were located and so forth.
Let us say, in the maritime part of the operation we might have
had at any one point in time, you know, up to five hundred
people involved in maritime activities, you know?
Again, if you pick a date, I am sure we can research it.
The records are still available and you know how many people
we had, but let us take these five hundred. What am I talking
about? These would be essentially Cubans who were the captains
of the vessles that were used in infiltration operations to
put people on the shore of Cuba, and there were a variety of
techniques. In other words, you might start on with the mother
ship, which would be an LCI

This is the kind of ship that would take fuel supplies and

So you might start with an operation of a mother ship towing a

smaller boat, or having it on its decks and going down to
fifteen or twenty miles from Cuba, putting the smaller boat

over the side, which was a faster boat, lower silhouette, less
likely to be picked up by Cuban coastal radar, and then that
would take the team in close to the shore where we might finally

of the fabric of the times.
Mr. Baron. Can we turn now to the structure of the JMWAVE
Station and explain that a bit? How large was the Station?
What was the command structure within the Station?
Mr. Halley. The Station started expanding in whatever
timeframe it was, somewhere after the survey was completed.

employees at the Station during its peak?
Mr. Halley. I would say somewhere in the neighbordhood of,
you know, three hundred. You know, again, this means staff and 21
contract employees.

(Discussion off the record.)
Mr. Baron. To continue with this, I understand that
45
safety regulations would have been complied with, but was there
q some sort of immunity from inspection, say inspection for
5
carrying armaments aboard a vessel that the CIA had arranged
6
with maritime authorities, or local law enforcement authorities?
7
8
Mr. Halley. When we had operations going, these were
coordinated with the Coast Guard in terms of their knowing that,
9 you know, at a particular date, time group, that there would be
10
11
12
a rendezvous between two vessels which were our vessels, and
this was coordinated with the Coast Guard.
Mr. Baron.
Would you return to the second part of that
13 large question?
Without reference to vessels, were CIA
14 employees or agents on the streets of cities in Southern
15 Florida immune from search or arrest by local law enforcement
16
17

authorities?
Mr. Halley. They were not immune.
Let me ask to dispel one myth that I think has developed
which is reflected in your question. We were meticulous to
insure that no weapons were issued to anybody until the men
were on the vessel outside of the immediate waters of south
Florida, and we were meticulous to insure that when they came
back from a mission that they were met at sea and all the
weapons were taken away from them.
So, when you talk about a group moving around in Florida,

Mr. Baron. The people involved in manning those crafts
would not necessarily be employees of the Station directly?
They might be agents, even non-paid agents?
Mr. Halley. No, they were not paid.
For instance, they
7
might work for a particular cover company. In other words, I
8 am only using this as an example. Let us say we had the ABC
9 Shipping Company. That shipping company was a subsidiary of
10
the Station, if you will, and the ABC Shipping Company ran

personnel or with equipment?
Mr. Halley. We are talking about all of these companies,

to companies that were proprietaries.

This was all carefully controlled and they did not have their

so they were not immune.
Mr. Baron. You did have general arrangements or agreements
with law enforcement agencies throughout Florida for the
treatment of CIA operatives who were affiliated with the JMWAVE
Station?
Mr. Halley. We did have, through our Office of Security,
a continuing dialogue with a number of law enforcement agencies
in Florida. If a problem developed, we would then contact them
and look at the issue within the context of what had transpired.
Certainly there was no immunity. In other words, this has to be
looked at on a case by case basis.
19
20
For instance, you know, we had a training site in north
'Florida, as an example. If somebody came off of that site that
21

was drunk and disorderly in town

Mr. Halley. Let me try to divide that and deal with each

Let me first deal with the vessels. Every vessel that we

had was appropriately registered.
There were no short-cuts:
insofar as the U.S. Coast Guard was concerned.
That is, any

vessel that was registered in the United States met appropriate

safety standards and so forth, so we were not putting any

the water. That is we are talking about ten, fifteen, twenty
foot boats, thirty foot boats, thirty-five foot boats, things
like that. These boats were owned in either a corporate name
or by a private individual who had to register them with the
Coast Guard and pass normal Coast Guard regulations.

with the Station a moment ago, I think we may have created a
misimpression that the only people involved in CIA operations
were people who were paid by the Agency. Isn't it also true
that there were many members of Cuban exile groups in Florida
who participated voluntarily from time to time in CIA sponsored
operations?
Mr. Halley. I think that you may have to sharpen that up

Let me make sure that we understand each other, because
during this period of time there were a lot of independent
Cuban groups who claimed that they had sponsorship from the
Agency but did not, and were operating, and there was a period
in time when these groups could not run their operations from
Florida without running the risk of being picked up by Customs,
Immigration, Coast Guard, the FBI, or if we had information on
it, you know, we might pass the information to the Coast Guard

things as England bus exports from Great Britain to Cuba.

Harvey would come, you know, to Miami, to visit me

go off on his own and make his contact with whomever he was

me to find out with whom he was meeting or why he was meeting
them or what he was doing with them.
Mr. Baron. My question really was, I think more innocent
than that.

techniques would be, or what kind of knowledge the Chief of
Station of JMWAVE would have to have in order to do an effective
job in dealing with the Cuban community and running operations

During the period of your tenure. If there

There were. Each one is different.
Let me
14
give you a couple of examples.
15
Washington, Task Force W, essentially did not run
16
17
18
any paramilitary operations where they took command and control
for sending people to Cuba. For instance, if Task Force W in
Washington wanted to plant a radio in Cuba which was to be picked

Continuing.--And then it continues to say a large shopping
list of arms and equipment, which cost about $5,000 and were
supplied in a parking lot of a drive-in restaurant in a rented
U-Haul truck.
Would the cost of $5,000 have been an unusual expenditure
at that time at JMWAVE Station for arms and equipment?
Mr. Halley. No, $5,000 would not have been an unusual
expenditure.
Mr. Baron. Not unusual enough, in fact, for you to have
a particular memory of the event?

is my understanding of the agreement that we entered into prior
to this conversation going on the record.
Mr. Baron. Thank you.
Let us begin then with some very broad questions
about your background in the Agency. Can you tell me what you
were doing in the Agency prior to your involvement with the
JMWAVE station?
Mr. Halley. I became involved with the Cuban affair in
approximately February of 1962. At that time, I was in Head-
quarters.
I was Chief of Foreign Intelligence Activities for the
Eastern European Division. I was asked to be released from those
duties to conduct a survey of the opportunities for running
intelligence operations against Cuba. I was released from those
20 duties; I did engage in a survey of the possibilities for running
intelligence, counterintelligence, paramilitary operations
21

against Cuba.
Mr. Baron. Your position as Chief of Foreign Intelligence
for Eastern Europe did not involve Cuba in any way? That was
your last position before you became involved in Cuban affairs,

in some sort of caper involving a U-Haul truck.

Mr. Baron. At that time, if Harvey had made a request of
you to supply $5,000 worth of equipment like explosives,
detonators, .30 caliber rifles, .45 caliber handguns, radios
and boat radar, would you have supplied that equipment to Harvey

Mr. Halley. Yes, I would have supplied it to Harvey or
to his designated representative, depending on how that person
identified himself to me with the equipment that he requested.
That was my chain of command and, if he had told me that he
had wanted this material for any operational activity, I would
have seen to it that it was issued to him. That is the way the
Agency functions.
Mr. Baron. Would it have been standard procedure in a
paramilitary operation to procure equipment that would not have
been traceable to the United States as the IG Report indicates
was done in this case?
Mr. Halley. It depends. It depends on what was the
sponsorship that was trying to be conveyed to the paramilitary
group.
In other words, let us say there was a Venezuelan business-
man who may have been giving some assistance to a Cuban exile
group. If somebody had gotten in touch with that Venezuelan
businessman and he was saying I brought weapons into Florida

Undoubtedly, there were some

operation. I was not fully focused on Cuban operations until
approximately February of 1962.
Mr. Baron. At what point. did you join the Agency?
Mr. Halley.
I joined the Agency originally in 1951.
Mr. Baron. In a very general way, can you describe the
nature of your activities at the Agency prior to February of 1627
Mr. Halley. When I was first assigned to the Agency, I was
an Army officer on active duty. I went through the usual Agency
training program. I was assigned to Eastern European activities
where I originally was focused on Polish and German operations.
I subsequently served from 1952 to 1959 in Germany. In the
course of that service, I spent most of my time working on the
Eastern European satellites, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary,
Romania, Bulgaria. In addition, I was involved on occasion in
Soviet operations and East German operations.
Mr. Baron. Did you have any involvement in Latin American
affairs prior to February of 162?
Mr. Halley. Yes. In the period 1960-62, I was responsible
24 for setting up operational activity in Latin America that
25
was targetted more explicitly on the Eastern European satellites

'the nature of our approach to the military establishment in
Cuba. In the context of that conversation, Mr. FitzGerald asked
me if I thought whether it would be a good idea for him to meet
one of these Cuban military personalities, and he subsequently
identified to me the personality he was talking about was
AMLASH-1.

My advice to him was that it would probably not be a good
idea for him to meet him, and the only thing that I could see
coming out of that kind of a contact would be that he, Mr.
FitzGerald, would get a personal feel for what makes some of
these people tick, in human terms, and that that probably was
too high a price to pay for the prospect if anything went wrong,
7
an individual as prominent in Washington as, both within the

number of which could have been used for sniper type activities.

FitzGerald and his staff were working on what I was doing in

In other words, we saw this as a multi-faceted approach.
First,
we wanted penetrations of the Cuban military so that we could
5 collect intelligence. What were their strengths, weaknesses,
60
6
what was their mood, where were things going? Secondly, we
11
.12
13
7
wanted from these sources operational intelligence. Who
--
in

consolidated. Who could provide leadership for a counter-

10 movement against Fidel?
We were looking for people, once we had identified them,
to see if we could establish contacts with any of these leaders
so we could see whether there was a basis for working toward
14
an overthrow of the Castro government.
You know, those were
15
the basic steps.
16
17
Now as you got down to talking about how you overthrow
Castro, obviously the question comes in of how does a group who

wants to run a coup or take power take power, and obviously
one of the things that has to be looked at is where does the

Mr. Halley. I think I may have read one or two volumes
of whatever my question was at the time, because these cases
keep coming up. You know, there must have been some inquiry
at the time that necessitated my looking at the folder or
discussing it with my staff and so on.

Mr. Halley. As a concept, the Artime thing was looked at
as another track, an approach to the overall Cuban problem to
see if they could sort of do it on their own. If they could
simply be given, you know, X number of dollars, some equipment,
some guidance, and give them an opportunity to find a Cuban
solution to what was a Cuban problem. That was also, you know,

to you, the conversations with FitzGerald, Madrid, newspaper
articles, so forth, in that particular timeframe.
Mr. Baron. Did the CIA to your knowledge use any gambling
Syndicate contacts inside Cuba or people outside Cuba who were
connected to gambling interests inside Cuba for any operational
purpose including the intelligence gathering?
Mr. Halley. The only case that I recall is this case that

the Cuban problem. He was one of two such activities that were
run at the time. And therefore I think that your statement is
correct that perhaps he was set up so that there could be no
direct attribution in his activities to the United States,
because he set up a base in Nicaragua, and the story as I recall
it was put out that he was receiving assistance from the
Nicaraguan government, and therefore there was a part of the
whole cover story, if you will, for him.

So, yes, there was an attempt to set him up as a parallel

my perspective, that was geared towards an assassination
operation, because that was a fantastically large operation
involving lots of people, you know, with substantial amounts of

where the Eastern European satellites were expanding their

Division, I was responsible for getting this program going in
Latin America, so I did have an extensive exposure to Latin
America: in the period '60 to '62, as I recall those dates.
The accuracy of those dates can be checked from my official
travel records, and so on.

During that period of time you were actually

coordination with an asset in New York named QJWIN and I think
that period of greatest activity was in 1962 and WIN was
involved in spotting potential assets among the criminal under-
world in Europe and might be used for any number of dirty

Let me quote you a passage here and see if it
comports with our discussions earlier of special arrangements

The article says: "All the boat missions to Cuba were tech.

a small boat could not recover its position and get back to the

would ask to have their case referred to a particular individual

Now the third group was Customs. Customs did have a
