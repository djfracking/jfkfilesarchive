Talking Paper for Briefing Chairman Stokes,
HSCA, on KITTY HAWK
1.
The Chief Counsel of the House Select Committee on
Assassination, Mr. G. Robert Blakey, has requested access to
"all reports and documents referring to an operation code
named KITTY HAWK," which Mr. Blakey describes as "a project
concerning the debriefing of a Soviet defector and a KGB
analysis of the Kennedy assassination.' You propose to
provide Chairman Stokes an oral response to this request.
"
2. Chairman Stokes may be informed that "KITTY HAWK"
is not a defector but is a very sensitive in-place KGB source
with whom we have not had recent contact but who is known to
be alive and well. There has been some mention of KITTY HAWK
in the press in connection with the current investigation of
the fate of Nicholas SHADRIN, an FBI-CIA double agent who
disappeared in 1975 while in Vienna for a meeting with the
KGB.
In spite of the unfortunate publicity, however, KITTY
HAWK has apparently been able to survive KGB scrutiny thus
far, and we continue to abide by the Director's statutory
obligation to protect his identity.
3. We have reviewed our holdings on KITTY HAWK and have
found no reference to any "KGB analysis of the Kennedy
assassination" or any other information pertinent to the
Committee's interest. Discussion of the assassination of

President Kennedy took up only a small portion of the time
spent in debriefing KITTY HAWK. You may wish to inform
Chairman Stokes that in 1966 KITTY HAWK volunteered his
impression that Kennedy's assassination "was planned and
carried out by VIP's, possibly due to Kennedy's opposition
to Texas oil interests." He added that he believed that the
KGB was embarking on a "disinformation" campaign to have
the assassination blamed on President Johnson, but he had no
specific details of this campaign. KITTY HAWK also said that
he was "personally well acquainted" with Lee Harvey Oswald's
background because he had helped prepare the file on Oswald
which was turned over to the United States Government by
the Soviet Government. KITTY HAWK was not questioned further
on this point, and there is no further reference in the
KITTY HAWK file to any KGB or Soviet Government activity with
respect to the assassination.
4. Although strictly speaking it is not relevant to this
inquiry, you should be aware of the fact that KITTY HAWK supported
Nosenko's bona fides by reporting that Nosenko had done the
KGB considerable damage (more than Golitsyn) and that the KGB
was looking for Nosenko and intended to kill him if they found
him. This is pertinent because those who hold to the theory
that Nosenko was a plant tend also to subscribe to the belief
that any KGB source or defector who supported Nosenko's bona
fides was also KGB-controlled. Introduction of KITTY HAWK
into the assassination controversy can only serve the purpose
of obfuscation.
