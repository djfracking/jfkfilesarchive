OCCURRENCE:
With regard to paragraph 2 of Lansdale's memorandum to SGA dated 14 Nov.
1962 Harvey states: "The statement that Operation Mongoose had had no information on
this operation since early October was patently false. Specific references made to the
pen ultimate paragraph and Lansdale's memorandum concerning a report for the CIA which he
used as a basis for memorandum dated 31 Oct. 1962 to Oswald Kirkpatrick. This refers to
a telephonic conversation on the evening of 30 Oct. 1962 between Lansdale and Cheever
which is referred specifically in paragraph 2 on pages 7 and 8 of my reference memorandu.
I have discussed this matter in detail with Cheever and clearly recollects that his
conversation with Lansdale on that date took place as reflected in my reference memorandum.
During this conversation there was no discussion of previous operations except a brief
discussion of the COBRA and AMTORID teams and Lansdale did not ask, according to Cheever's
recollection, any specific questions concerning assets inside or prior operations which

OCCURRENCE:
The planning for Operation MONGOOSE was prepared on a format of separate
planning for each department and agency involved. Revised planning along that line was
submitted with this memorandum. Activities already approved were marked with an asterisk.
Approved were dispatching one intelligence agent operation to a key area selected by the
CIA, ("Many of the agents infiltrated into Cuba will be trained for paramilitary skills
as well as intelligence collection,...However, CIA has noted that, once the agents are
inside Cuba, they cannot be controlled effectively from outside Cuba, although every effort
will be made to attempt such control.") (00207), Carribbean Admissions Center Copa-Locka,
Florida. Periodic intelligence estimates, continued negotiating for British help in con-
taminating locamotive lubricants, two teams of agents dispatched to Cuba approved for
March 16-31, 1962, develop intelligence potential of Cuban "colonies" in U.S., develop
additional interrogation centers in other areas by 31 March 1962 in South America and

Helms testified that the aim of the Cuban operations was "to
get rid of Castro or the Castro regime in Cuba; lets put it that way, and no
limitations were placed on the means. In fact, I never recall having been told by
anybody do not do this, do not do that, do not do the other thing." (26) (The
above statements refer to Mongoose.) Helms testified that "the pressure was very
intense and I remember vividly it was very intense." The pressure led to several
"very nutty schemes." (26) Helms testified the pressure built up to the Bay of Pig:
and then lay dormant for awhile and intensified again toward the end of 1961 and
1962. The Cuban Missile Crisis itself was the period of greatest intensity. After-
wards interest tapered off, although Helms recalled efforts in 1963 involving
"economic warfare" such as turning off oil deliveries and stopping bus deliveries
including an attempt to stop the sale by theLeyland Bus Company in Spain of buses to
Cuba. SOURCE:

"CIA has initiated action to contaminate POL supplies for Cuba, although visible results
(stopage of some Cuban transports) is not expected until mid-1962. CIA is introducing
"lubzol," a corrosive additive to Cuban locomotive diesel fuel oil (through commercial
suppliers in Beligium. A similar project was noted for jet fuel storage tanks in Cuba.
Lansdale noted that the CIA had concluded that its realistic role should be to at least
create the illusion of a popular movement, to win external support for it, to improve
CIA operational capability, and to help create a climate which will permit provocative
actions in support of a shift to overaction. Lansdale wanted them to reevaluate
to see whether or not they could make a greater effort. An outline of what the 33 tasks
are for each of the entitities involved then follows in Lansdale's memo. The memorandum
notes that the President directed that the Chief of Operations conduct the project through
the appropriate organizations and departments of the government. In this regard the memo
notes "Also, CIA apparently believes that its role should be to create and expand a popular

Cuban exile jeweler in New York City), in Copenhagen (85). WAINWRIGHT reported
