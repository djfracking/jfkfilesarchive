but he did not contact the Station. (See MEXICO
CITY-7974.)
˚ B.
LICARD-1: LICARD-1 returned from his TDY
to Madrid in October. His mission was unsuccessful.
The Hadrid Station provided detailed reports on
this operation.
c. LISAGA-1: LISAGA-1 returned to Xexico on
25 November 1968. He remained in Mexico to receive
special training and to undergo debriefing by a
Headquarters TDYer until 9 December, when he returned
to PBRUMEN.
D. Subject of MEXICO CITY-6266: LIADLIB-1
finished his debriefing of Subject during this period.
(See A-55618 )
E. · HAGLIDER-1: HAGLIDER-1 did not return to
Nexico during this period.
F. YJWAIT-2: YJWAIT-2 did not return to Nexico
during this period.
G. Subject of MEXICO CITY-7595: Subject
defected to the Mexicans during the Olympics. The
Station arranged for a press conference through
LITAMIL-3. LITAMIL-3's debriefing revealed that
Subject did not have any intelligence of value.
(See also NEXICO CITY-7621.)
H. AWILLOW-1: AILLOW-1 arrived in Mexico
on 22 November and returned to PBRUMEN on 2 December.
FRADYER could not meet him as he was at Headquarters
on TDY. (See XEXICO CITY-8215 and -8335.)
3.
Active Leads to Prospects in PBRUMEN:
A.
LICOMET-21
Subject of MEXICO CITY-5442:
received a call from Subject on 24 November asking
him to take care of two friends who were visiting
Eexico fron PBRUMEN. During the same call, Subject
indicated he would be coming to Xexico City soon on
vacation and would notify LICONET-2 of the exact
date and details.
*
}
B. AMICARUS-1: After enlisting the cooperation
of AMICARUS-3 in Veracruz, the Station is awaiting
the arrival of AMICARUS-1, scheduled to transit
Mexico City from PBRUMEN, to re-establish contact
between the two and have AMICARUS-3 develop AMICARUS-1.
(See NEXICO CITY-8136, et cetera.)
c. ANCAJOLE-2: Per MEXICO CITY-7451 and -7453,
ANCAJOLE-1 was scheduled to visit Mexico from PBRUMEN

D. DIALMANAC-1: LIALMANAC-1 told ROFTOX on
23 November that he is a close, long-time friend of
the Subject of HA-36016. He says now he believes
he can develop a close relationship with QUOON, I
Nexico City. ·
E. Subject of MEXICO CITY-7946: The Station
is cooperating with LNERGO in preparing for, the
arrival of Subject's son in Mexico. The Station
has assisted in getting a Mexican visa for the son.
The son arrived in Mexico on 2 December, but it has
not yet been determined whether he is willing to i
be contacted and, hopefully, debriefed.
4. Legal Travelers to PBRUMEN:
A. LIRING-4: According to LIRING-3, LIEING-4
is in no condition to accept any assignment or
instructions for a trip to PBRUMEN. There is,
however, some possibility that LIRING-3 may go to
PBRUMENN on a "cultural" mission, at which time he
will report directly to PBRUMEN officials on his
activities in Guatemala. LIRING-9 has reiterated'
that he wants both LIRING-3 and LIRING-4 to go. but
has not suggested dates for this travel. (See
MEXICO CITY-8159 and -8228.)
B. LIRENO-2: LIRENO-2's papers are finally.
in order, and she has indicated that she is still
willing to travel to PERUMEN. However, the recent
death of her mother, as well as the recent incar-
ceration of her son (in a frame-up by his employer
see MEXICO CITY-8182), has brought her to a physical
and psychological low. The Station is allowing her
time to recuperate before raising the question again.
C. LIANKLE-1: LIANKLE-1 has not yet settled
in Mexico City. There was no contact with her
during this period.
-
D. LIARN-1: Per MEXICO CITY-7433, LIARK-1
was met during the Olympics, but did not have access
to much information of value. (See MEXICO CITY-7563
and -7741.) In spite of the fact that he was in
daily contact with PBRUNEN participants, some of whom
spent considerable time with him, he came up with
virtually nothing. The Station, at present; has no
contact with LIARM-1, who has returned to the
Monterrey area.
1
E. Subject of MEXICO CITY-5853 (News contact
of LITAMIL-3): Subject has been reapproached about.
making a trip to PBRUNEN now that the Olympics are
over. He has indicated his willingness to make such
a trip now. LITAMIL-3 is arranging a meeting between
Subject and a Station Case Officer.
F. LIRENO-8: On 17 October LIRENO-8 was
instructed to actively arrange for a trip to PERUMEN,
and, if he goes, to see about taking some courses
in that country. (See NEXICO CITY-7738 and MMA-35593.).
In the meantime, he has become completely integrated
into the PBRUNEN Consulate and cultural institute -
in his town. In this capacity he will be in a i
position to report on PBRUMEN activities in that area.

G. Trash Operation: The trash operation was
not reactivated during this period.
H. Audio Against the Residences of LIRING-21
and LIRING-24: Via LIPEALM-1 the Station located
empty apartments in the same buildings where these
two LIRING officers live. Attempts to rent at least
one of these for an audio operation proved difficult
in view of the need for a cosigner and finding
suitable people to move in. LIROSIN-1 was going to
attempt to make some arrangement when the LP described
in subparagraph 5F turned up. The Station' decided
the latter was of higher priority and discontinued
its efforts to rent the apartments next to LIRING-21
and LIRING–24.
6.
Physical Penetration and Coverage of LIRING:
A.
PBRUMEN Deputy in Merida: This target
left PCS on 15 November 1968. (See MEXICO CITY-8148.)
B. LITAMIL-7: The Station had no contact with
LITAR-7 ouring this period.
Sut was, however,
seen chatting with LIRING members on several occasions.
She was not observed visiting LIRING.
t
C. Female Access Agent (Subject of MEXICO
CITY-5988): No contact was established during this
period.
D. LIRING-3/LIRING-4: On 29 October ROTTON
Eet LIRING-3 after his release from jail. The
results of the initial debriefing were cabled in
MEXICO CITY-7900. LIRING-3 indicated that LIRING-4
was very nervous and upset, and that he wanted all
his own activity and association with RONTON to be
kept from her. LIRING-3 has been mecting fairly
frequently with LIRING-9, who has been debriefing
him on his encarceration in Guatemala. (See MEXICO
CITY-8159 and -8228.)
E.
PBRUMEN Maids: The Station decided to
mount an operation against the PERUMEN maids, and
selected LIEMBRACE-3 as a suitable access agent.
(See MEXICO CITY-7861.) The Station is in the
process of turning LIEMBRACE-3 over to LIREALM-1,
who will be the outside Case Officer on this
· operation. (See also MEXICO CITY-8124.)
F. Chief, LIRING:
corr
The Station has corresponded
with Headquarters about a false flag cold approach
against Chief, LIRING. This still is in the ex-
ploratory stages. (See MEXICO CITY-8242.)
.
7. Harassment of LIRING: There were no new Huarache
leaflets put out during this period.
8.
LICOMET Debriefing Center: NEXICO CITY-8066 reported
that the charitable sponsorship covering the overt activities
of the debriefing certer ended on 31 October 1968 and that the
extra financial cover for the office space would end 30 November.
Headquarters' assistance was requested in resolving this
problem. (See also MEXICO.CITY--8179 and -8287.) HMMA-35887
forwarded more detailed LICONET-2 reports on the LICONET cover
problem.

9. QUICON: There were no operations against QUIOON
during this period. QUIOON's activity in Mexico remained
normal.
10.
Double Agents: LISASSY-1 returned from his European
trip on 17 November and was recontacted by LIRING-9, who
levied requirements on him as reported in MEXICO CITY-8339.
LISASSY-1 continues to have difficulty satisfying LIRING-9
requests for information on the activities of the PBRUMEN
community in Mexico City and Hia.i. The CI aspect of the
LISASSY-1 operation was virtually at a standstill for two
reasons: first, at one time or another, either LIRING-9 or
LISASSY-1 was out of Mexico; and second, the Station has been
unable to come up with information which LISASSY-1 could pass
to LIRING-9. In this last respect, LISASSY-1 continues to be
an excellent channel of WOFIRM-controlled information to the
PBRUMEN Government via LIRING-9.

Operations Against PEEUMEN Subversive Activities in
Latin America:

A. LIRING-3: See MEXICO CITY-7900 for RONTON's
initia
C Conditions in
Guatemala. MEXICO CITY-7945. reported that LIRING-3
received a letter from Guatemala which he interpreted
as a check on a new commo channel between the
Guatemalan rebels and him. LIRING-3 reported at
· length to LIRING-9 on his contacts with FAR members
while in jail. At LIRING-3's suggestion, LIRING-9
may send LIRING-3 to PBRUNEN to make a personal
report on this. (See MEXICO CITY-8159.) More
detailed reports were forwarded in HMMA-35905.
HMMA-35904 forwarded a report of LIRING-3's imprison-
ment in Guatemala.
B. Letter Drops: The PBRUMEN letter drops
being covered by the Station only produced one
interesting letter during this period. (See HMMA-
35873.) The Station suggested that Headquarters
follow up on the lead provided.
C. LIRING-7: LIRING-7 continued to see his
Mexican leftist student "friends" during this period.
(See HMA-35823.) He also escorted a high-ranking
member of the Orthodox Church during a visit to
Mexico. One intelligence dissemination was made on
the basis of information produced by LIRING-7 during
this visit.
D. LIHACK-4: When he was in jail in mid-
November, LIHACK-4 was approached by some Mexicans,
arrested in connection with the student disturbances.
He was asked to take a walkie-type radio into jail.
for their commo, and was asked if he would be willing
to assist them with his ham radio equipment for
direct commo between the revolutionaries and PBRUMEN,
since going through LIRING was not satisfactory.
The Station is taking a wait-and-see attitude to see
how this develops. (See NEXICO CITY-8213.)
14
E. Subject of HMMA-35572: Via LIFEAT, LIENTRAP,
and the LIEMBRACES, the Station identified a Nexican
student contact of LIRING. Background information
on this person, including photos, was passed to the
LITEMPOS on 21 November 1965 with a suggestion that
they arrest and interrogate the person.

G. Subject of -35516: The Station is
still planning to have RONTON explore the feasibility
of approaching Subject and using him as an eventual
source in PERUKER, where, by the nature of his
function, he still maintains contacts. (See -
35516.)
H.
AUSTRUT-16: Subject traveled to PIRUMEN
on 18 October 1968 and returned on 1 November. On
her return to Nexico she was debriefed by Henry J.
SLOWAN, who came to Mexico on TDY for this purpose.
The results of this debriefing were received in
UFAA-355.
I. Subject of MEXICO CITY-8319: LITAMIL-3
was contacted by Subject, who returned from PECUMEN
on 2 December. Subject was debriefed by a Station
Case Officer on the current status of the relation-
ship between his organization and the PERTHEN
Government, and on other requirements given him
before his departure for PBRUMEN. The most pronising
factor in this operation is the fact that four of
híc
his subordinates will ho coming out for a conference
in April 1969. Subject promised to give the Station
access to any or all of these individuals.

encountered in trying to have a LIRISK unit installed
in the LIHACK-4 1P. The Station made its own LIRISK
installation on 23 November. (See NEXICO CITT-8182.)
All attempts to activate the KTRAP have so far
been unsuccessful. (Sec MEXICO CITY-8303.)
B. LISANDAY: LISAMPAN coverage of BAKER
continued. EASY was lost on 9 October as a result
of a routine installation in the same building by
the LIRISK company. Attempts to activate EAST from
LISARI were unsuccessful. (See MEXICO CITY-7598 and
-8232.)
C. LIENVOY: LIENVOY coverage has remained
unchanged. The LIRING Commercial line still has
not been reconnected.
D. LIFEAT: LIFEAT coverage of LIRING-21 was
discontinued on 15 November for security reasons.
The coverage was renewed on 6 December.
E. LIONION: LIONION-1 continued to perform
his photographic and audio duties. His ability now
to identify people by name by monitoring DOG is
particularly useful.
F. LIROSIN: LIROSIN-1 was kept on full salary.
during the period. In late November he was given
the assignment of renting a new LP which was spotted
by LITAINT-2. He successfully rented this LP O
4 December, after LIRENO-1 laid the groundwork, and
will move into it on 18 December 1968. This will
be the base for an audio operation against LIRING-2,
LIRING-9, and LIRING-13.

A. AMBCOK-3: AMBOOK-3 is employed by a local
Mexican television station and apparently does not
intend to return to PERUKIN. The Station had no
ops contact with A:BOOK-3 during the period of this
repori. He planned to travel to the United States
to cover the Apollo/8 launching at Cape Kennedy in
·late December 1968, but this was not definite.
B. Travel Control Information: LIFIRE, LICONET,
and LITEXPO continued to provide this type of
information.
:
C. PBRUMEN Fishing Fleet: There was no
activity against this target. Several fishing
boats, however, did seek shelter at Isla Mujeres,
and on each occasion several crew members sought
asylum. The LICOMETS were alerted each time to try
to obtain debriefings of these men. (See MEXICO
CITY-8039.)
U. MHVIPER: The Lîtugis continued to provide
QUMOON cargo manifests, and LIRENO-1 provided crew
and ship manifests. The manifests were pouched to
JMCOBRA and Headquarters for processing. (See HMMA-
35912.)
E. AMDESTINE-1: ANDESTINE-1 was terminated'
per Headquarters direction. See MEXICO. CITY-7661,
DIRECTOR-42579, and MEXICO CITY-7739.
F. ANDAUB-1: On 17 October ANDAUB-1 asked
for assistance from LNPURE. (See MEXICO CITY-7709.)
On 25 October he left Mexico for Miami, where he .
was met and handled by WH/Miami. (See JMCOBRA-1427.)
k
G. LIAMATOL-1: LIAMATOL-1 was met on 17 October
1968 and agreed to cooperate with the Case Officer
by furnishing information on the activities of the
PBRUMENers in the Veracruz area. LIAMATOL-1
requested that his main line of communication with
the Station be through LIRENO-1 for security reasons.
(See HNCIA-35913 and -35917.)
f
H. Subject of MEXICO CITY-7515: The Station
notified Headquarters of the arrival in Mexico of
a person on the list of "40." The Station was asked
to contact this Subject's brother to determine the
present status of Subject. This was done, and the
report submitted in MEXICO CITY-7754 indicated that
he was content with his life in PBRUMEN and was not
interested in contacts, even with his own brother,
if there was to be pressure applied for him to
remain outside PBRUMEN.

During a baseball game between PBRUMEN and
the United States during November, the PBRUMEN
players attacked several spectators. Through
LITAMIL-3 the Station is trying to arrange to have
one of those attacked sue a LIRING employee.

would be wasting his time on this case because orders
from an unidentified high Mexican Government official
indicated that the planned charges against the
. employee would not be accepted for trial. ¡
J. ANSTET-1; AMSTET-1 sent a letter to the
home of AMSTRUT-8, who in turn notified the Station
to come and pick it up. The contents of the letter
were forwarded to Headquarters in NEXICO CITY-8130.
This is a Headquarters case in which the Station
participates only as a letter drop via AMSTRUT-8.
13.
As can be seen, all the above has been previously
reported to Headquarters. In view of this, and the fact that
the PBRUMEN Section, in addition, submits regular quarterly
progress reports on its projects, it is felt that reporting
on the Station's activities against the PBRUMEN target is
(adequate. Therefore, the Station once more suggests that
formal PBRUMEN Section monthly or bimonthly reports be
discontinued. Please advise.

Forwarded attached are the two last contact reports

departure on TDT in late January 1969. These reports are
dated 15 and 22 sauuary. ALSO FOLwarded is another, repoE L
by ROWTON, dated 28 November 1968, which the Station somehow
failed to forward.
2. That LIRING has forwarded information to the Mexican
Communist Party casting suspicion on LIRING-3's past activities
did not come as a great shock. Heraclio ZEPEDA is known to
the Station as a previous teacher at the University of Jalapa
who said in 1960 that he would accept a teaching position in
PBRUMEN, a country he has visited on several occasions at the
invitation of its government. ZEPEDA also spent some time

in 1965 in the U.S.S.R., where he was described as Foreign
Correspondent of La Voz de Mexico, an official organ of the
Mexican Communist Party (see HMMA-27727, 24 November 1965).
ZEPEDA apparently also visited Communist China. He appears
to be well acquainted with LIRING-9. In view of the above,
the Station instructed ROWTON to ask LIRING-3 to refrain from
attempting to use ZEPEDA to obtain a "bootleg" copy of the
LIRING letter to the Mexican Communist Party. The Station
feels a copy of this letter would add little to the known fact
that LIRING-3 is a person that LIRING continues to view as
"suspect." LIONHEART has been asked for up-to-date informa-
tion on ZEPEDA's Party position. Any information passed by
LIONHEART will be forwarded to Headquarters.

because of an affair I had with the Carmen, - you know, the daughter
of the doctor we just said hello to as we came in, the one talking with
LIRING/2.
L/9: "Is that so? I had no ideal"
L/3: "Well I assumed you knew, since Carmen's father is a close friend of
your Chief. In any case, it's over now, and I don't expect any trouble
from that quarter. However, I feel that I should explain that I have
an obligation to my wife for all that she did not me while I was in
jail with no help from anyone, as you well know."

want any part of the activity that a nowalution demande. Shale the on
many others, including my former cell-mate and his famous uncle, who
talk a great revolution, but fall apart when the chips are down."

L/3: "Well, anyway, my wife wouldn't approve of my reinvolvement and keeps
pressing me to take a "respectable" job which she knows I could obtain
through my friends. What I really what to do is to somehow calm her down
and arrange things so that she won't have any idea of my political plans.
As you know her father is very ill in New York, and she is anxious to
see him before he dies. I can arrange an exposition in Montreal and then
ask the father to come up to see us there. That would get around the
problem of a U.S. visa, which I'm sure neither of us could get."

unfortunately there are no boats going from here. They all stop at New
York. Don't you have regular ship traffic to Montreal, so that we could
go that way?”

PERUMEN capital enroute."

Yes, there's really no problem."

LIRING/3 Report of Meeting with LIRING/9.
1. LIRING/3 reported to Rowton at 0915 on 27/11/63 that he had met with
LIRINġ/9 at the LIRING establishment from about 1745 until 1900 on 26/11/63.
He stated that he gave LIKING/9 his written report on his recent experiences
in Guatemala and the conclusions be drew from talking with PAR members there.
L/3 also stated that he did his best to assure L/C that, although he sympathized
with the laments of the León Barrios brothers, he was really on the PBRUMEN
side and offered to do all he could to assist the IKINGs in their attempts to
assist the revolutionary forces. The following is Rowton's reconstruction of
the conversation, based on LIRING/3's report:
L/3: "I'm sorry to be late, but I had to finish the report."
L/9: "Alright. I've been waiting here at the gate so there wouldn't
be any further delay. Let's go to my office so we can talk pri-
catal
Upon entering office, 1/9 removes jacket and offers L/3 a seat in the
office.
L/3: "Well, here's my report. I must apologize that it's in rough draft
form. I had to write it rather burriedly when my wife was not around.
It's really just a series of badly organized thoughts and ideas but
I'll be glad to explain. There's a great deal more, of course, that
I could explain on the subject. Do you wish me to read it?”
L/9: "No, that's alright.
L/9 glances through the report and continues:
"I'll read it carefully later. I really didn't expect such a long
report. I appreciate it. In the meantine, how are you doing in your
personal affairs?

L/3: "Well, as I told you last time, I'm very much up in the air at the
moent. My exposition has started but is not going as well as can be
expected as well as I had hoped. You know, these things have their
up's and down's. I'll sell some things, at least to cover my current
expenses, but I'll really have to get better organizéd financially
in the near future. The first problem that I'm really worried about
is my wife, and I frankly feel that I must appeal to you for help.

L/9: "Of course. Well, what is the problem?”

situations that almost led to a separation.."

LIRING/3 Report of Activities for the Period 7-13 January, 1969.
1. Rowton met with LIRING/3 at the Camino Real Restaurant at 1000 on
10 and 13 January. He reported the following developments in connection
with the accusations made against bin to Harta Barrios de León by
Identity A
(a) On the evening of 8 January, 1969,
-
Identity B
called on him at his home unannounced and made an effort to
smooth over the hard feelings that had arisen between LIRING/3
and her husband. She denied any knowledge of charges made by
for husband at w/s and claimed that she could not believe
them in any case. When L/3 stated that he had definite proof ·
in the form of a letter Identity B insisted on seeing it.
1/3 (who had given the original letter to Roston) stalled pro-
mising to produce the letter on 10 January in the presence of her
husband. L/3 told Rowton that when he attempted to contact Iden B
and her husband by phone on the morning of 10 January, he found
the phone constantly busy and suspects that the receiver was
left purposely off the hook.
1
(b) On the evening of 12 January, 1969, Arturo Serrano of the CPM,
visited 112ING/3 at his home and told him that the Central Com-
mittee of the CPM had discussed his feud with Identity A.
in response to the letter LIRING/3 had sent to it alleging that
Iden A was maligning him unjustly. Serrano continued that the
CC of the CFM had found the letter too vague to make any sense,
but in any case could not take Iden A seriously. Serrano told
1/3 that Iden A and Identity B had been recently formally
expelled from the party for ideological reasons, but still had a
number of friends willing to vouch for them. On the other hand
Serrano stated that the CC of the CFW. had received information
"some time ago" from the LISING office alleging that LIRING/3 had
been acting in a suspicious manner, especially with regard to cer-
tain information he had provided concerning Julián López that
"could not have come from a source other than the police." Serrano
continued that although the CFM had no love for the LIRING office
it nevertheless had to take such a report into consideration and
the burden of proof was really on LIRI»G/3.

WH/1 (Marvin Francis)
17 September 1968 discussion with DRISCOLL |
re LIRING/3 & LIRING/4.
DRISCOLL, KERBE, FRANCIS and Laurence
PIPER (C/WH/2/G).
-
1. LIRING/4 is still very concerned about the im-
prisonment of LIRING/3. LIRING/4 will not travel to Cuba
until she is assured of the safety FIRING /
DRISCOLL
has thorougnly discussed L/3 with L/4 and has pointed out
the danger of attempting to intercede on L/3's behalf.
through business contacts. L/4 contacted the Cubans for
assistance but they stated there was nothing they could do.
They have assisted L/4 with small amounts of money. L/3
has devised an open code which he uses in letters to let
L/4 know how he is. The letters are grim reading because
L/3 keeps stating he is unable to hold out much longer.
Fellow prisoners have warned L/4 not to let the Guats
transfer him to another prison as this usually ends in the
prisoner being shot "while escaping. One good result
from the continued imprisonment of L/3 is that both he and
L/4 are furthering their bona fides with the Cubans. i
"

2. L/4 is in telephone contact with the Third Secre-
tary of the Mexican Embassy in Guatemala. He has made
inquiries about L/3 with the Guats on behalf of Foreign
Minister CARRILLO Flores. A few weeks ago (prior to the
assasination of the U.S. Ambassador) the Third Secretary
told L/4 there were three possibilities, the first which
he considered out of the question was that L/3 would be
shot, the second was that L/4 would come to trial and be
released within a few weeks, and the third was that he would
receive a sentence of two or three years. Just prior to
departing Mexico on this current trip, DRISCOLL attempted
to arrange a meet with L/4 in the usual means by slipping a
typed note under her apartment door. She did not make the
meeting. DRISCOLL later learned through phone tap material
that she called the Cuban Embassy and informed them the

"The exposition is not going as well as I expected. But the problem
I'm really concerned about is that of my wife.”
L/9:
"Let her go to FBRUMEN.

"what do you mean? I don't understand.”
L/9:
"Well, I mean with you, when you 50.”
L/3: "Ch, yes,
"Ch, yes, I see. Of course. She can see her relatives and there won't
be a problem. You know my wife was getting pretty desperate about seeing
XXXXXXKKERIKÆXXX@XXXXXXXXX her father and she even talked of going to the
Northamerican Ambassy for a visa so that she could go to New York. Imagine
that! I told it would be no use - just a waste of time since she woiulnd
get the visa."
I/O: "For heaven's sake, tell her not to go! That would create no end of
rogations in the FBKRUMEN capital. Calm her downaby all means.
"Getting back to my report, as I said, many points can be expanded."
"Yes. Let's zeet again on,say, Monday, at a time convenient for you."
"You know I have plenty of time now. I'm up in the air, as I said, not
doing much just the exposition. On the other hand you'na busy man.
You set the time."

" Yes. I'll be back."
"I'm gald you covered the important point as to what the FAR thinks of
us. This is very important to us. Also you say that you expect a contact
with one of them here?"
"Yes, with a certain 'Pavel' but I don't know when. I am in contact as you
can see. They have been writing me more or less regularly since my de-
parture." (L/3 takes two letters from pocket and shows them, but L/9
makes no move to take them or read contents.)
"Well, I'll be waiting for you at 1000 on Monday."
2. LIRING/3 told Roston at a subsequent meeting (1100,28/11/680) that when
he returned home the previous evening, he found to his surprise a note slipped
under the door from HIHING/9 asking him not to forget to come by at 1000 on
Monday, 2 December, 1968.

2.
Serrano, as a friend, advised L/3 to "take the bull by the
horns" and send as much data as possible to defend himself
to all "important progressive" organizations. He volunteered
to pass a copy of the letter from Marta Barrios to the CFM and
L/3's version of the arrest and detention as soon as he had pre-
pared it.
、2. In response to Rowton's query as to any other friends L/3 might have
in the CPM who might be able to obtain a copy of the original letter from
the LIRING Office, LIRING/3 recalled that an old acquaintance from Chiapas,
Romelic Ropoda, bud Indembly invived cam to dinner and appeared anxious to
re-establish contact with him. I/3 told Rowton that he had known Zepeda
in the PERUMEN capital some six years previously and recalled that Zepeda
-
had traveled and studied in Communist China and the Soviet Union before re-
turing to Mexico. Zepeda recently told L/3 that he was employed in CCNASUPO
and that he had written several articles favorable to L/3 in "Renovación"
a daily newspaper he controlled in Tuxla-Gutierrez, Chiapas. L/3 told Roston
that he later learned that the newspaper was actually owned by Hank González,
general director of CONASUPO, who apparently had political ambitions.
3. Horton suested that L/3 get in touch with Zepeda not only to determine
why he had recontacted 1/3 after so long a time, but to ascertain his current
relationship with the CPH and the LIRING office, if any.
4. LIRING/3 stated that he had not been recontacted by "Rómulo" and promised
to advise Rowton in advance of a future meeting so that Rowton could cover
it in the hope of getting a good look at the FAR representative.

1. At 1000 on 21/1/69 LIRING/3 told Rowton that his old Guatemalan
friend Jacobo Rodríguez Padills was residing at Calle Veracruz 14.
apartment, and that the Carlos Vega,whom Jacobo had sent to LIRING/3's
home with a note asking 1/3 to help Vega, was living in the azotea
(servant's) room belonging to Jacobo's apartment.
2. L/3 also reported that Carlos Vega again called on him unangounced
at his apartment on 20 January.and asked him to arrange through his
PBRUMEN friends to send a package of medicine to a son of Turcios
who was living in the PERUMEN capital. Vega also asked 1/3 to send
two "very important" letters to PERUMEN through friends who could
bypass the usual censorship. L/3 promised to do what he could and asked
Vega to deliver the letters tohim on 25 January.
i
3. Because of the obvious possibility of provocation in this rather
unexplained behavior of Carlos Vega ( he originally told L/3 that be
was a close friend of Identity A ), Rowton agreed with I/3 that
no attempt should be made to open the letters and that they should
be delivered promptly to the LIKING office for whatever disposition
that establishment might what to make of the letters. L/3 promised
to note carefully the addressees of the letters.
4. Rowton told L/3 that he would have to leave town for a visit to
Monterrey and was not certain when he would be able to finish his
business there. He made at date, however, for 1000, 3 February,at
the Camino Real restaurant, and asked L/3 to return to the gaze place
at 1000 on 7 February in the event that Rowton did not appear at the
first time and date.

Mexican authorities had notified her she was being finėd
500 pesos. The purpose of the payment was not identified.
Later she made a call from the Cuban Embassy which indicated
she was staying there until she could get the funds to pay
the Mexicans. DRISCOLL. therefore, concluded she had not
returned to her apartment and did not get the note to make
their meeting. DRISCOLL said SUAREZ (the visiting Cuba
Cultural type) has a key to L/3's apartment and might see
the note but would be unable to identify the sender since
DRISCOLL uses a meaningless scited as a signature.
3. DRISCOLL now plans upon his return to Mexico to
recontact L/4 to get the latest reading on 1/2 tits in
Guatemala. 11 the Mexican Charge is unable to obtain L/3's
release in behalf of the Nexicans and if it appears he will
be held indefinately, DRISCOLL wants to explore the possibility
of our doing something to get L/3 out so the operation can
become active again.
4.
In the above regard L/3 was discussed with Mr. PIPER
of the Guatemala desk. Mr. PIPER believed the Station has
a high enough contact with the Guats (ESMAJOR/20-Presidents
brother) to arrange to get L/3 and his Mexican compatriot out
of prison and back to Mexico with a minimun security risk.
DRISCOLL said he would initiate the cable upon his return to
Mexico after he has talked with L/4. DRISCOLL felt he should
possibly travel to Guatemala and have a preliminary meet with
L/3 before Guat Station makes any all out effort to officially
request L/3's release. If, after seeing L/3 DRISCOLL is satis-
fied that L/3 is still an ally and is willing to cooperate
after his release then DRISCOLL believes we should attempt to
have the Station intercede with ESMAJOR/20. Hopefully, ESMAJOR/
20 will arrange the release so that all involved believe it
has been done at the request and urging of the Mexican Govern-
ment. DRISCOLL, however, would like L/3 and L/4 to believe
he (DRISCOLL) had something to do with the release in order
to raise his status with both for the sake of future operation-
al tasks he will levy on them.

LIRING/3 told Howton that there had been little or no developments
since he last saw Howton (21/1/69),just before Rowton had left on
his business trip to Monterrey. He commented that he had felt it
wiser not to take any initiative in seeking out his FAR friends or
revisiting the LIRING office until Histon had returned. Ge stated
that his old Guatemalan friend, Jacobo Rodriguez Padilla,had called
on him once in the company of Carlos Vega, but nothing significant
had emerged from the casual conversation. Vega, at several points
in the conversation, had mumbled something to Rodriguez about the
"crisis" but nieber gave an explanation. L/3 told howton that he as-
sumed that this remark referrred to the current factionalism in the
Guatemalan revolutionary struggle.
LIRING/3 then identified the attached photo of Mario Augusto Mendez
Aguilar immediately at the first glance as that of "Rómulo", aka "Mario
Mendez" and "Pavel." LIRING/3 did not recognize the photo Rowton
showed him of Mario Otoniel Mendez Holina.
5. Guidance/Information Given to Agent:
Rowton told L/3 that according to the very sketchy information he
had concerning Mario Augosto Mendez Aquilar it appeared that the latter
belogged to a strongly anti-PBRUMEK faction and that this would perhaps
explain the turn-about of the LIRINGs after he, L/3, hạd indicated to
LIRING/9 that he was in contact with "Pavel."
Rowton urged L/3 to seek out "Rómulo" at the calle Coahuila 221 safe-
house, and, failing this, to recontact Humberto González Vega at his
home on calle Manzanillo, in the hope that the latter could arrange
a recontact with Mendez.

"Romulo," who made at least one trip "out
of town" from 17 February to 2 April 1969 (possibly
to Guatemala) during the period covered by ROWTON's
reports, appears to belong to a faction of the
Guatemalan FAR family disillusioned with PBRUMEN.
C. The only real service asked LIRING-3 by
"Romulo" during the period under review was to put
up an unidentified "comrade" scheduled to come to
Nexico at a date which "Romulo" said he could not
determine exactly. This "comrade" was not the young
Guatemalan who dropped in on' LIRING-3 for a couple
of days mentioned in the report dated 25 April.
d.
LIRING-3 continues to collect clear evidence
that LIRING has done its best to denounce him as a
suspicious element definitely not to be trusted (see
reports dated 15 and 19 February).
3. Several attempts to tail "Romulo" did not produce
particularly significant results. A pretext investigation of
apartment 102 of Calle Coahuila, where LIRING-3 met "Romulo","
produced the results contained in the Spanish language report
dated 26 February forwarded as attachment #2. There were no
traces on the Ines*BASTON deX*PIMENTEL family. Sex:F

There is little question at this point that LIRING-3
is close to persona non grata with LIRING. Hence, his further
usefulness against the PBRUMEN target is very limited.
ROWTON has kept away from LIEING-4 since LIRING-3's release
from prison in Guatemala. Although LIRING-4, following her
father's death (see MEXICO CITY-0125), may visit her mother
in PBRUMEN, she has no particular love for LIRING or the PERUMEN
authorities. On the Guatemalan side of this operation, the
Station is, as it has done many times in the past, waiting for
LIRING-3's Guatemalan contacts to make the next move.

sort of slander since the LIBING office was always
trying to neutralize persons end groups not acting
under their control. He added that the people who really
count in the struggle were used to such nonsense and
were aware of what the LIRINGS were up to. He added that
as soon as Sandoval got out of prison he would "straighten
some of those people out" since he was personally aware
of L/3's motives and activities before his trip to the
border. When L/3 mentioned his contacts with Carlos Vega
(always at the latter's initiative), Rómulo described him
as "Pastelito, a very sectarian sneaky pro-LIRING bastard".
He said he would like L/3 to arrange a meeting with Vega
so that he could burst in and confront him with the facts.
Regarding Humberto González Vega, Rómulo said that be was
a good "elemento" and had suffered a great deal for the
cause, but at the moment was more or less out of the pic-
ture. He say no need for L/3 to be in contact, with him.
When L/3 expressed a desire to have some way of contacting
Rómulo, the latter promised to give him his home address
as soon as he move to a better place. He explained that
at the moment he was living in a furnished room.

At the end of the talk, when Rómulo asked when they could
get together again, explaining that he might have to go
down to Crizaba over the week-end, L/3 'told Rowton that he
made a date for 1900 or 14/2/69. 1/3 then suggested that
they meet outside so as not to involve his wife (1/3 told
Howton that he did this so that Rowton would have a chance
to observe ñózulo in some public place), and Rómulo agreed
but said he had a better suggestion. He then stated that
he knew a Mexican family very well and could arrange that
they meet at their home and have dinner. He added that be
might bring along a Brother ("hermano") and would come by
1/3's home at 1900 to pick him up. L/3 agreed, saying that
he had no objection to the brother coming along.

4. ADMINISTRATIVE: LIRING/3 told Roston that his friend, Berta Wigisser
has rented a furnished apartment that can be used by
him and Howton as a safehouse as soon as it is vacated
by its present occupants. 1/3 explained that these cc-
cupants are relatives of sra Wigisser who are visiviag
from Argentina but who are expected to return to their

AUM ecunt.
5. REPORTS/INFORMATION GIVEN BY AGENT:
L/3 told Reston that "Rómulo" (whom he identified from
a photo as Mario Augosto Mendez Aguilar) visited him at
his home unxannounced at about 2000 on 11 February and
stayed until almost midnight.
According to 1/3 Rómulo apologized for not having seen
L/3 for so long ( last date reported was 3/1/69) ex-
plaining that he was very busy. He then stated that he
had recently seen and talked with Rodolfo Sandoval Al-
egría in the(Lucumberri)prison and was pleasantly sur-
prised to learn that Sandoval knew 1/3 and spoke very
highly of him. Rómulo then went on to say that he had
known Sandoval many years and had actually been his de-
puty in Guatemala. Rómulo recalled that when he was last
arrested (be explained parenthetically that he had been
arrested four times in all) he was urtured in an effort
to make him reveal the whereabouts of Sandoval. He claimed
to L/3 that he finally, to avoid execution, gave a false
address- that of one of Sandoval's relatives.
L/3 told Foston that he then took the occasion to tell
Rómulo of the harrassment he was being subjected to by
various persons whom he felt were being inspired by the
Chief LIRING. 1/3 told Rowten that Romulo then asked him
what the false charges brought against him were. 1/3 told
Rómulo the truth, saying that he kept setting reports that
he was refarded as a LOFIHM agent. Recording to 1/3.26-
mulo exclaimed that he should pay no attention to that

past friendship, Fenny Ravel treated his in an obvious cold manner.
L/3, feeling that he could not this pass unnoticed, got Fanny in the
corner and asked what was up. The replied that for some time she had
been hearing "disturbing reports" about L/3. Under further questioning
by 1/3 she specificl thatoriginally, some 7-8 months previously she
had been told by a LIZING official that 1/3 "was not to be trusted=.
Fanny continued that she did not pay too much attention to this, since
the official was rather "low-level", but more recently she was told the
same thing by an "unimpeachable source" and could not challenge it des-
pite her high personal esteem for L/3.
1/3 commented to Rewton that the "inimpeachable source", must, be the Chief
LIRING, inasmuch as Fanny Ravel as always been a close personal friend
of his and possibly even one of his mistresses. 1/3 continued that
had several wizes commented to him (when L/4 was working in the LIRING
office) that Panny Ravel was infrequent telephone contact with the Chief.
5. GUIDANCE Given to Agent:
Rowton told L/3 that be was more convinced than ever that the LIRING
office had mounted a slander operation against him because of his con-
tacts with the Camille Sanchez group (Leén Barrics brothers and Romulo)
which PERUMEN was apparently attempting to isciate in their own interest.
Shen 1/3 appeared a little consoled at this, Rowton continued that he
felt L/3 should, at the 18 Feb zeeting with "Rómulo", fell the latter that
he knew the gaze the LIKINGs were up to and ask "Rómulo" Foint blank
whether he knew to what extent the LIRING office was trying to sabotage
FAR because of its nationalistic anti-FERUMEN position! Roston asked 1/3
to entice "Rózulo" into such a discussion in the hope that "Rómulo”
would ask him, 1/3, to help discover any unilateral operations PBRUMEN
might be planning. Reaton continued that L/3 should tell Homulo that
although he was virtually cut off from the LIRING office, he still had
a great many FERUMEN friends ( 2.6.
( ) from
whom he could possibly get useful information to help Romulo's faction.
Roston suigested that L/3 could also propose to Romulo 'that they both
put the squeeze on Carlos Vega (apparently a LIKING provocation) to ob-
some preliminary information on the intentions of the HEIG operation.

Forwarded herewith for Headquarters information and
files is an Agent Service Record on LIRING-3.
2. As Addressees are aware. Wallace P. ROWTON recruited
and formerly handled LIRING-3 for the Mexico City Station.
Prior to ROTON's PCS departure from Mexico City in July 1969,
it was deciced, after some discussion, to effect a turnover of
LIRING-3, rather than terminate him. Although LIRING-3 apparently
☐ had been well "burned" with the Cubans, he seemed to have maintained
good contacts with members of the Rebel Armed Forces (FAR) of
Guatemala. In addition, in May and June of this year, he had
begun to develop access to some Panamanian revolutionaries of
interest. It was therefore decided to rur LIRING-3 on a trial
basis to determine whether he could be used effectively against
Central American revolutionary targets, despite his problems with
the Cubans.

3. ROWTON introduced Leonard S. TORMET, in alias, to LIRING-3
on 1 July 1969. Although ROWTON had represented himself to LIRING-3
as a Greek businessman, it was decided that it would be preferable
to "clear the air" somewhat with LIRING-3, at least by making it

4. Reports/Information Given by Agent:
°
LIRING/3 reported that "Rómulo" appeared unannounced at his apartment
on the late afternoon of 17/2/59 and consequently he did not go to meet
him at apartment 102 of 200 Coahuila St. on 18/2/69 as criginally planned.
LIRING/3 told Howton that "Rómulo" prozised to see him again about 1900
on 20/2/69, coming to pick him up at his apartment.
LIRING/3 then stated that on the momine of 47/2/60 no had wn into im
Godoy, the wife of Jorge, at Gobernación and was so disturbed at the cool
reception that he looked up Jorge Godoy later that day to find out what was
going on. Jorge Godoy was quite frank with him telling him that the LI-I`G
office had advised him to keep clear of LIRING/3 because he was not to be
trusted. Godoy continued that a LIKING official had told him that LIRING/3
was being used ( perhaps unconsciously at first) by some counter-revolu-
tionery organization and that the LIRING Office based it assertion on the
following three points: (1) LIAING/3 had been in touch with a foreignor who
pretended to be a businessman but who did not do any business with FERQI,
(2) LIRING/3 had access to information that could come only from a police
source (3) LIRING/3 was responsible for the arrest of Identity A and
had undertaken the mission to Guatemala to get information against the re-
volution.
According to LIRING/3, Horge Godoy told him that it was difficult to belive
all this, especially in the light of I/3's relatively long imprisonment, but
he had to take it seriously in view of the source of the charges. 1/3 xxx
told Rowton that he went over each point in rebuttal on a matter of principle
despite the fact that Godor's mind obviously was already azde up.
IIÄING/3 told Roston that when he talked later that day with "Rómulo" he re-
lated what had happened with Godoy. "Romulo" replied that those LIRING al-
legations were not to be taken seriously. He commented: "he have already
looked into them and do not believe them." He explained that for one thing
if L/3 had beer a spy he certainly would have continued (with the approval
and connivance of the authorities) on up the the mountains where he could get.

stepping across the border. "Rósulo" aggreed with 1/3 that the LIRING office

LIKING, 3 reported that he met again with "Rózulo" but under circum-
stances some hat different from that anticipated. L/3 related that
when he arrived at his apartment about 1850 the previous eveningin
the company of his wife (after having dropped off his daughter at
the bomb of HSCT) be found a note irca "Romulo" asking his to
meet him at apartment 102 of Calle Coahuila 200.
[
L/3 continued that since his wife was present when he read the note
he felt he had to ask her to come along ( and in addition she had been
upɛet that afternoon and did not want to be left alone ). They therefore
both proceeded to the address given by Rmulo and found his there in
the midst of a rather large number of persons, apparently of the same
fazily residing in the apartment. After about fifteen minutes of social
chatter, Rózulo suggested that they go to a nearby restaurant to talk
more privately. Romulo then took L/3 and his wife to the restaurant
Kuku at Calle Coahuila 223 where they had dinner. 1/3 told norton that
because of his wife's presence he was not able to discuss anything sub-
stantive with Romulo and had to leave the questions he wanted to ask him
re PAR/BBRUMEN activites until a subsequent meeting. L/3 added that in
the course of conversation, Romulo stated that Rodolfo Sandoval Alegría
hoped to be released from prison in March, 1969. Rozulo also stated that
he worked in a newspaper office, but 1/3 felt he could not securely ask
the name of the newspaper at that time.
L/3 told Roxton that Romulo agreed to another meeting on 18 February and
asked L/3 to net him again at apartment 102 of Coahuila 200 sportly after
1900, inasmuch as he generally leaves his place of employment a little
before that time. ñomulo,L/3 and his wife then took in a movie.
ˆi/3 then told nowton that after he had left Rowton the previous day he had
another very disturbing experience (he appeared to Rowton nervous and suf-
fering from lack of sleep). L/3 explained that when he dropped into the
Salón de la Plástica Mexicana about 1300 on 14/2/69, he ran into an old
friend, Fanný Ravel, a Nexican artist with whom he had worked very closely
in PERUMEN some years ago. L/S continued to Royton that despite their

probably does not want L/3 to help his ("Rómulošs") faction and have done
everything possible to isolate I1/3 from his normal social contacts. Rérulo
added that the only important point in the whole affair was that there were
"certain elements" among the Guatemalen revolutionaries that might believe the
LIEING charges and possibly do harm to L/3 and or his wife. Rózulo urged 1/3
"to be careful and for that reasca di not encourage the idea of a confronta-
tion with Carlos Vega at this time. He continued that if, however, 1/3 insisted
he would be glad to have it out with Carlos Vega to find out who had sent him
to provoke L/3. Rowton agreed that little or nothing could be accomplished
in pursuing this matter.
L/3 continued that when he told Rómulo that he felt frustrated and helpless
in the fate of the LINING, ómas told him that in
volutionary, have courage and patience in confronting these problems. He con-
tinued that he himself noped to continue to see L/3 and be was sure that things
would work out. He stressed that he and his factic value the friendship and
loyalty of individuals such as 1/3 whereas the LIRING establishment is interested
only in groups and organizations that can further their own interests.
5. GUIDANCE/INFORAMPION given to agent:
Rowton encouraged 1/3 to continue his efforts to find steady employment since
he was most vulnerable to both the LIRING egents as well as FAR in the matter
of his financial resources. L/3 told Rowton that he had already been, pronized
an appointment to some teaching position by Xavier Espinosa, private secretary
to Yañez, the Secretary of Education. L/3 commented that Espinosa is at heart
a "good progressive" and has been very sympathetic to him since his retura to
Mexico. L/3 also stated that he intends to lock up Heracleo Zepeda in the hope
that the latter can place him somewhere in CCHASUPO or arrange a job with his
Chiapas newspaper ( "Renovación").
Howton also urged 1/3. to continue to elicit information fros "Rómulo" coaser-
ning his faction of the FAR and any knowledge he might have concerning the
independent operations being planned by FERCHEN in Guatemala.

several years previously in FBRUNCH. He then stated that in any case the
PBRUMEN Chief would not be retuming to Mexico, and that this should make 1/3
happy. To console L/3, Iden B continued that the LIRING Chief was not popular
with the staff, since he was considered to formal and snobbish, and sozeviat
petty in his vindictiveness. Iden B agreed with 1/3 that the LIRING Chief had
done much to harm LIMING/3's reputation, and probably acted from purely personal
motives ( under the influence of Carmen Lozada's father and husband).
Iden B did not tell 1/3 who would replace the LIRING Chief. He commented that
for some time back he had withdrawn from politeis and tried to zind his ovr
business, earning his living by giving lectures on his own initiative.
On the domestic situation in PERMEN, Iden B commented that things were very
bad" both politically and economically. He explained that FERUMEN currently found
itself in a squeeze play between the big powers and was genuinely fearful of
a Soviet/Nixon rapprochement, at their expense, of course. On the economic side
Iden B commented that he was happy to be in Mexico but added weekly that there
was every hope that things would get better by 1970. When L/3 countered that
everyone had been singing that tune for many years, Iden B did not defend his
position.
LIKING/3 then told Routon that he took the occasion to mention to Iden B that
a certain Carlos Vega ( akaCarlos Enrique LOPEZ Garcia) had been pestering hiş
in the hope of finding someone traveling to PERUMEN who would be willing to
carry some packages to some of his friends (including the son of Turcios). shep
L/3 asked Iden B whether he would be willing to meet this Carlos Vega before
consenting to carry over his packages, Iden B replied; "Sí,como no. Con mucho
gusto."
LIRING/3 commented to Reston that he brought up the name of Carlos VEGa as a
sign of good faith both vis-a-vis the latter as well as the LNG office since
he felt it highly probably that Vega was reporting regularly to the LIRING comple
either directly or indirectly and that in fact Vega had possibly been sent to
check on LIRING/3 and his wife. LIRING/3 continued that he planned to reson-
tact Jacobo Rodríguez Padilla and ask him to pass along the message to Carlos
Vega that LIRING/3 was anxious to see him again since he felt that he had re-
solved Vega's "problem."
LIRING/3 also told Rowton that he had expressed the desire to Įdėn B to re-
visit PBRÜMEN some time in the future. Iden B replied that he would do every-
thing he could to expedite the visa, which he said he felt present no problem.
LIRING/3 also told Rowton that LIRING/4 had received a letter from her mother
asking her to attempt to obtain a 30-day visitor's visa for her to come to
Mexico on vacation. LINING/3 told Rowton that he and DIRING/4 had already

made formal application for the visa, although they were not optimistic that
Gobernación would grant it. LIKING/3 added that he did not mention this deve-
lopment to Iden B
, although he might possibly mention it in passing
at his next chat. LIRING/3 commented to Roston that he felt LIRING/4's mother
might have some interesting Fossip but could not be expected to tell him and
LIRING/4 anything startling. He added that he had applied for the visa more out
of courtesy that in earnest and actually hoped that the visa would not be
granted, since this would give him and LIRING/4 a good pretext to make another
trip to FERUMEN for purely personal reasons.

4. Information/ Reports Given by Agent:
LIRING/3 reported that he received an unexpected visit on 9/4/69
from Rogelio Aguirre, brother of Jerjes Aguirre, whom both he and
LIRING/4 have known for many years (from their work together in
PERUMEN). LIRING/3 told Rowton that he was surprised at the visit
Since both Augelio and verges aguirre were close iriends of Teresa
Lozada and her husband, Carlos Fersabal. 1/3 explained to Rowton
that both Rogelio and Jerjes are employed in the Secretaría de
Education where Teresa Lozada worked for several years.
LIRING/3 continued to Rowton that Rogelio, without making any
reference to the Persabal family, asked LIRING/3 to do him an
important favor. He went on to state that, as LIRING/3 knew,
Identity C
was currently living in her home
town in FBRUMEN( the same area that LIBING/4 comes from) and was
Hoping to visit them in Mexico City in the near future. Rogelio
continued that he hoped that LIRING/3 could have a check from a
Canadian bank and immigration documents hand-carried to Iden C
so that she could pay for the ticket and present the Mexican
visa locally in PERUMEN. LIRING/3 told Reston that although he felt
a bit mystified at this request, he told Rogelio Aguirre that be
would do what he could to find someone who was planning a trip to
PBRUMEN in the near future.
LIRING/3 continued to Rowton that the name of his friend} Iden B
immediately came to his mind,and be attempted to telephone
him at the apartment of LIRING/9. He, however, found that the tele-
phone was not in service, and felt that he had an excellent pretext
to visit the apartment about 1500 on that same day ( 11/4/69) ex-
plaining to Iden B
(and/or LIRING/2 or /9) that he had to get
in touch urgently to pass on the request of Rogelio Aguirre. LIRING/3
agreed with Howton that he could take this occasion to ask the LIRING
office to attempt to obtain information on the state of health of the

to recontect LIRING/9 and tell him about RING/4's application for the
visa. Rowton agreed that this would be the best course of action, especi-
ally since LIRING/3 had originally mentioned LIRING/4's desire to visit
her sick father and the problem this represented for him, when he first
talked to LIRING/9 after his return from Guatemala.
LIKING/3 t-ld Rowton that he felt this would also constitute a good pre-
text to sound out LIRING/9 about his personal feelings toward LIRING/3
and his own situation in the LIRING Office. Rowton suggested that LIRING/3
take this occasion to mention casually that he was still in occasional
contact with the Guatemalans and to give LIRING/9 the names of "Rómulo“
and Carlos Vega, if L/9 asked for details.

father of LIRI:G/4 through the LIRING office in New York City. IIKING/3
agreed that there was little chance of this request being honored, but
it would serve to reveal his lack of any other channels to LIRING/4 's
father and stress the legitimacy of HIRING/4's concern for the health
of her father( an application for a visa to visit him).
LIRING/3 then stated to Rowton that he suspected the telephone of the
LIRING/9 apartment was tapped. He explained that generally when he had
called in the past, there was an unexplained interruption in the line
before the party could reply. He stressed to howton that this was his

recently as 9/4/69 did not make any comment about the telephone service

LIKING/3 promised Rowton that when he visited the apartment: that afternnon
he would take as good a note as possible of the lay-out and furnishings
and ascertain the identity of the maid.

LIRING/3 reported that at long last "Rómulo"( Fario Augcsto Mendez
Aguilar) had reappeared at his apartment, on the afternoon of 2 April,
without prior notice, as usual. HIRING/3 told Rowton that "Rómulo"
apologize for not having been able to revisit LIRING/3 before that
date, and explained that he had been "out of town". According to 1/3
“nómulo" ala not give any explanation of his absence since mid-February
and L/3 felt he could not ask for such explanation. "Rómulo" promised
to keep in touch with LIHING/3 by dropping in to his apartment "whenever
he could". LIKING/3 told Rowton that he made a discreet effort to ret
from "Rózulo" a telephone number or address through which he could be
contacted.

LIRING/3 also reported that he had met with Iden B

tuat Iden B 'would not take the initiative of recontacting LIRING/3
without prior consultation with HIRING/9 and LIRING/2.
LIRING/3 then told Rowton that LIMING/4 had received a very pessimistic
letter from a certain Echemendia, e uncle residing in Brooklyn, New York,
who stated that LIRING/4's father was dring of cancer of the throat and
was unable to leave his home. LIRING/3 continued that he had just dis-
covered that LIRING/4 on her own initiative had rushed to the U.S. Con-
sulate and requested a visa. As she subsequently told LIRING/3, LIRING/4
was informed by a consular official that her case would have to be "in-
vestigated carefully by CFACT" and that she was required to pay 125 pesos
for a telegram to Washington, D.C. to expedite the case. LIRING/3 told
Rowton that he felt LIRING/4's action had been precipitous and could cause
bim additional embarrassment with the LIRING office.. He added that he did
not think a visa would be granted, but asked kowton to do whatever he
could to make certain that LINING/4's request was turned down. He con-
tinued that in view of this unexpected development, he felt it wise

4. Information/Reports Given by Agent:
LURING/3 reported that unfortunately "Rezulo" (Maric Augosto MENDEZ Aguilar)
had not reappeared since his last meeting with him ( 17/2/63) and that be
felt he could do nothing but wait for him to initiate the recontact.
T.TRING/3 Continued that on his own initiative he had dropped by the IIEING
offices on 21 March, feeling that he should not continue to remain in iso-
lation despite the unfavorable rumors against him apparently originated by
that office. He told Rowton that unfortunately he did not find anyone of
importance in the offices at that time, but was told by the gatekeeper that
"they wanted to see hin" and that he should return early the following week.
LIRING/3 continued to Rowton that instead of returning to the office he de-
cided to telephone LINING/9 at his home. He did so on the morning of 25/3/69
but was told by a woman with a Mexican accent (obviously the maid) that neither
LIRING/9 nor HIRING/2 was at bome. LIRING/3 then left his name and asked the
woman to inform either of them that he had called.
LIRING/3 continued that about 1200 that same day ( 25/3/69) his old friend
* Identity B appeared unannounced at his appartient. L/3 told Rowton that
although it was obvious that Iden B had appeared in response to the tele-
phone message that L/3 had left for LIRING/9, Iden B did not refer to it,
explaining simply that he had dropped around to see how LIRING/3 and his wife
were doing. He did mentioned subsequently in the conversation that be was
now living with LIRING/2 and LIRING/9 and LIRING/13 in their "very ample"
apartment. Iden B continued that he hoped to remain in Mexico until July
1969 and that he was pleuning to marry a Mexican divorcée with three children
(boys) whom he had originally met many years ago in a visit to Mexico City.
WIRING/3 told Rowton that Iden B was surprisingly cordial, regretting the
fact that ther had not seen each other for some time and encouraging LINING/3
to keep in touch in the future. He invited I/3 to lunch on 29/3/69 but asked
him to telephone to confirm. He rave L/3 the telephone number of HIRING/9's
residence, apparently forgetting that L/3 already had the number.

about him, since he himself had been subjected to auch the same treatment

LIRING/3 apologized for not having been able to make the last
scheduled meeting with Rowton, 1000 on 18/4/69. He explained that
his friend, Iden B
had unexpectedly dropped in to see him
at that time and he felt it more important to see him again than to
make the meeting with Rowton ( he subsequently left = Paccaro with
nowcon's answering service).
LIRING/3 continued that be explained to
Iden B
the emotional
strain that LIRING/4 was undergoing as a result of the bad news con-
cerning her father's health. He then asked Iden B to attempt to as-
certain the true state of his health through the LIRING Office in New
York and gave Iden B the name and telephone number of the aunt of
LIRING/4 who appeared to be the best source. Iden B
according
to LIRING/3 promised to send a message with the next pauch and hoped
to have news for LIRING/3 within the next ten days.
According tō LIRING/3, Iden B
then suggested that LIRI.G/3
think about moving to PERCHEN for a "lengthy stay, perhaps indefinitely."
He explained that he felt he understood LIRING/3's problems, the lus-
nies, the subtle persecution and the resultant increasingly difficult
financial situation he found himself in, and he felt there was no real
solution in Mexico. In FEROMEN, however, he could manage much more easily
for his wife and child, since most of his basic finachial problems would
be solved. He added that he was sure that he could find LIRING/3 some
sort of work in the cultural field as soon as he returned to FERCHEN and
then arrange an invitation. LIRING/3 told Roxton that although he regarded
this proposition as encouraging (since he was certain that Iden B
had prior approval from the LINING Office), he took a natural and logical
approach in replying to Iden B Se stated that he told Iden B that in
principle he agreed but he had to face the relities of the situation. First
he was not at all certain that he could convince his wife to make such a
move, and second, he was not optimistic that Iden B could arrange a good
position for bim in PBRUMS that would permit him to work seriously and
of course, make enough money to meet his living expenses. Iden B

on the morning of 22/4/69 alone, since

City. LIEING/3, however, was able to talk to the Director of the
Art Gallery of

himself and arred an ex-
position for 7 June, 1959.
LIKING/3 continued to Rowton that when he returned home late that
sable right he found a rcte from his wife informing him that she
had gone out to telephone long distance and would not be back until
late that night. When she returned she informed him that she had re-
ceived a telegram informing her that her father had died at 2030 cz
the previous evening ( 21/4/69) and that she had been attempting to
telephone her mother in FBRUMEN but had not been able to get through.
LIRING/3 continued that his father-in-law was buried on 24/4/69 and
that his wife was still in a state of depression and grief, especially
since she had been unable to see her father before his death or at-
tend the funeral.
LIRING/3 also reported that at about 1030 on 23/4/59 a Guatezalan,=ged
about 25,poorly dressed and somewhat resembling Carlos Vega, had ap-
peared unannounced at his apartment with a small piece of paper on
which were written LIEING/3's name and address. He introduced himself
without care simply as a "friend of the León Earrios brothers from
Guatemala City," end asked LIRING/3 to put him up for a few days.
LIRING/3 told Howton that he agreed after some reluctance, suspecting
that this was the person referred to by Mario Mendez (Répulo"), al -
though the young Guatemalan did not mention "Réaulo" by Hame. IIRITG/2
told Rowton that before promising to put the Cuatemalan up, he co-
mented to him that altiough he had a great deal of personal respect for
the León Barrios brothers he was disappointed that neither they nor
their mother had written to him for the past several months, apparently

replied that he felt it quise possible to arrange something for LIRING/3
and for that reason hai brought the idea at this point!
!
Rowson told LIRING/3, in reply to his query. that such a trip to PBRUKED
would be interesting to him only if LINING/3 was offered a position in
the cultural field with good access to intellectuals and govern-
ment officials. LIRING/3 arreed, commenting that he knew Iden D
and such young rebelswell enough to develop good contact with them, provided
he was given a reasonably serious job. In any case he promised to work cz
LIRING/4 in the hope of persuading her to re along with hip, when and is
Iden B's
proposal materialized.

LIRING/3 continued that Iden B
then offered to arrange en exposition
for LIRING/3 at
in Cuernavaca, stating that he could
do so without difficulty through the virector of the galleries (female) vio
was a close friend of his. LIRING/3 accepted this apparently genuine offer
and arranged to travel to Cuernavaca on the morning of 22/4/69 to talk the
matter over with the director of the art galleries.
MIRING/3 then reported to Roston that "Rézulo" had agair visited him at his
apartment late on the evening of 18/4/69 (thus anticipating the meeting
for 1830 in front of woolworth's for the following day, as originally planned).
According to LIRING/3, "Rózulo" ( Kario Augosto Mendez Aguilar) told him that
he had taken the liberty of coming that evening to IIFING/3's apartment since
he wanted to talk in private of "something that LIRING/3 #juld do to help
his friends". "Rémulo" then went on to explain that one of his comrades was
expected to arrive in Mexico City "in the near future" and would need a se-
cure place to live, at least until he could find a place of his own. "Rézulo#
stressed that this person, whose identity be himelf did not aspet know, would
be traveling "clandestinely" and could not risk renting a room on his own
until he had established himself in the area. LIRING/3 replied that he, of
course, would do his best, but pointed out that he himself was not in a good
position to protect anyone. He finall agreed that this person night be able
to use his kitchen as temporary living quarters, entering and leaving the
apartment throught the back (service) entrance. LIRING/3 pointed out to "Róculo"
that the back door to the apartment house was locked at 1700 every day and
that therefore it would be necessary for the person using that entrance to
return to the apartment for good every night before 1700. "Rógulo" was ap-
parently satisfied with this offer of LIRING/3 and poised to let him know
when the person arrived in Mexico City.

less, no specific explanation was given LIRING-3 of his sponsor
and he requested none. LIRING-3 was told that TORMET would be
seeing him for some months, since ROWTON was leaving the country
for an indefinite period.
1 TO
4. LIRING-3 was told that although TORMET was trusted by
ROWTON and collaborated with him, he represented a different
organization. LIRING-3 was also told that although he had in the
past been receiving between 3,000.00 and 3,500.00 Mexican pesos
per month on an informal basis, TORMET's organization feit that
1,500 Mexican pesos per month ($120.00) would be a fair salary at
this stage of the operation. TORMET explained that he was aware
of LIRING-3's past activities directed against the Cubans, and the
resultant problems which had arisen. It was explained that
TORMET's interest was in Central American revolutionary activities.
In order to deal with LIRING-3's virtual "burned" status with the
Cubans, he was directed to tell any Central American contacts that
the Cubans no longer trusted him, and that he therefore was no
longer directly involved with any revolutionary groups or activities.
Nonetheless, LIRING-3 was directed to offer any assistance which
ne couia provive to any revolutionaries, un the Dasis of his
leftist beliefs and the friendships which he had made with FAR
members while in prison in Guatemala. It would then be a matter
of time before we could learn whether LIRING-3 was complete
blacklisted in all revolutionary circles because of his problems
with the Cubans or whether he could provide information of value.
5. LIRING-3 throughout the meeting seemed in good spirits
and he seemed to accept the turnover without any qualms. Indeed,
he pointed out that the Cubans had lost trust in him only after
he had been given various tasks to do by RUWTON which he had known
and warned in advance would cause suspicion. It was agreed that
LIRING-3's troubles were not of his own making, but that at this
stage all that could be done was to attempt to circumvent the
existing problems.
6. LIRING-3 was given a Station non-attributable telephone
number and false name to ask for (Identity) to set up meetings
with TORMET. Only the meeting time was to be set by phone, and
a prearranged pickup point was decided upon. It should be noted
that TORMET's QP vehicle was used for this first meeting with
LIRING-3, which means it was of course exposed to LIRING-3.
7. Subsequent to this meeting, LIRING-3 never initiated
contact with the Station. Although he might have lost the new

Indication he ever again tried to call ROWTON, who was in Mexico
for at least three weeks after the 1 July turnover to TORMET.
8. The Station assumes that for whatever reasons, LIRING-3
has in effect terminated himself. Given the nature of this case--
the fact that LIRING-3 was denounced in Cuban official circles as
a RVROCK agent, the fact that LIRING-3 in over two years was never
very productive and now the apparent decision of LIRING-3 to break
off contact--it has been decided to make no effort to reestablish
contact with him.

LIRING/3 told Horton that be expects "Rómulc" to revisit him et bis
home sometime during the late evening of 26/4/69. He told Howton that
it occurred to biz that he zight invited
Iden B

on the same night in the hope that he could witness a face-to-face meeting
with Rómulo" and Iden B. He felt that this would serve to keep his hands
as clean as possible in the eves of the LINING office, since he was certain
that Iden B
would report promptly of his meeting with "lo."

Roxton agreed, feeling that it was important for LIRIG/3 to bring
occasional meetings with "Rézulo" fully to the attention of the taking
office, on the off-chance that they already did not know about them, and
that Iden B
would be the best channel for this.

Ferzabal,
According to DINING/3, the young
Guatemalan told him that his friends back in Guatemala City continued
to have confidence in IIPING/3, but "had to respect the opinions of
others,and had no alternative but to discontinue correspondence with
LIRING/3,at least for a respectable period." He continued that DIRING/3
should realize that their organization in Guatemala City was in no
position to check out various and sundry charges made against their
friends and bed to let time take care of most of their problems of this
nature.

LIRIFG/3 told Rowton that be finally gave the unexpected house-quest
in the room of his entia, moving the letter to his studio.
He then asked the guest to remain as inconspicuous as possible, informing
him that he expected a number of children that afternnon for an art lesson
in the apartment. The Guatemalan promised to be out of the apartment during
the day and to return late & night. LINING/3 told Roxton that in fact he
did not reappear until about 2300 that night, and left before 0700 the
following morning. When he returned at about 2200 on the night of 24/4/69
he informed LINING/3 that he would be leaving the apartment the next morning
early and would not have to return. He thanked LIRING/3 profusely the
next morning (25/4/69) and left at about 0900 without telling LIRING/3
where he intend to go.
LIRING/3 continued to Rowton that at about 1930 on 23/4/69, when he returned
to his apartment, he found "Rógulo" ( Mario Mendez Aruilar) in his living
rooz having coffee with his wife. LIRING/3 took the occasion to tell Rómulo
about the unexpected houseguest. According to LIRING/3 "Rómulo" appeared
genuinely surprised and asked for the identity and physical description of
the person. When LIRING/3 told him as much as he knew, "Romulo" stated that:
he could not identify the person as a friend of his. He speculted that the
unannounced guest had been sent to check on. LIRING/) and advised him to
be cautious and as normal as possible in his routine while the person re-

this person had been sent by the LIRING office "to check on LIRING/3's
private life". "Rómulo" then offerred LIRING/3 a revolver for his self-
defense, but LIRING/3 turned it down, saying that he was not worried to
that extent. According to LIG/3, "Rómulo" stated that he himself pre-
ferred to avoid resting the young Guatemalan since he could not identify
hin. He reassured LIRING/3 that his own comrade who might also be in need

PBRUMEN capital and that he himself ("Rule") was in more or less regular
touch with the mother of "El Chino",(whom LIRING/3 understood tope Yon
Sosa). "Rómulo" also mentioned in passing that he works for two or three
hours a day in the accounts office of Ovaciones and also does some part
time work at a golf club in Mexico City.
E. Information/Guidance Given to agent:

formore specific
Rowton asked DIRING/3 to continue to press
information about his proposed assistance to LIRING/3 in obtaining a job
in FBRUMEN? AND some indication was to the extent of the imowledge and back-
ing of the LIRING office. Rowton did not encourage LIHING/3 to take such
a prospsal soliously until ne could get more concrete data from Iden B.
With regard to "Rómulo's" request for assistance, Ecwton stated that
he would be much more interested in this development, when and if LIRING/3
could get the identity of the comrade of "Rézule" whom he was to provide
a safehouse for. Rowton suggested that LIRING/3 put this person up when he
appeared for a few days, long enough to permit Rowton to get a look at him
and identify him. A determination could then be made as to the best course
of action for LIRING/3 with regard to this person. In reply to LIRING/3's
query, Rowton thought that it would be best to reinsure with the LIRING
office regarding this matter by casually mentioning to
he was performing this service for his PAR friends. LIRI: 6/3 agreed.com-
menting that he hoped that he would not again be caught in the crossfire
befween the LIRING Office and the nationalist faction of the FAR.

that be felt it best to send the money order in the name of Elsa,
the eldest of the León Barrios sisters, rather than to the mother
(Harta) as requested in the letter. He explained that the last money
order (actually certified bank check) in Elsa's name, sent by LIRING/",
arrived safely and apperently was cashed without difficulty. Howton
suggested that III.G/3 send the letter, reristered with receipt requested,
just to be sure that the letter arrived at its destination. .

2. Date & Site of Meeting:
1000, 5/5/69; Robin Restaurant.
3. Next Meeting:
1000, 7/5/59; same place.
4. Reports/Information Given by Agent:
LIRING/3 announced with apperent pleasure that at long last the
como channel with the PIR had been reopened. He stated that he
had just received a letter from the elder of the two León Barrios
brothers ( Miguel and Juén) indicating that in his mind the long
period of "probation" was over that and that closer contact could
be expected in the near future, mini we showed nowtol a
letter dated 28 April,1959, in the handwriting he stated he recog-
Len
nized as that of Niguel/Earrios, in which the writer, who signed
the letter as "Julio Antonio", informed LIRING/3 that he had just
been released from prison ("sanatorio") and was planning to leave
town until things cool off for him. LIRING/3 told Rowton that he
understood the double-talk of the writer to mean that he needed
money (Q.100) to travel to Hexico where he hoped to visit DIRING/3.
Rowton's photostat and translation of the letter is attached here-
with.
The envelope, postmarked Guatemala City,2/5/69, is addressed to
LIRING/4 (as previously requested by LIRING/3) and bears the re-
turn address J. Antonio Medina, 24 Calle 1-65,Zona 1, Guatemala,
and was sent special delivery. LIKING/3 told Roston that he did
not recognize the return address, and assured that it, as well as
the sender's name, Medina, was notional. He added that "Violeta"
was the code word for oper tional contact with anyone arriving
on behalf of the León Barrios brothers, and that Doña Luisa referred
to Marta, the mother of the León Barrios brothers.
i
!
When Rowton agreed that LIRING/3 should send some money, no more
that 1,000 pesos ( Q 80) with a cover letter from MIRING/4 (os-
tensibly) but in his own handwriting, explaining in double-talk
that fortunately he is doing fairly well financially and that
LIRING/4 is now working in an art gallery and expects to inherit
money from her father who recently passed away. LISING/3 promised
to have the cover letter and envelope ready when he met with Rowton
on 7/5/69 so that he could insert the money order. 1/3 told Rowton

My letter has two purposes: first to excuse myself for not being able
to get to your home; it's becasue, since I am still not recovered, the
doctor has told me to recuperate in the country, and, to avoid problems
these days, I'm planning to go to uncle Tío's farm.

My other purpose in writing to you is to bother you for a favor. I should
tell you that I have married Liz and she is now expecting a baby. (Finally
I was able to follow your advice). Now that I ar leaving for the farm,
she will be left alone and with some financial difficulties. Since you
had invited both of us there, and this is not possible, I hope you will
be able to send her something. I think she sculQ. 100 to very

exile group arrived in Panama on board an Argentine military aircraft.
It was further reported that on 10 September, this saze group
departed for Argentina via Gayaquil, Lisa, and Santiago. CONZALEZ,
described as a Guatemalan national, utilized safe conduct pass #12392

some interest to note that MENDEZ, although he gave
LIRING-3 the agreed upon recognition signal, may
still not be the "Pavel" LIRING-3 was told he would
meet. LIRING-3 was shown a photograph of Oscar
(201-841522) Arturo & PEREZ Ramirez (known to have serviced a

circulated in that country by Carlos PERZABAL Marcue.
Knowing that PERZABAL's father-in-law is a close
friend of Chief, LIRING, LIRING-3 sourced the rumors:
to the LIRING headman. He first took up the matter
of the accusations made against him with LIRING-9.
The latter said there was nothing to this, but, and
there was a but, LIRINC-9 reminded LIRING-3 that
in the past he had been connected "with a person of
mysterious and suspicious affiliations," a clear
reference to ROWTON, LIRING-3's Greek friend. When
LIRING-3 insisted he wanted to discuss the matter
of the allegations made against his directly with
Chief, LIRING, LIRING-9 promised to make an appoint-
ment for him. This appointment, however, never
materialized. That Chief, LIRING may have spread
the allegations made against LIRING-3 by PERZABAL
was confirmed by Rolando SUAREZ (see ROWTON's
report dated 31 December). LIRING-3 also took up
the matter of the PERZABAL denunciations with MENDEZ
who told him that the FAP had paid no attention to
them and even accompanied LIRING-3 to PERZABAL's
house. LIRING-3, however, made the mistake of
giving his name when asked who was calling. The
result, as could be expected, was that PERZABAL was
"not in."
MENDEZ agreed to accompany LIRING-3 to
LIPING to talk to its Chief, but he warned LIRING-3
not to make accusations without proof.

a few business transactions with him, including the sale of a number of
his paintings, but insisted with some annoyance that this had not bearing
on his political activity. LIRING/9 agreed and added that it was really a
thing of the past that should not bother LIRING/3. He promised to make an
appointment for LIRING/3 to see the Chief LIRING sometime the following week.
8. LIRING/3 continued that when he met with "Rómulo" later that morning he
also showed the letter from Martha to him. According to L/3, "Rómulo" became
indignant and suggested that they talk to Fersabal together to get to the
bottom of the matter. L/3 and "Rómulo" then took a taxi to the residence of
Persabal in the hope of finding him in at the time. When L/3, however, rang
the outside bell he was told by a woman ( who be suspects mix was either
Persabal's wife or sister-in-law) that Fersabal was not at hose. 1/3 noted
the woman's astonishment in cer scue of voice when he stated his name her
request. "Rómulo" who was present later commented that L/3 should hot have
given his name since it was obvious that x Fersabal was at home but did
not want to see LIRING/3.
9. According to 1/3, "Rómulo" at the second meeting stated that "several"
friends of his were planning to return to Guatemala to continue their work
for the PAR and that he hoped that LIRING/3 might be able to help in this
mission. "Rómulo" did not specify what kind of assistance he expected from
LIRING/3 but promised to give him details when the time came for action in
this matter. He promised to see L/3 again at 1600 on 24 December, 1968.

intensified.
They did not hide that their purpose
was to broadcast LIRING-3's name and the fact that
a Mexican had joined their fight. This was apparently
to appeal to the Mexican left and gain their support.
While LIRING-3 has declared himself ready to go back
to Guatemala (if this was what ROWTON wanted him to
do), he did not need ROWION to decide that broad-
casting his name from the jungles of Guatemala was
not a thing he wanted anyone to do. At Station ·
directive, LIRING-3 pointed out that after his
recent imprisonment he had to take care of his wife
before doing any more for the cause. The best way
to do this was to take LIRING-4 to PERUMEN and leave
her with relatives. This led LIRING-3 to ask what,
if anything, he could do for the FAR in Mexico.
So far, however, his FAR friends have not risen to
the bait.

LIRING/3 Report of Contact by "Pavel" of FAR.
1. LIRING/3 reported to Rowton at 1000 on 23/12/68 at the restaurant
in the Camino Real Hotel that at long last the FAR contact promised by
the León Barrios brothers had appeared. LIRING/3 told Rowton that at about
1900 on 19 December a Guatemalan came to his apartment and introduced
himself as "a friend of Violeta.* L/3 invited him in but asked him not to
discuss anything sensitive in the presence of his wife. After about ten
minutes of chit chat in the apartment, L/3 and the Guatemalan, who gave
his name simply as "Rómulo", went to a nearby restaurant to talk privately.
2. According to LIRING/3, the Guatemalan stated that he had been ordered
by FAR to maintain contact with L/3. When queried by L/3 regarding the
Humberto González Vega whom he had met previously, #mula" zalnidad,
"Oh, you mean 'El Gato' he's a good element, but he will not be your
FAR contact. I have been entrusted with that mission." "Rómulo" also stated
that he knew Francisco Lara well and had worked with him in Guatemala City
some time ago until Lara was arrested. "Rómulo" added that unfortunately
Lara's mother had betrayed him to the police and he barely escaped arrest
at that time. "Rómulo" confirmed that Lara had been under a cloud as far
as his superiors were concerned and had made the ill-fated trip
in order to attempt to clear himself of charges against him.
-
3. When LIRING/3 told "Rómulo" that he had been in touch with the LIRING
office since his return, the latter exclaimed, "But what have the LIKING
people to do with us?" This gave L/3 the definite impression that "Rómulo"
himself was not in touch with a PERUMEN representative in Mexico City, and,
in any case, did not like the LIRING establishment.
}
I
4. He then asked L/3 to give him a summary report of the arrest and detention.
L/3 told Rowton that he balked at this at first, protesting to "Rómulo" that
he had already given the details to the León Barrios brothers and "Cebollito"
who he was sure had passed on the report to the FAR in Guatemala. When
"Rómulo" explained that he would appreciate an oral report on the spot since
´he was not fully informed because of communications problems, LIRING/3 told
Rowton that he went over the whole episode for "Rómulo's" benefit. "Rómulo"
then asked to see LIRING/3 again at 1100 on 21 December to continue their
discussion. He promised to meet L/3 on the street in front of his apartment
house at the appointed time.
5. LIRING/3 continued to Rowton that much to his surprise and indignation
he received a letter on the following day(20/12/68) from Martha, the mother

a) Contact of Carlos López: 1/3 reported that about 1430 cn 24 December
as he and his wife arrived at their apartment, they found a "chaparite
who introduced himself as Carlos López, a Guatemalan friend of
Jacobo Rodríguez(Padilla), and gave L/3 a note of introduction from
that person. L/3 gave Rowton the original letton, which is attached
herewith. L/3 told Rowton that López stated that he was anxious to
send various items, including medicines, to FBRUMEN, and appealed to
L/3 since he "understood" that 1/3 and his wife had contacts through
which he could send the items. López, according to 1/3 appeared very
interested to be reassured that L/3 really did have good contacts
with the LIRING establishment. When L/3 assured him that he did see
LIRING respresentatives, López went on to reveal that he was a friend
of Carlos Perzabal and that he was fully informed concerning the
recent "tragic situation" of both Persabal and LIRING/3. This bomb
shell shock L/3 badly and he felt obliged to launch into a diatribe
against Perzabal. When López commented that "naturally we have to
take Ferzabal's word against yours, since he know him better," L/3
told Rowton that he demanded an explanation of who the "we" were.
López simply replied that it meant "infortant" persons in Guatemala
and Mexico. He added that, "as you know", Persabal was known even to
César Montes. L/3 retorted, "But Montes has been stripped of his
authority, as you should know." This led L/3 to the counterclaim that
he also had good friends in Guatemala and Mexico who could testify on
bis behalf.
:
LIRING/3 told Rowton that he then showed López a photostatic copy
of the attached letter which he had written to Perzabal demanding
an explanation of the calumnies he was known to be spreading against
him, and which he/lready sent to the CP Mexico and Spain. He
asked López to keep the copy and tell his good friend Ferzabal where
he got it and under what circumstances.
LIRING/3 continued to Rowton that he had to cut short the rather
1 heated exchange with López since he had a date at 1600 that same
day with "Rómulo" outside his apartment house.

b) Contact with "Rómulo": LIRING/3 told Rotton that he again sas
Rómulo, the FAR liaison, outside his apartment house at about 1610
on 24 December, as prearranged. In view of what had transpired a
fax short time earlier that afternoon, he told Rómulo about the
comments made by Carlos López. Rómulo, according to L/3, did not
indicate that he knew Lopez at all, but agreed with 1/3 that the
accusations of Perzabal must be met head-on. He suggested the fol-
lowing course of action: L/3 should wait for the reply froz Marta
(mother of León Barrios brothers) as to the exact charges made by
Perzabal before taking up the matter with the Chief LIRING.
tended to agree with L/3 that the LIRING establishment might have
inspired Ferzabal's letter, but felt it would be better if L/3
had a statement from Marta before accusing the PBRUMENers of bad
Suith with his. true 22 that in the meantime he would try to
arrange a confrontation with Perzabal in the presence of three
"important FAR officials in Mexico", including a certain "Julis2
also known as "Buda". Rómulo felt that Buda could lure Perzabal to
a private meeting sinne the latter txr already had interviewed
him some time ago and would be anxious to see him again. This would
provide a good pretext for a confrontation between Perzabal and
LIRING/3 to clear up the whole matter.
C) Proposed Meeting with LINING Chief: LIRING/3 told Rowton that he
felt it essential to see the LIKING Chief on the morning of 27 Dec
even if he does not receive a reply from Marta by that time, ão
explained that he felt he could get some sort of statement from the
LIKING Chief, either affirming or denying his knowledge of the
Perzabal letter so that he could use this in a possible meeting with
the latter in the presence of Rómulo and his colleagues. He said
that he felt this important in view of a possible invitation to
PBRUMEN that he might receive momentarily.
5. Information/Guidance Given to Agent: Rowton cautioned L/3 against jumping
the gun in accusing the LIRINGS of inspiring the Ferzabal letter,
po inting out that it could just as easily and logically have come
from such Guatemalan exiles as Navarette, Capuano, or even persons
of the César Montes group, who are expected to be close to the
LIRINGS and the CPM as well as possibly the PTG

of the León Barrios brothers, in which, among other things, she stated that
"the man on the bicycle", which L/3 explained to Howton meant Carlos
Persabal
had written a letter containing grave charges
against LIRING/3. The letter, which L/3 read aloud to Roxton, went on to
assure L/3 that these charges were not believed but constituted a source
of annoyance to the writer's friends.
}
6. LIRING/3 continued to Rowton that he felt so indignant and shocked at
this unpleasant development that he decided to see the Chief LIKING and
have it out with him. L/3 explained that since the Chief LIRING is on very
friendly terms with the father-in-law of Persabal he might be aware of the
letter and even possibly encourgaged Persabal to write it. L/3 told Rowton
that he then got in touch with LIKING/2 by telephone and made a date to meet
nim at the LIKING establishment at 0930 on 21/12/68. when he arrived at the
gate at that time he was told that IIRING/2 had not yet arriveed. After a wait
of some twenty minutes, LIRING/2 appeared but asked LIRING/3 to wait a little
longer since he was very busy. After another annoying wait, LIRING/9 appeared
instead of LIRING/2 and talked with LIRING/3 on the patio. LIRING/3 explained
that he wanted urgently to talk with the Chief LIRING since something bad
come up with regard to Persabal. He reminded LIRING/9 that he originally had
exppressed a desire to have a face-to-face confrontation with Persabal in
the LIRING office so that he could present his report on the arrest in his
presence. LIRING/9, according to LIKING/3, brushed this off again with the
comment, "But as I told you before, you're making a mountain of a molehill.
You're exaggerating the whole business."
7. LIRING/3 told Rowton that he then took out Martha's letter and insisted
that LIRING/9 read it. The latter expressed amazement at the revelation of
Persabal's action but did not agree with LIRING/3 that the Chief LIRING
would be able to shed light on it. LIRING/3 then told LIRING/9 that he did
not like the games that everyone seemed to be playing with him, and asked
LIRING/9 point blank what it was that motivated him to ask for a written
report of the arrest and, after L/3 complied with the request, to graɛ bis
feet. L/3 continued that he felt he had been frank with the LIRING office,
whereas on the other hand they were not honest with him in telling him what
they thought of him. L/9 then assured L/3 of his confidence inhim and added
that in the past certain persons, including Hugo, the assistant to LIRING/11,
had felt thatLIRING/3 had been connected with a person of mysterious and
suspicious affiliations. L/3, understanding this to be a clear allusion to
Rowton, admitted to having known this person in the past and having had

LIRING/3 Identification of "Rómulo" Reported FAR Lisaison.
>
1. At 1100 on 28 December, 1968, LIRING/3 reported to Pouton at the
1900
Camino Real restaurant that be had again met briefly with "Rómulo"
in front of bis (L/3's) apartment house about 1600 on 27/12/68. On
this occasion "Rómulo" identified himself as Mario Mendez and promised
to give LISING/3 a telephone at which he could be contacted in the fu-
ture.
2. With regard to the Perzabal accusations, "Rómulo" again cautioned
LIRING/3 against jumping the gun with the Chief of LINING ( i.e. accusing
him of having inspired the charges), since if the LIRING Chief called
his bluff, I/3 would have no proof. "Rómulo" recommended that L/3 wait
until he received a reply from Marta giving details of the accusations
before proceeding further. He added that at that time he and his ollesses
would gladly confront Persabal and clear up the matter.
3. LIRING/3 described "Rómulo" as a Guatemalan of about 28 years of age,
5'6", 125 lbs, sraight black thinning hair, small eyes,clipped moustache.
1/3 added that "Rómulo" frequently squints his eyes, either from a nervous
habit, or some physical defect. LIRING/3 drew Howton a rough sketch of
"Rómulo" as he recalled him from the three brief meetings he has had with
him to date.
4. LINING/3 also gave Rowton the original of the letter from Marta daxKİ
postmarked 18 December, 1968, in which mention was made of the Perzabal
charges. 1/3 reminded Rowton that Perzabal is referred to in the letter
as "el hombre de la bicicletas and that the León Barrios brothers (sous
of Marta) as "los patojos."
5. LIRING/3 also gave Rowton the original letter of KEXXHE Oscar Moisés
Roldán Espinoza dated 27 November, 1968, which LIRING/3 had received on
1 December, 1968. The envelope bears the same return address as that of
7 November, 1968. Roldán encloses the negative of a snapshot of himself
as a "recuerdo." The letter contains general greetings and a plea for
whatever help L/3 can manage to give Roldán.
6. LIRING/3 asked Howton's approval to send 500 pesos to Marta (via ber
sister) to encourage her to continue writing him and keeping him inforzəd
of what develops, especially if and when her sons are released. Rowton
agreed but stressed that L/3 should explain that he had managed to have
this extra money as a result of his recent exposition and to regret that
he could not send more.

Subject: LIRTNG/3 Report of Necting with FLR Members in Hexico City.
1. LIRING/3 reported to Rowton at the Robin Restaurant at 1700 on 30/12/68
that when he returned to his apartment at about 1200 on 28/12/68 be
found Mario Mendez (aka "Bómulo") waiting in the company of another FAR
member, whom L/3 described as "very fat" aged about 26 with a dropping
moustache. L/3 told Rowton that since he did not wish to involve his wife
in conversation with these persons, invited them outside to a nearby res-
taurant.
2. According to LIKING/3 Hario Mendez and his friend told him that FAR
had decided finally to withdraw all its forces from the cities and to
regroup in the mountains, in view of the insmessing "prod" and the
virtual impossibility of effective action in the urban areas of Guatemala.
They stated that they and a number of their comrades in Mexico were pianning
to return to Guatemala and join the FAR forces in the mountains. They then
invited LIKING/3 to accompany them on their return trip, feeling that is
that way he could contribute more to the struggle. In reply to L/3's queries
they did not specify how L/3 was to survive another trip and in fact be
of any use to them in the mountains. They simply said that they felt it
would be useful to give vide publicity to 1/3's presence in the mountains,
once he reached that area. L/3 told Rowton that he reacted to this sczewhat
startling proposal in as logical a way as possible, saying that he would
have it give it careful thought, inasmuch as it raised a number of very
serious problems with him and his family. Mario Mendez and his friend con-
cluded with a rousing cheer for the "real revolutionaries" who put asile
all thoughts of personal safety and comfort and rush into the battle. Thea
L/3 pointed out that they themselves after all had withdrawn from the action
they replied that precisely for that reason they intended to return and
do their share for the cause.
I
3. LIRING/3 also reported that he and his wife spent the 29th of December
with Orlando Suarez in Cuernavaca and had lunch with him and Jorge Godoy.
Suarez remarked privately to 1/3 that he had visited the LIRING offices on
24-25 December and was "not pleased" with comments he had heard concerning
LIRING/3. He recommended that L/3 see the Chief LINING"as soon as possible"
to put the record straight concerning the circumstances surrounding his
arrest and especially his subsequent release. Suarez intimated that the
Chief MINING apparently favored the version given by Perzabal, with whose
in-laws he was on very close personál terms. LIRING/3 told Rowton that be
planned to try again to meet privately with the Chief LIKING on the morning
of 31 December, 1958.

4. In reply to Rowton's questions concerning the identity of the following
names that appear in the letters to him from Marta Barrios de León, LIXING/3
made the following clarifications:
1) "Los canchitos" and "Los patojos" refer to Juan and Miguel Leán
Barrios.
2) "Elsa" is the true name of the eldest León Barrios sister (apparent
age 25),
3) "La negra is a León Barrios sister aged about 14.
4) "La chiquita" is a six-year-old sister of the León Barrios brothers.
5) "Felissa" is the novia of Juán José León Barrios.
6) "Yuri" is a child, probably of Maria Elena, who is a close friend
and possibly relative of the León Barrics family.
" La gordita" and "Cari" whose identity L/3 Lever learned are both
active members of FAR who frequently visited the León Barrios
brothers and acted as PAR couriers.
E
5. LIRING/3 told Rowton that as regards the prexṛemed proposed revisit to
Guatemala, he was prepared to discuss this with Howton and would be willing
to undertake the hazardous mission, "if there were no other alternative",
but that in any case careful plans would have to be worked out especially
with regard to commuuications, if Rowten hoped to profit by L/3's rezewed
involvement with FAR in Guatemala.

LIBING/3 Heport of Meeting at PAR Safehouse.
1. At 2100 on 1/1/69 at the Robin Restaurant LIki.G/3 reported to Rowton
that he went, as requested by "Rómulo", to Calle Coahuila 221 (across
from Woolworths near the corner of Insurgentes Sur) and found "Rómulo"
}
in apartment 12 in the company of two other persons, previously unknown
to LIRING/3. Both appeared younger than "Rózulo" and one could easily be
his brother because of the physical resemblance. The other, apparent age
25, light skinned, who was introduced simply as an Ecuadoriar, had a good
Guatemalan accent, and revealed in his remarks an excellent knowledge of
Guatemala. The Ecuadorian, who had the most pleasant personality of the
three, remarked during the conversation that he had been imprisoned in
the old penitentiary in Guatemala City and subsequently "thrown" over the
border to Saivasor.
2. LIRING/3 told howton that the small apartment contained nothing that he
could see but a table and several chairs and was obviously a safehouse
rather than a residence. "Rómulo” later confirmed this when he told L/3
that they would have to meet there in the future only by appointment since
they did not live there but came only from time to time to talk. is a re-
sult, LIRING/3 made a date with them for 1600 on Friday, 3/1/69, at which
time he, L/3, would come to the apartment. "Rómulo" promised to wait for him
at the entrance to the apartment building so that L/3 would not have to
ring the bell and wait outside the door unnecessarily.
$
3. During the friendly discussion that ensued in the apartment,L/3 took
the line previously agreed on with Rowton with apparent success. The young
Ecuadorian showed his approval by nodding his head several times, when L/B
outlines his reasons for not accepting at once the proposal to return to
Guatemala. "Romulo" was less sympathetic, and when L/3 stated that he felt
it recessary in any case to travel first to PBRUMEN to get his wife settled
"Rómulo" shrugged his shoulders, remarking, "But can't she get by herself."
L/3 then offerred to be of any service while in FBRUEEN, but did not re-
ceive any positive reaction. "Rómulo" responded simply with a "Yes, we'll
see.
L/3 made sure to drop the statement that he was planning as a matter
of fact to see LIRING/9 the following morning to talk about the trip which
about
L/9 himself had already volunteered to arrange.
4. When the subject of Ferzabal's calumnies against L/3 came up toward the
end of the conversation, "Rómulo" told L/3: "Don't worry about that any more.
A guatemalan, whom you don't know, will take care of that matter 'de una vez'
1/3 told Howton he felt this remark was too full of foreboding for him to
ask for details. He agreed to come again to the apartment at 1600 on 3/1/69.

LIRING/3 Report of Allegation of NOPIAM Affiliation.
1. At 1000 on 7 January, 1969, at the restaurant of the Camino Real Hotel
LIRING/3 reported to Rowton that be had just received three letters from
Harta Barrics de León, the mother of the León Barrios brothers (Miguel
and Juán) whom he had originally set during his confinement in Guatemala
City. He gave the original letters, Rowton's translation of which is
attached, to Roston to copy and study. LIRING/3 appeared genuinely shaken
at the revlation in the second paragraph of the letter,dated 29/12/68,
that the "man on the bicycle" ( Carlos Perzabal) had written in his letter
to Marta that LIRING/3 was "working for another company (NCPIRM) and that
Korte ehnuila nnt confide in onething LIVING/2 night write to how #ITHING/3
told Roston that he had suspected that Perzabal had accused him of perhaps
causing the arrest, but he never dreamed that Ferzabal would go so far as
to accuse biz outright of being a #CFIRM agent.
U
2. LIRING/3 then speculated that Farzabal could not have done such a series
thing of his own initiative, but rust necessarily have been inspired by
some outside source, most probably the LIRING establishment. He continued
that he therefore felt it more necessary than ever to put the LIRING Chief
"up against the wall" and force his to admit his complicity. LIRING/3 added
that he had seen "Rómulo" on 3 January as planned and had told him about
the letter from Marta and Ferzabal's treachery. According to LIKING/3
"Rómulo" became indignant and volunteered to accompany LIKING/3 to the
LIRING establishment to have the whole thing out once and for all. LIKING/3
appeared so disturbed at the unexpected news that Rowton found it impossible
to check with him on the exact time and place he allegedly met "Rémulo" on
Friday, 3/1/69. Then Rowton stated that he felt it very important to iden-
tify "Rómulo" positiviely ( Rowton alleged that he had access to the Gober-
nación “mug file" of persons wanted by the Guatemalan Government and given
to the Mexicans for identification), LIRING/3 volunteered to arrange to
meet "Rómulo" somewhere in public as soon as possible so that koston could
get a good look at him ( as he had previously done in the case of "Garcia").
3. Rowton advised LIRING/3 6 not under any circumstances to attempt to
lure "Rómulo” to any public place, especially since the latter had estab-
lished a pattern of meeting with him in a safehouse, but simply to tell
Rowton the next time he was invited to visit the safehouse and Howton hould
cover the place from as convenient a spot as possible (e.g. Woolwork
across the street). Howton also encouraged RING/3 to talk again with
LIRING/9 rahher than the Chief LIRING IN THE hope of more production.

intensified. Tuty did not hide that their purpose
was to broadcast LIRING-3's name and the fact that
a Mexican had joined their fight. This vas apparently
to appeal to the mexican left and gain their support.
While LIRING-3 has declared himself ready to go back
to Guatemala (if this was what KONTON wanted him to
do), he did not need ROTTO to decide that road-
casting his name from the jungles of Quatemala was
not a thing he wanted anyone to do. At Station
directive, LIRING-3 pointed out that after his
recent imprisonment he had to take care of his wife
before doing any more for the cause. The best way
to do this was to take LIRING-4 to FERUMEN and leave
her with relatives. This led LIBING-3 to ask what,
if anything, he could do for the FAR in Mexico.
So far, however, his FAR friends have not risen to

LIRING/3 Report of Address of Mario Mendez, aka "Rózulo".
i
1. LIRING/3 reported to Rowton at 1000 on 1/1/69 at the Robin Zestaurant
that he had not succeeded in seeing the Chief LIRING as he had hoped the
previous morning since the latter did not appear at his office by 100O,
when LIRING/3 had to leave to make the contact with "Rómulo" at his apart-
ment. LIKING/3 continued to Rowton that when he arrived at his apartment
about 1015 be found a note from "Rómulo" asking him to come to the follow-
ing address at between 1130-1200 the following day ( 1 January, 1969):
Calle Coahuila 221.
2. Rowton therefore made another date with LIRING/3 for that same evening
at 400 at the Robin Restaurant in ondor to get 1/2's report be
ing. Ecaton showei LINING/3 the two pictures passed to him by the Station
of persons suspected of being "Rómulo" and the fat colleague. LIRING/3
told Rowton that he could see no resemblance to either person, but be felt
that the photo of the stort person corresponded to the description of the
"Pavel" he was supposed to meet. He recalled that at the time the León
Barrios brothers told him they would arrange for "Favel" to contact his
in Mexico City uppa his return, they showed him a rather poor reproduction
of a picture of Pavel that had appeared in the local press following a
gunfight that Favel had had on the border while crossing into Mexico.
3. kowton then expressed to LIRING/3 his grave reservations concerning
the proposed travel of L/3 to Guatemala in the company of his new FAR
friends. Rowton pointed out that such a trip would be extremely risky for
L/3 personally with little hope of any worthwhile production for Howton.
LIRING/3 agreed and said that he felt he would have to continue to stall,
even at the risk of alienating the affections and confidence of his new
contacts. Rowton suggested that L/3 tell them that before he could possibly
consider such a return trip he would have to visit FERUMEN with his wife
and child to get them settled there so that they would not again be exposed
to the difficulties they suffered during his last trip financial as well
-
as psychological. This would give L/3 at least another month before he
would be faced with the trip. Rowton added that L/3 should offer to do
"everything possible" in Mexico for his friends, reviewing for them his
knowledge and experience of the border areas, his service in the navy as
vell as his reasonably good knowledge of photography.
4. Rowton then stressed that L/3 should assume that everything,at least in
summary form, that he discussed with the FAR officials he was in contact
with would directly or indirectly be reported to the LINING office, and that
hence he should "play it straight" with both sides.

in Mexico and a suspected PBLIJVEN coatact. The
Station had the LIERACE team cover the entrance
of the building where BLADE and other FAR members
have an apartment they use for clandestine zeetings
with LIRING-3. Despite the fact that the team
knows .IKING-3 from previous surveillance and that
a cosy of LIRING-3's sketch of N was also
provided, the LIEMBRACE otted neither man. The
Station naturally plans to cover another meeting
and is also exploring the possibility of determining
who rented the apartment and from whoa. It is of
some interest to note that WANDEZ, although he gave
LIRING-3 the agreed upon recognition signal, may
still not be the "Pavel“ LIZING-3 was told he would
neet. LIRING-3 was shown a photograph of Decar
Arturo PERIZ Hamirez (known to have serviced a
letter drop in sexico City used by Michelle Jeannette
FIRK before her death in Guatemala). LIRING-3.
thought it looked like a poor print of a photograph
of "Pavel" shown to him while still lacarcerated.

several letters (see paragraph 2) from members of
the FAN in Guatemala warning him that adverss runars

circulated in that country by Carlos PERZABAL Harcue.
Knowing that PERZABAL's father-in-low is a close
Wriend of Chief, LIKING, LINING-3 sourced the rumors
to the LIRING heataan. Le first took up the matter
of the accusations sade against him with LIBING-6,
The letter said there was nothing to this, but, and

ment for hin. This appointment, however, never
materialized. That Chief, LIZING may have spread
the allegations made against LIRING-3 by PERZABAL
was confirmed by Rolando *SUAREZ (see RC#TON's
report dated 31 December). LIBING-3 also took un
the matter of the PERZABAL denunciations with MENDEZ,
who told him that the FAR had maid no attention to
them anʼi oven accompanied LIBING-3 to PEÄZABAL':

giving his name when asked who was calling. The
result, as could be expected, was that PERZABAL was
"not in.” MENDES agreed to accompany LIRING-3 to
LIRING to talk to its Chief, but be warned LIRING-3
not to make accusations without proof.

This is interesting. in view of the fact that

suspected contact of the PBRUNEVers.

been greatly disturbed by the accusations made

Dear Carlos:
Excuse me for not having replied to yours of 12 November until today,
but the affairs of the "patojos" keep me on the go and besides I have
been sick and upset and I keep forgetting everything. That's the reason
I haven't put a date on this letter; you won't believe it but I write
two letters that never Ect off, but it's true. We hope that you are as
well as ever with your family.
I have to tell you that the "hombre de la bicicleta" wrote me last week
and that I am a little peeved at bin because he speaks ill of rou. You
should move cautiously, but don't think that it's a problem with us
we don't believe it. We feel that it's from fear. I lost his address
and for that reason don't intend to write to him.
"El vigotudo" sends you regards; Ia negra a warm embrace; la chiquita
a kiss; Elsa. Felisacari,Maria Elena, Guri and the "patojos" many regaras
and embraces for the Chirstmas holidays. The "patojos" are still in the
"pina" so they couldn't come. We'll see whether they can be with us the
24th; if not we'll have to go there to be with them. In any case I'll let
you know when they come here.
So long with many best wishes and congratulations to you and your wife and
children. Excuse the long and boring letter.

Gautemala, 29.December, 1968.
Carlos,
I'm writing this after returning from the farm where I had a chat with
"les carches"; your three z letters came the same day, as well as the
postcard which is very attractive. Thanks for all your trouble. In yours
of the 20th you ask me to send a letter to the ".." I don't under-
stand where you mean, and to whom, since I don't recognize those initials.
Please explain to me clearly what you xean so that I can comply.
As to the letter from the "an on the bicycle", I mislaid it since I didn'o
like what it said, but if I can locate it I'll send it to you, as the
"patojos" told me to from the beginning, so that you can have an exact
account of it. I, however, thought the weight they gave to it exaggerated.
In any case he wrote to tell me that you were working for another company
(CIA)
end for that reason I shouldn's confide in anything that you right
write to me. But I'm very sincere in that respect and for that reason I
got very angry. Consider this, that when you both were here;, the mother
of that person was very nice to re, lavishing flattery and gifts on se,
for which I am sincerely grateful and do not forget, but his action doesn't!
seem (honest) to me. be all have to be loyal and faithful to our convictions
and not be shameless with respect to our comrades; we have to be respon-
sible in all our actions.
I haven't been able to write until today since I'm running around toin ar-
ranging things. All this must be boring to you. Receive greetings from
Kiguel, chiquita, negra, Maria,Felisa, my grandson, Elsita, Gorditaani
Cari. Also my own "abrazos" and good wishes.

Lesbia (La Negrita") sends you fond remembrances. Excuse.
red pen and the bad handwriting. Imagine! you fooled all of us
since we thought you had made the Christmas card yourself, -since
you paint so well, but you's not going to believe that. I'=
writing you just a few lines because zazá didn't leave me zuch
space. Greetings to your wife and children, even though I haven's
had the pleasure of meeting them. So long,

Carlos,
I send you by best, wishing that you and your family are well.
Everything here is the same as when you were with us. He learned
that your trip was good in all respects.
You can settle with the "Chino" the accounts you left bere. He's
going to send you two postcards that are very interssting. I trust
you'll appreciate how difficult it was for us to find them among so
sany attractive cards we have here.
You can write to ña Luisa. Greetings and "hasta pronto."
/s/ Violet?
