WEEK'S Miarhi bureau chief, William
Schmidt, filed this report:"
The strong, sweet smell, of Cuban cof-
fee forms an invisible but pungent bor-
der around à 600-block section of down-
town Miami known as "Little Havana."
There the refugees from Castro's Cuba
are prospering amid a profusion of their
own restaurants, shops, pharmacies, fac-
tones, construction firms and banks. The
exles have become so visible and so suc-
bessful that last year the Dade County
Commission passed a resolution proclaim
ing Metropolitan Miami officially bilingual
and biculturál. "The Cubans," says Ber-,
nardo Benes, the Cuban-born vice presi
dent of a local bank, "fit in perfectly
with the stories you Americans like so

But not everyone in the Miami area
appreciates the Cubans accomplish-
ments. In fact, the refugees are begin-
ning to encounter an anti-Cuban back-
lash. The friction between Cubans-and
their "Anglo" neighbors is different from
the problems faced by most minority
groups in the nation, if only because
here tag Cubans have become the mas
jority-52 per cent of the population in
Miami, 55 per cent in suburban Hialeah.
But their numbers and their success are
the heart of the problem. I've never
seen anti-Cuban feeling so bad," says
Rafael Villaverde, a Bay of Pigs veteran
turned community organizer in Little
Havana. "Before, the Cubans were-com-
peting for l

competing for the job of bank president,
Corporation executive, even mayor. We
ate starting to step on toes."

Why should I have to learn Spanish?

That is one of the non-Latins' most
persistent complants. A particular tar-
get of their outrage has been a bilingual
education program requiring thousands
of Enghyli-speaking children in eight ele-
mentary schools to learn Spanish while
Lätin students are learning English. Last
November, the Anglo community rose up
to elect to the school board a vehement
opponent of such programs, replacuig

the program curtailed, and the resent-

Killing: Many Cubañis these days do
hot cling as tenaciously as they once did:
to the notion of going back to a liberated
Cuba: "Morally, we are still at war with
Castro," says Max Lesnick, Cuban publish-
er of the Spanish-language magazine Re-
plica. "But realistically we know the sit-
ation is different. We have been in Nti-
ami for a long time. We pay taxes here;
our children go to school here. This, is
where we live." The dichards, however,
are not so realistic. Two weeks ago,
Luciano Nieves, 43; a former captain
in Castro's army, was shot to death in a
Miami parking lot only a few days after
Replica quoted humigas advocating peace
ful coexistence with Cuba. The killing,
police believe, was the work of anti-
Castro terrorists who may have been res
sponsible for as many as 50 bombings
during the past year. A few days after
the murder, a "hit-list", was issued tar-
geting a dozen other prominent exiles.
Despite their fraternal struggles and
their fierce ethnic pride, the Cuban-
Americans are steadily moving into the
American mainstream. What they need
now is political power. "We were eco-
nomically successful, years ago," says
Miami city commissioner Manolo Re-
boso, who in 1973 became the first
Cuban-American to be elected to office
in Florida. "Political power did not seem
important at the time." Currently, Cu-
bans account for only 16 per cent of
The Cubans are themselves divided
over the issue of U.S. détente with
Castro's Cuba. More and more exiles
are grudgingly giving up the notion of
liberating Cuba any time soon-but there'
are those who refuse to concede dè-
teat. Last month, that difference of opin-
ion apparently led to a killing in Miami
and the threat of more violence to come,
Scuffle: Much of the Anglo-Cuban - the registered voters in Miami and 25
ancor has been erupting in changing
neighborhoods. In one southwest Miami
community, Cuban and Anglo, families
have been feuding for months; in. Jan-
arv, a shot was fired during one scuf-
fle. "There is a real, bitterness, now in
many middle-class white communities,
per cent in Hialeah. But they are be-
ginning to sign up for U.S. citizenship
in record numbers and to demand jobs
as civil servants, policemen and teachers.
The Cubans may never jump into the
melting pot, but they have what it takes.
