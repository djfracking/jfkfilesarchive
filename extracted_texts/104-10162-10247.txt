Subject is aware that the story of his "irmigration" to
the USA is also weak. Se tried to explain this away by stating that
be "got out by mistake", that he was permitted to go "to hide the
Soviet shaze surrounding the Cuban crisis", that "someone had
committed an error", etc. He admitted that there exists no other
explanation as to why the Soviet government would have permitted
him to leave the US53 as, in the eyes of the Soviet goverment, be
was a full fledged and responsible Soviet citizen who had no
genuine or legitimate clain to American citizenship. As a result,
Subject is unusually sensitive to this topic.
5. CONCLUSION:
8. In the opinion of the undersigned, Subject should not be
considered for either ARSCREEN or AUCXPLORE despite the fact both
His English and Russian are native.
b. On the basis of the interview, the undersigned feels that,
Subject is less than frank and that be is prevaricating. Moreover,
there exist imunerable items in Subject's tale which are indicative
both that he worked as a recruited agent of the KGB (and its
predecessor organizations) in the US and that he left the US only
through mi with the intercession of the KGB.
6. It should be underscomd that because of the unique and sensitive
cover used by the undersigned, no attempt was made to resolve the various
contradictions, to challenge Subject on any of his statements, or to
pursue certain points of their logical conclusion. The foregoing vas
obtained in the form of an interview and no real attempt could be made,
given the cover, to delve more deeply into the suspicious aspects of
Subject's background.

STREET
Blauvelt engineering firm for whom he worked from January 1963
through July 1964. In 1904 Subject found work with Earold J.
SOLDEN, 60 Broad Street, Red Bank, New Jersey, as an engineer
working on the planning and designing of sub-divisions, grading,
construction developments, etc. His immediate supervisor is the
township er vineer of Marlboro Township, New Jersey. Els present
salary is $100.00 per month.
Y.
In April 1963 Subject married
Bella MINCBORG nee MILSTEIN
a Polish Jew who had come to the USA from Poland in 1949. She has
come by her fig(s). Subject and his son now live
in the home of his present wife.
4.
Comments and Assessment:
Subject speaks native English and passes for a middle class
American. His Russian is likewise native.
b. According to Subject, his objective in life now is to work
for the US Government. He states that he has submitted Forms 57 to
a number of the US Goverment agencies (be did not elaborate). In
applying for the position under AFLORE, Subject asked for $10,000.00
per annum which is his asking price for a position with the US Governmest.
C. According to Subject, his present position is excellent with
great potential for going into partnership as soon as he becomes a
licensed engineer. Sovever, he states that he is not interested in
making money (despite his request for a $10,000.00 salary) but in "right-
ing Communism' as an exployee of the US Coverment.
d. Subject admitted that he was a firm and strong believer of
Commiss which, incidentally, was the reason why he remained behind

that be continued to be a firm believer of Communism until approximately
1958/59 when he became "disenchanted with Communism". Subject
denies that he was a member of the Komsomol or that he had to join the
Commist Party, this despite the fact that he became an officer of
the Soviet Army and despite the fact that he was accepted to study
at the Institute of Marxism-leninis. Despite his alleged "disenchest.
ment" with Communism, Subject spoke in flattering terms about life
in the USSR, about the "democracy", about equal opportunities, about
the excellent "educational system", et cetera. Subject aimitted that

neither life in the USSR nor the Soviet authorities mistreated him.

In reply to my query, Subject indicated that in 1958 the
KB tried to co-opt him into reporting a fellow student at the
Institute of Marxism-Leninism. Sovever, Subject states that be
reject the pitch. In reply to various queries which were posed
to him about the fellow-student (name allegedly now forgotton),
Subject states that he dič render an unfavorable report on the person.
Despite this, the particular Soviet was nitimately assigned abroad
es an interpreter. Subject later heard that the Soviet worked and
traveled : both Japan and Italy.

In reply to a general query about life is the USSR, Subject
indicated that life in the USSR has made him into "an accomplished pre-
Taricator".
h. Subject vas less than fluent in relating the story of his
life to the undersigned. He made mistakes frequently, be contra-
dicted himself, be altered dates to accomodate other aspects of
Mis activities to correspond with that he had mentioned earlier, etc.
Also, Subject repeatedly tried to digress from relating his story
into presenting his views of life; it was a chore to keep him on
substantive matters relating to his own backgrund.
1. Subject's brother, Eugene, is now employed as an engineer
of the Freehall Township, New Jersey. Additionally, he has a
private office in Rockland, New Jersey, called the Civil Engineer
Associates.

of his mother's application for Scriet citizenship for herself.
Be tinself admitted to the undersigned that this is illogical as
his brother, Bugene, hose status was no different from Subject's,
Dever acquired Soviet citizenship "by default" though Subject did
allegedly without any action whatever on his own part. Moreover,
Subject admitted that be was legally of age (15) by this time and
no longer a dependent as a result of which he would have had to apply
for a Soviet passport and for Soviet citizenship of his own free
volition rather than through his mother.

Soviet foreign passport. In the U. S. Embassy in Moscow I filled in si-

SUPPLEMENT
to
AUTOBIOGRAPHY
of
IRVING APRON
During the years I spent in the Soviet Union I had many friends.
Among them were writers, journalists, engineers, doctors and professionals
in different fields. It would be very difficult to list all of them. For
instance, during the last year I met a new neighbour in the building I moved
into. He was a professor in the field of economics. His name was Earshy and
he told me many things which I never knew about concerning the econtric
basis of the Soviet s stem. He noted that with an industrial labour force
exceeding the labour force of the U. S. A. by 100% the productivity of
labour and industrial production vasthree times lower.

While studying in high school I became acquainted with a well-known
movie producer Alexander Stolper. He is the brother of one of the students
with whom I was freidly in high school. Besides, through a friend in college
I met with several writers and journalists such as Dykhovichny, Slobodskoy,
and others writing in the field of satire.
People working in clarified fields of industry never talk about their
work. And even though my relatives through my wife in Russia worked in the
fieldof aviation and electronics I did not know anything about their ork.
I only knew that my vicale h-other worked in 111, her brother-in-law
worked near Sckel (both in Moscow). Her brother's name is Lev Minkin and
her brother-in-law's name is Boris Bershadsky.
During te last years I worked as a translator and met many people
who were born in the U. S. A. Among them are Norma Shixman. Paul Shilman,
Grace Duetch-Ecogay (nee Sgovia) now in Italy, andzany others.

C. At the time of Subject's birth, Subject's father was
employed in the Brooklyn shipyards. However, he changed jobs
frequently and was subsequently employed on a farm near New
Brunswick, then in a shoe factory as a cutter, then as a butcher,
and finally became active in a Jewish cooperative organization.
As Subject's father became convinced that the future of the Jews
was in Russia under Soviet Communism, in 1931 Subject's family
left the USA for the USSR for Birobidzhan where Subject's father
worked as an agronomist (he had sometime prior thereto graduated
from the National Farm School in Bucks County, Pennsylvania).
d. According to Subject, his family returned to the USA
in 1933; the motivating reason therefor was the ill health--
actually only seem headaches--of Dubject's brother, Eugene.
Subject alleges that, because they had retained their US citizen-
ship, they experienced no problems either in leaving the USSR or
in obtaining permission to return to the USA. Moreover, Subject's
father allegedly did not like life in the USSR; however, Subject's
mother and sister insisted that they return to the USSR after
only a brief stay in the USA.
e. As a result, later in 1933 the entire AMRON family once
again returned to the USSR. Again, Subjec states that they had no
problems in obtaining authorization from the Soviet government
for this trip to the USSR. Upon their return to the USSR, they
established themselves in Moscow where one Noah LONDON, a friend
of the family and a construction engineer, took Subject's father
"into his employ". Subject's father worked in this capacity, in
the construction industry, from 1933 to 1936. Sometime after the
1936 purges began, Subject's father worked for Komsomolsk, a Moscov
"panel board construction" outfit. In 1936 Subject's father also
worked for the Paris Commune as a shoemaker. Subject's mother
worked during this entire period as chief of a dining establishment
in the school of foreign languages in Moscow.
Subject began his elementary education at the DeWitt Cliston
School in the USA where he studied until 1931; he then studied in
the Soviet secondary school in Khabarovsk, Birobidzhan, until 1933.
In 1933 he again returned for one semester to the Devitt Clinton
School. Later in 1933 and 1934 be attended the Anglo-American School
in Moscow where be completed his 8th grade of school. He then
continued his studies from 1933 to 1936 in Public School #327 in the 24th
Bauman Rayon. In 1936 he entered the Moscow Avtodorozhniy Institut
where be studied on the civil engineering faculty, to be a highway
engineer. He graduated in 1941 at which time he was sent to assist

Contleman:
In answer to your advertisement in the New York Times
of June 21, 1964 for a Russian linguist capable of translating,
analyzing and editing publications, as well as interpreting,
I am enclosing my resume.
I lived in Russia for over 25 years and graduated
college there after the beginning of the German-hussian var.
After 7 years of continuous attempts to leave Russia, I was
repatriated in September, 1962. I am a native-born citizen of
the United States of America.
In dussia I worked as a translator, editer and head
of Translator's Bureaus for twenty years. My experience in
translating, abstracting and selection of technical articles
for publication is significant. My initial salary requirements
are $10,000 per year. I would appreciate the opportunity of a
personal interview for discussing possibilities which may exist
for me in your organization.
Sincerely yours,

8. In 1937 Subject's mother was dismissed from her position
and both she and Subject's father began to feel the pressure of the

obtained Soviet citizenship. According to subject, he actually

at the time, he was "granted" Soviet citizenship by virtue of his
other's application for her own citizenship.

Subject remained in Moscow prior to World War II. In April
1940 he married
Nina MOISEYIVA
a bookkeeper by profession,
who was the step-daughter of the well-known Major SEOGOLEV of the
"Scriet Proleteriat Regiment". A son was born to them in June 1941.
Although at this time Subject was assigned to the construction of
aerodromes to support front line troops, he succeeded in pulling
strings and in arranging a TEDY trip" to Moscow, ostensibly to visit
the Geodetic Institute. Earcute back from Moscow to the front lines,
Subject's train got bombed in Brest Litovsk on 22 June 1941 and as
a result he was returned to Moscow on the same train via Baranovichi.
According to Subject, he was then assigned to the Moscow Military
District, to the Ctdel Aerodromnoi Sluzhby, where he was placed in
charge of a brigade of engineers, technicians and laborers who vere
engaged in building dummy air sites for camouflage purposes.
3. In August 1941 Subject states that he was permitted to return
to school in order to receive his diploma which was granted him in
October 1941. He was then assigned to the 22nd Voyenno-Dorozhaiy

During the years I spent in the Soviet Union had many friends.
Among them were writers, journalists, engineers, doctors and professionals
in different fields. It would be very difficult to list all of them. For
instance, during the last year I met a new neighbour in the building I moved
into. He was a professor in the field of economics. His name was Ears and
he told me many things which I never knew about concerning the econimic
basis of the Soviet s stem. He noted that with an industrial labour force
exceeding the labour force of the 3. S. A. by 100 the productivity of
labour and industrial production vasthree times lower.

While studying in high school - became acquainted with a well-known

finishing as a Jr. Lt. was in active dity as a platoon officer. I was
wounded Cet. 11, 1943. I was operated upon three times, the last time in
April, 1945. After being discharged from the Soviet Army due to combat dis-
ability I got a job as a senior librarian in the Technical Library of the

Killed, in 12, during WW II. Her maiden name, by her stepfather was
Shchegolyeva. My second wife (maiden name Volsova) was a pathologist.
She hid the fact that she could not have children and we were divorced one
month after my mariage. In 1952 I met Rose Mirkina. We vere officially
married only a few months hefire cur son was born. The cause of this delay
in our marriage was the fact that I wasborn in the United States. Her brother
is an aviation engineer and her brother-in-law works in the field of elec-
tronics. Her other considered that our marriage would harn my wife's re-
latives. In 1915, after the birth of our son we began handing in applice-
tions for a visa from the Soviet Government. At first we tried to
get out as visitors to my parents. We received our first refusal at the
time of the Ungarian Revolt. Up till 1957, when my father came to visit us
we continued to hand in applications for an ex't risa as visitors. After
1957 we continued to hand in applications approximately every six months
to leave the Soviet Union permanently. And we continued to regularly near
- refusals. I consider that the agravations connected with these refusals
contributed to the causes of my wife's death in March, 1961. Andonly, in
July, 1962 on and I received exit visas. As I mentioned in Form 444 I
filled in two different applications. The first answer to the applications
I filled out in the U. S. Embassy in Moscow: as an in igrant and as a native-
born citizen was a Nonqusta imigrant visa. The Board of Appeals:f the
Dept. of State, after my arrival, restored my native-born citizenship.
In 1955, due to a reduction of forces I lost my staff job in the
Baunan kad pair Dent. At this time I was working as a free-lance
translat in the U.S.S.R. Chamber of Commerce and as a part-time trans-
later in Hydcenerzproject. Until January of 1956 I worked for these
organizatiors. In 1956 I began working as the Head of the Translators Dept.

Bauman load pair Dept. At this time I was working as a free-lance
translat r in the U.S.S.R. Chamber of Commerce and as a part-time trans-
later in Hydscenergoproject. Until January of 1956 I worked for these
organizations. In 1956 I began working as the Head of the Translators Dept.
of the Scientific-Research Institute of Construction and Road-Building
Machinery. After having finished the translation of all manuals in this
field i continued working until I left the Soviet Union as a free-lance
translater and editor for the Chamber of Commerce, the Freign Trade….
Publishing House, the Foreign Languages Publishing House, Hydr- energeproject
and other organizations requiring translators.
·
After returning to the U. S. A. I got a job as a civil engineer. At
first I vorred for Stelling, Lord-Wood and Van Suetondal from Nov., 1962
to Dec. 19-2 and then from January, 1963 to July, 1904 I worked for
Blauvelt Engineering Co. At resent an virking for Harold J. Seldin,
60 Bread St., Red Bank, New Jersey. During the last several months I have
been working an a free-lance basis with AEREACHI Corporation (1634 Arch St.,
Philadelphia, Pa.) as an abstract-r.

because, as a member of the MD, this was considered as equivalent
to military service. Nonetheless, in response to my query, Subject
admitted that this was unusual as his activities were of a kind which
vere performed by old women particularly since during this period,
from October 1941 to September 1942, all able-bodied Soviet males
were drafted into the Soviet army. During this period Subject lived
in comparative ease, being assigned to Suzdal and Klin, and other
towns, According to subject, be wore an MD uniform but wore no
insignia. He admitted that "favored treatment" was bestowed upon
him and his family when the MD assisted him in evacuating his first
wife and son from Moscow in August 1941 to beyond the Urals. (His
son by his first wife reportedly died on 11 October 1943 of diabetes.)

k. In September 1942, Subject received an appointment to the
Moscow 2nd Military Infantry Institute from which he graduated in June
1043
which be the firm the grade of in the Soviet
Jr
Infantry. In response to my query, Subject again admitted that this
appointment was highly unusual as his background did not lend itself
to this, as appointments were made out of the various military
branches, and as this implied that, as a foreigner (American), he was
fully and completel; trusted by the Soviet punitive organs who had
cleared him both for this training and the institute and for promotion
to officer status in the Soviet Army.

1. Initially be was sent to Alater on the Volga, then to Orel
where he was assigned to the front lines in August 1943. He was given a
platoon of infantry troops in the 415th Infantry Division of the
Soviet Central Front. However, in October 1943 he was wounded; he was
hit in the left forehead by e German bullet. Ee was operated on in
a field hospital and then transferred to a Moscow hospital after he
had recovered sufficiently. He was reclassified after his recovery
and found suitable to continue in military service wita the limitation
that he should not serve on the front lines (goden vtoroi stepeni).
Because the wound failed to heal completely (he has & very
obvious scar, with approximately a 1" depression, on his forehead), ·
he "asked" to be assigned to a varmer clizate. The Soviet authorities,
he states, complied and in January 1944 dispatched him to Tbilisi
where be was placed in a special officer's camp; he was hospitalized
again, tad osteomyelitis complications, and ultimately discharged from
the Soviet military forces. Exvever, Subject provided several
contradictory stories as to the date of discharge which at various
times he indicated occurred in May 1944, then in July 19th, and even
in August 1944. (NOTE: This aspect of Subject's story bothered hi
as it was obvious to the undersigned that Subject had somewhere become
confused in this aspect of his background.)

Upon his discharge, be vas returned to the Moscow area where
he was placed in a rest hot (although Subject admitted that there
really existed no need for this as he had recovered already prior
to his discharge). In continuing his narration, Subject indicated
that the rest of his story "sounds very strange and unbelievable"
but then averred that it was true. He states that, strange as it
appears and despite the shortage of Soviet men at the time (1944)
be could not "find" himself a job. He went to the MYD which did
offer hin a job in Veliki Luki on the highways with the ScyuzDorog-
Proyekt ; however, he was not given the job by the officials
responsible for this. As a result, he appealed directly to the
Minister of the HVD who "tried to intercede" in Subject's behalf.
Allegedly after he was given a full physical examination, be vas told
that he could not be assigned to the highway units for reasons
which were not spelled out to Subject.
o. Subject then "sought out" work with the Nauchniy Sovet with
no luck. He ultimately obtained a job with the Moscow Sovet in the
Moscow Soviet Senior Library (sic). In November 1944, at a salary
of 900 rubles, Subject began working in the field of "information
on municipal works-highway construction, architecture, sanitation,
etc. Eis immediate supervisor vas (Thu) LEEDEV, the bead of
information department of the Bydro-Energy Project. Subject admitted,
in reply to the undersigned's query, that his work was "unusual”
for several reasons. First, he was paid a salary which was unusually.
high and out of line with his qualifications. Secondly, though
paíů a salary for a full-time job and position, he actually worked on
a part-time basis and was able to come and go almost as he vished.
His work also included working on abstracts and translations from
English to Russian, primarily in the field of dams, dam construction,
and hydraulics.
P. In June 1949 Subject states that be was dismissed from the
foregoing position after he was given the explanation that the flow of
literature from the USA, which Subject was translating, had decreased.
In actual fact, Subject states, he was being "purged" because he vas
a Jev. He then found a job as a laboratory assistant in a concrete
plant where he worked from July 1949 to 23 February 1950. Because
he did not like that job, Subject states he wrote to Stalin personally
as a result of which, within less than 4 weeks, he was offered 4-5
different jobs. The positions were offered to him by the Moscow
Committee of the CP to whom "Stalin had forwarded the letter". In
reply to my query, Subject admitted that he was not concerned that,
by writing to Stalin, be would come to the attention of the Soviet
punitive organs, MVD/MGB, which would undertake to investigate his
case. Accordingly, on 1 April 1950 Subject was given a job as an

engineer with the Bemman District Road Department where he worked
until February 1955.
After he lost his job in 1949 with the Moscow Sovet, he states
that his relations with his wife went from bad to worse and ultimately
cultinated first in a separation and latter in a divorce in 1950.

the meantime, he was already living with

Institute where she was studying for her PhD and where she was
working in a forge as a pathologist. fetamfed how of thow d
1950 or 1952. However, within less than one month of their marriage,
Subject divorced her as he found out that she was a "tad person" and
because he "had fallen blindly in love" with her. (5015: This aspect
(KOTE:
of Subject's story disturbed him very much. He was unsure of himsel",
was vague on dates, details, specifics, names, etc. It was again
obvious that Subject was less than frank and open about this aspect
of his beckground. His narration did not sound convincing to Subject
himself when he began talking about "falling blindly in Love", etc.)
In 1952 he began living with another woman,
Rose MINKINA,
whom he married only in late 1954 when their son was already well on
the way. MIRKIRA's parents and family were very strongly opposed to
the marriage because the parents held responsible party positions and
because MINKIRA's brother held a sensitive position with the Soviet
electronics and aviation industries. A son vas born to Subject and
MEIKINA on 5 April 1955.
I. In ca 1954 (dates vague) Subject entered the Institute of
Marxism-Leninism and continued his studies for three or more years.
Though he registered for the evening sessions, he devoted a good
portion of his days to study. As a result, Subject again admitted
to the undersigned that he actually was in a unique position of being
able to do almost as be "Wished and desired" although ostensibly be
was a full-time employee of the Bauman District Road Department. While
a student at the Institute of Marxist-Leninism, Subject and his wife
began submitting applications for a visa to visit Subject's parents
in the USA. In actual fact, Subject states, his real purpose in
applying for the visa vas to defect" upon his arrival in the USA.
In February 1955 Subject states that he was fired" from his job
However,
with the Bauman District because of "political unreliability".
Subject admitted to the undersigned that the real reason for dismissal

must
have been otherwise as, had be actually been dismissed for
"political unreliability", he would not have been able to continue
his studies at the Institute of Marxism-Leninism.
8. Because Subject had communicated to his father, using
"hidden phrases" in their letters to each other, about his wish to
leave the USER, Subject's father arrived in the USSR in 1957 in
order, Subject states, "to establish at first hand for himsel"
whether Subject really wished to "defect to the USA". Subject's
father remained in the USSR for a total of 10 days. As a result
of his father's visit, Subject changed his tactics and began to
submit applications for "imigation" to the USA. As earlier, these :
lation to rejected; over, Subject states that he
continued resubmitting then several times each year.
t. After be left the Bauman District place of employment in
February 1955, Subject found work as a "free lance translator for
the Moscow Torgovaya Palata. He earned ca 100 rubles per onth
translating English language material related to the iron and steel
plant which was being designed by the USSP for erection in India.
In January 1956 Subject found work as chief of the translations
bureau of the Nauchno-Issledovely Institut Ministerstva Mashizo-
Stroyeniya; his functions consisted primarily of supervising the
translation of English language manuals on technical equipment.
Again, Sibject admitted that his work was "umnsual" as, in actual
fact, he spent 1-2 days at work, spent the rest of his time at home,
and devoted most of his time and energy to the studies at the
Institute of Marxism-Leninism. His salary continued at 1100 rubles
per month.

stated that the position had been eliminated but then changed this
story to state that he resigned in August 1956 as he would have had
to begin devoting his full time to the work. In any case, his
resignation generally coincided with his completion of studies at
the Institute of Marxism-Leninism. Thereafter, and until his
immigration to the USA in 1962, Subject held no full time job.
Konetheless, he states that be succeeded in earning no less than
about 11.00 rubles per month by working as a free lance translator
for the Torgovaya Palata of Moscov. He turned over to the undersigned
a sample of his translation efforts--see the attached bocs. In
response to my query, Subject admitted that his work again was of
such a nature that he was a free agent, came and went as he pleased,
and generally was responsible to no one. Apparently in order to

forestall any further discussions in this regard, Subject then
stated that "if you are thinking that I could have worked for the
KGB at this time, then you are right because I had the tire to
do anything including engaging in intelligence activities.
However, Subject then proceeded to deny that he had then or at any
time, had any relationship with the KGB (or its predecessor
