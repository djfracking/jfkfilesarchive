MEMORANDUM FOR; Deputy Director for Science & Technology
}
SUBJECT
1.
TSD Support to Other Agencies
Technical Services Division's charter (CSI 1-8) requires
that it provide technical assistance to both CIA operations and
other activities as may be directed by the Deputy Director for
Operations.
2. Over the years the chief non-CIA recipients of this
support have been the Department of Defense, the Federal .
Bureau of Investigation, Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous
Drugs, Immigration and Naturalization Service, Department
of State, United States Postal Service, Secret Service, Agency
for International Development, and the White House.
98
3. While varying widely among the different recipients, these
services have included training and materials, and in a few in-
stances participation in the fields of audio and visual surveillance,
secret writing and related communications, personal protection,
alias documentation and questioned document examination, disguise,
concealment devices, electronic beaconry, illicit narcotics detec-
tion, and counter-sabotage/terrorism.]
98.
4. In most instances requirements for this support are
'received by TSD through higher echelons (Office of the Director
or Deputy Director for Operations). Unless the service involved
is a trivial or continuing one, the request is referred to the
Foreign Intelligence Staff Departmental Coordination Group for
coordination and approval at the appropriate Agency levels.
Approval within TSD by the Chief of Operations or Development
and Engineering and the Chief of TSD or his Deputy also is re- :
quired.
5. The attachment lists the primary services provided to
the organizations named in Paragraph two.

6. Gran
pannnce of forged personal identity documentation by
ASD is controlled according to two broad criteria: type of
requester; and type of documentation requested. A request
for denied area documentation from a DDO Area Division is
honored after proper validation. Free world documentation
may require some extra coordination however. A Swiss
passport would not be issued without coordination with the EUR
Swiss Branch; an Irish passport would not be issued for use
anywhere in the Commonwealth area without the approval of
the British Desk; Hong Kong documentation is not to be used in
Hong Kong unless approved by Hong Kong Chief of Station.]
7. Unless ordered otherwise by higher Agency authority,
no U.S. documentation is issued by TSD Headquarters without
prior coordination with the Office of Security and the Central
Cover Staff. TSD Regional Bases require at least the valida-
tion of U.S. documentation requests by the COS, or his
designated representative, of the requesting Station. Because
it could be used in order to obtain a U. S. passport in alias, no
U.S. Birth Certificate is issued without approval of the DDO 24
via Central Cover Staff. Backstopped major credit cards are
issued by Office of Security, not TSD.
24
8. Provision of forged documentation to non-DDO requesters,
whether they be CIA or other Agency requesters, always requires
approval of non-TSD offices. Support to the military for instance
would be validated by FI Staff/Departmental Coordination Group
at Headquarters or by the COS overseas having responsibility for
98 coordination of the operation. BNDD requests are coordinated
# with DDO/NARCOG. Requests for documentation of Immigration
and Naturalization Service is coordinated via the Alien Affairs
98
Staff.]

9. Authentication items are issued on a loan basis and must
be returned to TSD or accounted for. After any documentation has
been issued, TSD retains photographs and records of such support
until the documentation has been returned to TSD. If the material
is not returned after a reasonable time, the requester is reminded
of the outstanding documentation.]
