1. Pursuant to the verbal statements of Dennis K. COPELAND at the Lima Confer-
ence of certain Station Chiefs, pertaining to ZACACTUS Operations in Chile,
the following suggestions are advanced for Headquarters' consideration:
a) Cover for Chile, Official:
The Air Attache, Col. William ROSS, talked at length with General ACKERMAN,
Assistant A-2, AFGS, while attending the Panama Service Attache Conference,
on the question of providing a replacement for the Air Officer who had
originally been scheduled for Santiago Air Attache Office to handle ZACACTUS.
ROSS, who is a very intelligent, capable officer, with excellent intelli-
gence experience, told ACKERMAN that he would appreciate being considered
for this assignment in addition to his regular duties, as he was keenly
interested in this type of endeavor. He was of the opinion that he could
devote as large a share of his time to this work as would any other officer
so assigned to his office. Furthermore, due to the size of his staff,
three officers, he felt he could assign the bulk of his Air duties to his
assistants and concentrate his efforts on ZACACTUS matters, which he thought
were of greater importance in Chile. General ACKERMAN, according to ROSS,
was not adverse to this proposal but stated he would await contact from
ZACACTUS Headquarters before considering the matter further.
This Station has high regard for ROSS and is of the opinion that he would
apply himself in a very diligent and intelligent manner to the duties of
handling ZACACTUS in Chile. He is fully aware of the necessity for discre-
tion, as he had been briefed on this at the time the former ZACACTUS candi-
date had been considered for the Air Attache Office.
b) Covert field covers RESTRICTED TO WH/1/chile.
FORM
This Station highly recommends: Headquarters consideration of FULMINATER÷1
as the principal ZACACTUS operator in Chile on a permanent basis. This
person is well known to this Station and has demonstrated his ability in
handling FULMINATER-2 and the publication of the posters/stickers for the
SAR 451-28 A :

officer for ZACACTUS in Chile and that he maintain the official files,
funds and communications with ZACACTUS Headquarters.
2) ZACACTUS Field Operator: It is suggested that FULMINATER-1 be employed
on a regular State-side salary basis and that he be authorized a small
staff to assist him in the actual handling of all field projects. He
should have one officer assistant in a covert capacity and two stenog-
raphers, all of whom would be in his overt cover office, presumably as
his regular employees.
3) Cut-outs, agents, etc.: FULMINATER-1 should be authorized to develop
such out-outs, agents, etc. as required to carry out his objectives in
Chile.
1
2. This Station is of the opinion that with the exception of possibly Mexico and
Venezuela, Chile is one of the most important Pa targets in Latin America.
The Communist influence in Chile is unquestionably a serious political factor,.
and their propaganda is growing steadily throughout the country with extremely
little if any opposition. The present Communist drive towards nationalization
of the copper industry is gaining adherents daily and should be considered a.
potentially serious matter from the standpoint of our reliance on Chilean.
copper. Thus, it is the view of this Station that PW work is important in
Chile and that its initiation on a larger scale should not be unduly delayed.
It is also believed that considerable time, effort and money would be saved by
utilising the talent now in Chile, such as ROSS and FULMINATER-1, who already
have their feet on the ground and are ready to start.
3. In the case of ROSS, if Headquarters is interested, it should approach General
ACKERMAN direct in A-2. Regarding FULMINATER-1, a very tentative approach
has been made to sound him out, and he reacted very favorably although no
commitments were made as to salary or exact nature of the work. The moment for
a décision in his case is very opportune, as he is planning to sell his news-
paper and leave Chile for the United States or some other country. Recogniz-
ing the value his paper and presses would have to his cover and his work, he Hub
was asked, ás mentioned above, to postpone selling his paper for thirty days.
It is believed that he would be an excellent person for ZACACTUS in Chile and
for future, consideration as a Staff Officer. It is not believed that he would
be interested in any salary less than $5,000 per year although again, this
subject has not been discussed with him to date. It is urged, however, that
Headquarters cable this Station as early as practicable if there is any interest
in obtaining FULMINATER-1 as proposed above.

UN-ECOSOC propaganda effort. His assets are generally as follows:
1) Cover: He is publisher and editor of a fairly successful weekly news-
paper in Child Although he is at the moment considering the possibility
of selling this newspaper, he has been encouraged to defer such action
for thirty days pending Headquarters' decision on his case.
This paper
has its own printing presses and is capable of handling large printing
"orders of all types. This activity could be regulated in such a manner
that it would only require a minimum amount of FULMINATER-1's time and
would provide him with an excellent cover for his ZACACTUS activities.
2) Ability: Ho is a writer, playwrite, publisher and editor. Those
qualifications plus his initiative, imaginativeness, ingenuity and broad
orge,
background
should qualify him for ZACACTUS opazi,
of course, has an excellent command of Spanish as well as French and
German.
¨ 3) Contacts: Due to his professional status in Chile, he is on excellent
personal terms with all other newspaper publishers, correspondents and
editors. He also conducts a radio program and is accordingly well in-
formed in this field and has many radio contacts. In view of the fact
he originally published his newspaper in Valparaiso, he has many contacts
on the coast as well which should be important in this work.
4.) Personality: He is considered exceptional both in appearance and per❤
sonality and has easily acquired the confidence and friendship of
• Chileans and Americans alike. Due to his wide interests, he is con-
sidered very well informed and cultured. His demeanor is always that of
a gentleman, yet he is capable of courageous action as evidenged by his
war experience and his conduct of assignments for this Station as indicated
below.
§) Intelligence experience: He was originally approved operationally to
handle the complex Soviet espionage case of FULMINATER-2. His conduct
of this case was considered excellent, and he displayed resourcefulness,
tact and ability to handle himself in difficult circumstances.
During the LCACTING operations of this Station involving the printing
of the posters, stickers, handbills and the "Communist Pig", this Station
called on FULMINATER-1 to do the job. It will be recalled that Head-
quarters was very pleased with the printing job in this project which
FULMINATER-1 had done. This particular project revealed FULMINATER-1'☎
ability to handle ZACACTUS work effectively and with discretion as borne
out by the fact that the local Communists were never able to trace the
origin of this material.

Attached art a) statement of termination signed by subject

Paul D. LANGEVIN may be used for recruiting tasks before his
permanent departure from Chile in April 1954. His security
is not questioned and he has expressed a willingness to per-
form such tasks..
3. He also requests arrangements for the payment of income tax
on his earnings ouring 1953. This matter will be handled
by cable in view of time element.

t
The following explains the timing of LANGEVIN's termination:
he had been advised that he would be terminated one month
after all advances had been liquidaten. This would have
been 30 September 1953. This date was also chosen since
it was expected that COMENIUS would take over FURIOSO "C"
at about that time. COK NIUS did take over the project.
early in October. However, LANGEVIN did no work during th
month of September for which he would be entitled to pay-
ment, althoug: he cresumably was available for duty. The
last payment of 337.4 for the period 1 through 31 August
195 was in addition to the liquidation of his avances
althoug it did not cover a full month from the cate-of
such liquidat on which must have occuried sometime in August.
LANGEVIN accepted this as the st payment coming to him so
theie id not seem to be any oint i forcing another $500
on hit for a period during which he did no work.

SUBJECT: Future Resignation from CIA of David Phillips
1. In a recent meeting with the Chief of Station, David Phillips, the
PECTATE case officer, 'informally announced his intention of resigning from
CIA in the near future. At that time Phillips requested that Headquarters
be informed by the Chief of Station. The decision to resign has been made
informally, in order for the Station and Headquarters to have as much ad-
vance notice as possible. Actually, Phillips does not expect to leave his
Beirut assignment for about four months, or sometime in the month of July.
Phillips reports that the PECTATE building will have been finished and oc-
cupied by PECTATE staffers long before that time.
2. In the above-mentioned meeting, and in a Memorandum for the Record
submitted to the Chief of Station, Phillips has emphasized that his decision
was reached after careful though and has been prompted solely by personal
considerations. Specifically the reasons are:
8.
The necessity of Phillips' return to Latin America to take
care of personal business problems, mainly the sale of his newspaper
in Chile. He has been negotiating for this sale for many months,
but he feels that an advantageous agreement would be impossible to
reach by mail from such a distance.
b. Phillips' desire to inaugurate a business firm in Cuba.
3. The Chier of Station has discussed this matter with Phillips in
detail. Phillips has reiterated--and has requested that Headquarters be so
advised--that his decision is purely personal. There is no question of dis-
satisfaction with CIA, or of a morale problem.
or of a morale problem. On the contrary, Phillips
has expressed his regret that circumstances prompt him to terminate what
he has described as a most rewarding association with CIA.
4. Phillips' plans for leaving the Beirut assignment bring up the
problem of future CIA control of PECTATE. Phillips has submitted to the
Chief of Station his personal recommendations on this score, which have been
considered in preparing a separate dispatch.

disturbed because of the newspaper being owned by an American. Recently
the Ambassador called in the local editor of the newspaper and asked for
an explanation. He replied that he was himself in complete accord with
the Klein-Saks program but that his hands were tied as he was acting upon
instructions from his publisher. Personally, I think that that was
probably not true but was simply a means of passing the buck to extricate
himself from a difficult situation. I do not believe that Phillips is
very much "au courant" with the activities of the newspaper and that its
policy is left pretty much in the hands of the local editor. Unfortunately,
the Air Attache, who has been here for a considerable period, mentioned
to the Ambassador that he thought I might be able to throw some light on
the situation due to the fact that he, himself, knew that Phillips had.

the most circumspect thing that could te done would be to apprise Phillips
of what is going on on his newspaper, so that he could correct the situa-
tion if he so desires. I understand the Ambassador intends to write a
very strong letter directly to Phillips. A strong statement in reply
could very well avoid embarrassment at a future date for KUBARK.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, WH Division
SUBJECT
: Mr. David A. Phillips
1. The attached dispatch from the Chief of Station, Beirut,
covers the proposed resignation of Mr. David A. Phillips from
CIA. The matter was discussed with the Chief of Station during
his recent visit to Headquarters, and he feels that Mr. Phillips'
decision to return to South America is irrevocable.
2. Mr. Phillips, as you are aware, was in Havana until the
spring of 1957, at which time he accepted a staff agent position
in Beirut. His primary responsibility was the establishment of
a radio and television production center in addition to providing
a mriety of covert programs in the psychological field. Mr. Phil-
lips was instrumental in the establishment of a clandestine radio
broadcasting station in the area in addition to the more direct
responsibilities of his Beirut assignment.
3. The Chief of Station indicated that Mr. Phillips did a
highly commendable job while in Beirut and feels his departure
from the Middle East is regrettable; however, he was unable to
dissuade Mr. Phillips from his desires to leave CIA. Headquarters
has been equally impressed by Mr. Phillips' services and feels
he performed in an exemplary manner, utilizing his mature judgment
and excellent PP sense in attaining the objectives which led to
his assignment in Beirut.
