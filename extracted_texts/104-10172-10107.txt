When the letters were received by PERRY, Sr. and GOMEZ, both noting the
error, they exchanged letters. However, GOMEZ considered the contents of
the letter he had at first received important enough to turn over to his
brother H. Leal GOMEZ, who in turn referred it to the Boston Office of
the FBI.
The letter, in substance, indicated that while PERRY was serving in
South America, under cover for this Americy, he had revealed his true status
to his wife's father, Mr CONSALVES, on a visit to South America, and who
later had revealed this information to PERRY's father.
