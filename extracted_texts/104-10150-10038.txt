Summary of Initial Missions
In the period from 20 June to 10 July 1956 the Soviet Bloc air defense
system was subjected to eight penetrations of an unprecedented nature, seyen
occurning within a period of only eight days. It must be remembered that
24 COMINE provides the only basis of judging the performance of the Soviet
system. This is important because it is clear from REGAL material that 724

These initial flights and these are indicated as follows:
1. In spite of the fact that these missions come as a surprise,
None of them went undetected. This is clear evidence that their
radar coverage extends above (72,000 feet.

7. Confusion and track loss seemed to be related to the 99
presence of large numbers of fighters although the saturation point
has not been determined because of insufficient data.
8. The question of radars for height finding, the capabilities
of TOKEN in this role, the introduction of ROCK CAKES and later
developments are discussed in another section. It is believed,
however, that these missions were a catalyst in the introduction
of ROCK CAKES.

2. By 5 July 1956, the fourth flight, the USSR was aware
of the purpose of the missions and were taking counter action.
One positive action was the standdown of civil flights while the
mission aircraft was over the USSR, and a second action which is
believed related is the moving of MIG-19 aircraft into East
Germany and Poland on 7 July 1956. Also MIG-19's were moved
into Hungary at about this time.

is not clear an explanation which appears to fit the known facts
As a result of the previous missions, the
is offered as follows:
Soviets had concluded the essential facts concerning the missions,
i.e., that they were for reconnaissance, that they flew above
feet, and that a penetration as deep as Moscow was possible. They
probably surmised that the 5 July mission was headed for Moscow when
the track appeared on a northeasterly heading. The loss of the
target when it entered Soviet territory was probably deliberate and
the "red herring" track returning to the west was either a dodge
or a convenience to avoid broadcasting a track for all the system
to see that a "hostile or intruder" was coming over Moscow with no

appear was only by Moscow and it has been suggested that other
stations had been instructed not to broadcast the track. Further, it may
or may not be a coincidence that the height broadcast was almost
exactly half of the true altitude of the mission aircraft, but on
the next missions, four days later, the altitude reporting was
consistently above 50,000 feet.
4. By 9 July 1956, in addition to the evident recognition of
the great height of the mission flights, tracking was better and
in general the performance of the warning system was much improved.

5. The next day, 10 July 1956, the Soviet air defense warning
system closed a 3000 mile track with only two short periods of
confusion or track loss. Altitude reporting was over 60,000 feet
