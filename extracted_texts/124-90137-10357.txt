possible intelligence involvement. During the interrogation,
SCHOTT provided the following information concerning Subject:
SCHOTT first became acquainted with Subject in 1940 when he
resided in Subject's home in Germany. Subject, who had moved
to Poland, wrote to SCHOTT in 1957 and asked him to buy used
cars and ship them to him. Subject transmitted to SCHOTT
dollars and dollar checks for purchasing the cars via an

the money on the black market and from exhibitors at the Poznan
