MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
FROM : Chief; SB/2 Desk
24
SUBJECT: COVER, (NONOFFICIAL) - GENERAL
1.
(Proposal for A&E Assessment of Potential
REDSKIN
#90582 SKIN Agent Candidates)
Reference is made to my previous memorandum pertaining
to the proposal to initiate a change of policy with respect to
the processing of potential REDSKIN Agents.
2. As will be noted, it was initially recommended that
potential REDSKIN Agent candidates be provided with an A&E assess-
ment by OTR prior to disclosure of Agency interest in them and
prior to the disclosure of any classified information. This
assessment will be conducted utilizing a (nonofficial cover) > It
was initially suggested that TSD's Psychological Assessment
Associates firm now used by Dr. GITTINGER be used for this purpose.
If the A&E assessment we're favorable, Security would be requested
to conduct a full investigation of the Subject and he would be
subsequently contacted under alias CIA credentials. At that point,
he would be requested to perform a mission for us and would be
given requirements for same if he agreed to accept such assignment.
3. Attention is invited to the attached memorandum dated
8 February 1961. A copy of this memorandum was furnished to
the writer with the verbal request that credit checks be conducted
on all the staff A&E members mentioned. Prior to the initiation
of credit checks, it was verbally agreed between the undersigned and
Mr. Thomas STRANGE, CCG/NC, that no credit check would be conducted
on Jacob GOLDER, in view of the fact that it was known the latter
was recently surfaced as an Agency employee. The requested credit
checks were completed on or about 16 February 1961 and the results 20
verbally transmitted to Mr. Thomas STRANGE.

4. As of this date, CCG feels that they may have to establish
another notional cover for this program. It is understood that
this cover will be utilized in addition to utilizing the Psychological 24
Assessment Associates. Pending a further request in this matter
from CCG, no further action is contemplated.
