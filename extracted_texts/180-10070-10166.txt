December 8, 1995
Status of Document: Postponed in Part
Number of releases of previously postponed information: 7
Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors
including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the
absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United
States or to any individual.
Number of Postponements: 2
Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.
Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could
reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of
privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

MEMORANDUM
TO: TOM LAMBETH
FROM: KENNETH D. KLEIN
DATE: JUNE 16, 1977
RE:
BILL TRIPLETT
OFF
It is my recommendation that Bill Triplett
be hired as a staff counsel. I interviewed
him approximately 5 months ago and he is far
superior to almost all of the applicants I have
interviewed. His legal background is excellent
for our purposes. He has experience as a pro-
secutor, a defense lawyer and as an investigator.
He impressed me as being intelligent, well spoken
and as having an easy going manner.
He desires to leave his present position with LEAA
due to the lack of challenge. I am certain that
this Committee would be gaining a productive member
by hiring Mr. Triplett.
