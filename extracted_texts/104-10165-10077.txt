INCLUSIVE DATES OF FILE MATERIAL Undated THRU APRIL 1978
RELEVANCE OR NON-RELEVANCE TO OSWALD & JFK ASSASSINATION:
Neither the information or time frame is relevant. See Summary below.
REASON OR ASSUMED REASON FOR INCLUSION IN THIS COLLECTION.
A review of the HSCA volumes did not surface an "Abram" Chayes but an "Abraham" Chayes, a legal
advisor to the State Department, who maintained that at the time Oswald received his visa to enter Russia
from the Soviet Embassy in Helsinik, normally at least 1 week would elapse between the time of a tourist's
application and the issuance of a vias. It would appear that Abram and Abraham are not identical to each
other. Betty Lichtenfeld of the HSCA reviewed the file on 17 August 1978.
SUMMARY OF INFORMATION WITHIN FILE:
Harvard Law School professor who attended a Pugwash Conference in Munich in 1977.
CIA/U. S. GOVERNMENT RELATIONSHIP:
None.

1. Enclosed you will find a list of attendees (Enclosure A)
to the Pageash Conference held in mich, Germany, in August, and
a set of questions (Enclosure E) prepared by the ORPA analysts
at our request. Since the original list of attendees contained
only the last name and first initial of each US participant, we
had to make some educated guesses as to the true identities of
many of them.
As a result, do not be surprised if some question
why we felt they had attended. In many cases, however, there was
no question as to the true identity of the source.
2. ORPA has been quite pleased with the reporting generated
by their previous requirements. As a result, they have race an
extra effort to write even more thought provoking requirements.
We feel that the enclosed questions are the best we have sent out
to date.
3. Responsive reporting should cite the current CIRL, Objective
Ala and KIQ 90. We look forward to receiving your responses.
