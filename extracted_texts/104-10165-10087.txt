then BENTLEY first became avare of 20 he was in South America on a mission for
the Treasury Dept., but during all but two months while he was away he was in touch
with the SILVERCASTERS. He commicated directly with the SILVEMASTERS, sending them

BENTLEY believes that JOE also gave the info to "arry Dexter WIE and that this
info was eventually furnished WHITE to the SILV-EASTERS.
BENTLEY in 1945 could not definitely recall having seen any material which could
be identified as definitely originating with COE, but she does state that the info
supplied by him was made available for transmittal to SHLEY's superiors.

It contains approximately 25 rooms with two large courtyards. The

HATICEAL AFFAIRS
After Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution in 1927. she firmly upheld Dr. Sun Yat-sen's
three great pelicies of alliance with Russia, co-operation with the Communist Party and
assistance to the peasants and workers. resolutely resigned all ner pests in the reac-
tionary Kuomintang government, openly exposed the reactionary features of Chiang Kai-shek
and waged an uncompromising struggle. During the war of resistance against Japanese
aggression, she actively responded to the call issued by the Chinese Communist Party
for (a) national united front against Japan and resolutely opposed Chiang Kai-shek's
reactionary policy of passive resistance against Japan and active opposition to the
Communist Party, and of false democracy and real dictatorship. She took an active
part in the anti-Japanese democratic movement. After the southern Anhwei incident of
January 1941, she sternly condemned Chiang Kai-shek's criminal plot to launch a civil war
and waged unremitting struggle to persist in resistance and cppose capitulation, persist
in unity and oppose a split and persist in progress and oppose retrogression. During
the period of the liberation war, she was indignant at Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary
policy of national betrayal, dictatorship and civil war; she actively called on and
organized the democratic forces in the Kucmintang to oppose Chiang Kai-shek, organized
the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, responded to the May 1, 1948 call of
the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party for the convening of the new
Political Consultative Conference, and contributed to China's new demceratic revolution.
"After nation-wide liberation, Madame Ho Hsiang-ning became member of the Council of
the Central People's Goverment, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference, chairman of the Commission of Overseas
Chinese Affairs and chairman of the Union of Chinese Artists. She consistently supported
the leaders ip of the Chinese Communist Party and teck the socialist read. In the
struggle against foreign and domestic enemies, she stood firmly and showed a clear
distinction of whom to itre and whom to hate. Particularly, in the struggle against the
rightists in 1957. she sternly condemned the anti-party and anti-sccialist fallacies of
the bourgetis rightists. She warmly praised the great sccialist motherland, often through
her poems and paintings. She paid great attention to affairs of state, supported the
Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and worked energetically and consistently in
defence of the territorial integrity of the socialist Ectherland and for the liberation
Taiwan.
"Madame Ho Esiang-ning was a revolutionary comrade-in-arms of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the
revolutionary companion of Mr. Liao Chung-kai, a close friend of the Chinese Communist
Party and an outstanding representative of the Kuomintang revolutionaries. She varmly
loved the netherland, the socialist system, the Chinese Communist Party and the great
leader Chairman Mao. Fadame Ho Hsiang-ning remained a revolutionary and a fighter all
ber life.
We deeply mourn over the death of Vice-Chairman Ho Esiang-ning. Let us turn cur
sorrow into strength. and, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, closely
follow the great leader Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and unite to win still
greater victories!'

He praised the heroic Cuban people for the tremenicus victories they won under the
leadership of Prime Minister Pidel Castro in oppring U.S. imperialist session,
subversion and interference, defeating national independence and state sovereignty
and building up their motherland.

He said: This year U.S. Imperialism unreasonably detained Cuban fishing boats and
fishermen on the high seas on two occasions and savagely attacked a fishermen's village
in Cuba and killed immocent inhabitants there, committing one crine after another
gainst the Cuban people. The Cuban navy recently captured two pizate ships which
participated in the counter-revolutionary activities against Cuba. This is an entirely.
Just action. U.S. imperialism has gere so far as to rampantly buff and threaten Cuba
and other Latin American countries and people who are fighting in defense of their 3
national independence and state sovereignty. The Chinese people strongly condern U.S.
imperialism for its criminal activities against Cuban and other Latin American people
and resolutely support the people of Cuba and other Latin American countries in their
Just struggle against U.S. imperialism.
He said the fact that people of all Latin American countries are Joining forces to re-
sist U.S. imperialist aggression and control has become an irresistible historical trend.
Whatever tricks it may resort to. U.S. imperialism can never stop the people of Cuba and
other Latin American countries in their victorious advance.
Anbassador Jesus Barreiro Gonzalez said: "We are very glad to be invited to attend the
gathering this afternoon in commemoration of the 13th anniversary of the victory o2
country's liberation, which is filled with fraternal friendship.
He said that January 1, 1959 was a day of special significance. It marked the success-
ful completion of a stage in the struggle for the liberation of Crta. In a century and
more, the ambassador continued, the Cuban people have resisted attempts at colonialist
and neo-colonialist domination, the basic hallmark being the liberation wars in 1868
and 1895 against the Spanish colonial Joke and the struggle against C.S. imperialisa
which attempted to replace Spain and cecupy the land of Cuba. He said a new stage
began in 1959 after the overthrow of the Batista dictatorial regine which was abetted
by the Dited States.
The anbassador pointed cat that the C.S. imperialist government has continued carrying
out its policies of aggression, sabotage, subversion, blackmail, ecenenic blockade.
invasion and piratical attack agains: Cuba. But all these schemes have met with the
nost ignominious failure.
He said that the restoration to the People's Republic of China of her lawful rights in
the United Nations and the expulsion of the Chiang Kai-shek clique from the UN is a
victory for the people of the world and a failure for the U.S. imperialist government.

"The national liberation novements of the peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America are
continuing to surge forth vigorousij. The revolutionary mass movements of the peoples
of Europe, North America and Ceearda are developing in depth. Countries want inde-
pendence, nations want literation and the people vant revolution--this has become an
irresistible historical trend. The truculent practice of power politics and hegemony
by the superpowers has net with the strong resistance of an increasing number of small
and medium countries; the superpowers are beset with internal and external difficulties
and are having a tougher and tougher time."
The Chinese vice premier said: "In external affairs, our country has firmly carried
out Chairman Kao's proletarian revolutionary line in foreign affairs and won great
victories. The exchange of friendly visits between our people and the people of other
countries, including the American people, is continuously expanding; and the number of
countries which have established diplomatic relations with our country is ever in-
creasing. The vain scheme of the superpowers to blockade and isolate China has gone
totally bankrupt!"
He continued: "The domestic situation of our country is also excellent. Since the
Minth Congress and the Second Plenary Session of the Kinth Central Committee of our
party, the whole party, the whole army and the whole ration, acting on our great leader
Chairman Mao's instruction 'carry out education in ideology and political line', have
unfolded a deep-going moverent for criticizing revisionism and rectifying the style of
Work, further heightened their consciousness of class struggle, the struggle between
the two lines and of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the pro-
letariat, and have won great victories. The struggle-criticism-transformation campaign
of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is continuing to develop in depth. We
have reaped bumper harvests for 10 years running. & new upsurge is emerging in indus-
trial production. Prices are stable and the market [is] flourishing. The revolutionary
spirit of our people is rising higher than ever. Our socialist motherland is prospering
and thriving with each passing day.
Vice Premier Li Hsien-nien wished the experts success in their work and good health.
In conclusion, he said: "Let us work together to better promote the rutual understand-
ing and militant friendship between the Chinese people and the people of other coun-
tires and support and assist the world revolution !"
The banquet proceeded in a warm and friendly atmosphere. Kosts and guests talked
´eordially and proposed toasts to the daily consolidation and development of the revolu-
tionary friendship and militant unity of the people of various countries.
Also attending the banquet were leading members of departments under the CCP Central
Committee, Chinese Goverment departments, the Peking Municipal Revolutionary Committee,

b) What is the medical publication he has received which purports a travel of
American scientists to Mairland êhina?
1
c) Has he found out the nare of that 'Ers. YANG' who first talked about the
travel plans of the American/Chinese engineers?
In reply, STCLOY/1 answered as follows:
a) He can write to Dr. S.C. SUNG, but he does not have a good reason to request
for his visit. Unless there is a medical conference or certain occasion of in-
terest to SUNG, STCLOY/1 feels he can not just supgest SUNG to make a trip to
see him.
b) The medical publication which reports the interest of some American scientists
in the travel to Fainland China is 'Biomedical News' (copy of the news attached).
The II/5-71 issue of the news has published an article written by Harry L. TEX-
NANT entitled 'Scientists Pid For Travel to China', which names Dr. William Mc-
Elroy, director of the National Science Foundation, and Dr. Philip HANDLER, pre-.
sident of the National Academy of Science, as ones who had suggested to make a
trip jointly to China. The article also promotes the cultural exchange of scien-
tists between Mainland China and U.S., and it credits members of two academic
committees for their efforts.
c) The name of that 'Mrs. YANG' is !Mrs. Paul: YANG'. Paul YANG, husband of the
woman who first talked about the travel plan of a group of local Chinese engin-
eers to Mainland China, is an engineering staff of Southern California Edison
Company, Los Angeles, STCLOY/1 does not think that the travel plan as mentioned
by Mrs, YANG has materialized yet. Therefore, there is not much to be found out.
STCLCY/1 showed DEIASCIO two postcards which STGAZER/1 and STREEK/1 had sent him
from Spain. He undertood that STGAZER/1 had returned to Los Angeles a few days ago, and
be is going to meet STGAZER/1 to find out when is he going to Canada to bid for travel
permission to China. STCIOY/1 also agreed to contact Dr. ROSENFELD totheck about their
rovements as well as new activities of HAN Surin. STCLOY/1 believed that HAN might play
an active role in the near future in the Chinese-American relation developments.
40
DELASCIO sought STCLOY/1's assistance to look for a job for TS'AI Yin-Ying (201-
875838), wife of P'AN Har-Sung. STCICY/1 regretted that he could not help because he
does not know directly any hospital laboratory in this area, but he estimated that she
should find a position of Lab Assistant to work under a licensed laboratory technician
of 3 Minital assistant in a physician's office if she persists in trying.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Please make Xerox copies of Biomedical News and forward to HQ as members
of these committees may be good sources to provide us with information about

Will see STCLOY/1 to give him the full address of Dr. SUNG because STCLOY/1
has rislaid it. Then will discuss with him again about what reason he can

scientific quarters seems to have spur-

influx into China of U. S. scientific
specialists of all types. Early indica

China might place the scientist in a
priority position over professions of
other areas, as well as the general
tourist himself.
Meantime, the overall rush was

Medical Progress
Despite a 25-year period of no ex-
change of information between the U.S.
and China, a vast amount of detailed
data has been accumulated, all indi-
cating that China has again stabilized
itself after the turmoil of 1966. Since
1969 over 2,000 types of Chinese tra-
ditional and Western medicines have
KUI TEVULTU us price by an average of
30 per cent. Imports of scientific
equipment and chemicals such
pharmaceuticals, fertilizers and syn-
thetic fibers have dropped because of
China's improving capability to pro-
duce its own instruments, machinery
and chemicals. This accounts in some
measure for the fact that the Depart-
ment of Commerce does not expect a
vast amount of medical goods and
equipment to be exported when and if
the Administration relaxes controls on
movement of non-strategic goods to
China
Western Influence
The Autumn Canton Trade Fair
recently gave some indication of the
trends in China. Among the changes
noted were the 30 per cent increase in
customers and the Chinese favoritism
for West European countries, especially
France and Italy, at Japan's expense.
Exhibits at the fair reflected numerous
technological advances over the pre-
vious year. Among the displays were
silicon-controlled automatic electronic
and punch-tape-controlled tools, meas-
uring and testing instruments, oscillo-
scopes, microscopes, and a wide range
of synthetic plastics, resins and such
basic drugs as antibiotics, sulphur
drugs and vitamins.
The revolution in Chinese education
has produced many schools such as
the Shantung University of Science
and Technology in Tsinan which
opened last October.
Chairman Mao's thinking along
medical lines is responsible for the
"cooperative medical service" intended
to bring medical treatment to all rural
areas. It has been reported that one-
12
third of a million city medical workers
and graduates of medical colleges have
settled in rural areas while 400,000.
others were organized into mobile
medical teams to tend rural areas.
This has prompted shifting of some
hospitals from large metropolitan cen-
ters to the country. The Hailung area,
it is reported, has set up a so-called
"red medical network" designed to en-
abic each production team and factory
to have its own highly publicized
"barefoot doctors.".
In another area all medical school.
graduates have been dispatched to the
countryside and one-half of the medi-
cal workers in Harbin, Tsitshihar,
Mutanchiang and Chiamusze have.
been sent to the rural and mountainous
regions. "In this spirit," the Chinese
say, “they have converted rural homes
to allow for surgical operations."

biomedical, biological, and natural
scientists are eager to survey the scien
tific scene. At the same time it was
pointed out that Dr. William McElroy,
director of the National Science Foun-
dation, and Dr. Philip Handler, presi-
dent of the National Academy of
Sciences, had suggested that they make
a trip jointy to China. This view was
part of the feeling in science quarters
in Washington that an exchange of
scientists between both countries
would be very beneficial to the two
countries even though all sorts of un-
derstanding would have to take place.
This was the reasoning expressed by
President Nixon's science advisor, Dr.
Edward Davis, Jr.
Up to this point there has been
no official Government effort to
initiate exchanges and an early ap-
praisal of this possibility indicates that
funds would have to be obtained to
finance any sizeable program. Never-
theless, those on the scene say these
could probably come from founda-
tions. It is even quite possible that
..the White House would push for early
passage of an emergency request for
funds to see that such a scientific-
venture got underway. The present
Administration, which credits itself
with the break-through which led to
the ping pong matches, is certain to
push harder- for a more forceful ex-
change now that the door is slightly
open, even if the Administration has
to finance an exchange from funds
which it might consider of an emergen-
cy nature.
The updating of papers on Chinese
advancements has been underway for
some time. The National Academy of
Sciences, neenared, about_300_ni
for just such a possibility in 1968.
But the papers remained undisturbed
after it became known that an ex-
change was far in the future.
The Committee on Scholarly Com-
munications with the People's Repub-
lic of China, a highly placed group,
has been studying the activity in-
tensely. Headed by Dr. John Lindbeck
until his recent death, this committee
is perhaps the most knowledgeable of
any group as to just what is to be
found in China, if and when an ex-
change takes place. Committee mem-

Curing the Incurable'
* Other reports point out that the
integration of western medicine and
Chinese traditional medicine has re-
sulted in successful treatment of many
common and recurrent diseases as well
was curing some of the "incurable"
“diseases such as osteomatosis, epilepsy
and chronic laryngitis proliforans.
A mass program in which Chinese
traditional medicine and medicinal
wherbs are being used to prevent and
treat diseases and heal injuries is
sweeping the country, according to
reports. Several instances of rejoining
severed limbs to the body by using
herbal drugs have been described. As
part of this broad movement "red
"medical counters" have been set up in
Canton's state-run drugstores to treat
-
minor injuries and illnesses and recur-
ring diseases by several methods in-
cluding acupuncture and injections.
To assist in the struggle against
disease a new type of diadynamic
current stimulator used for back
strains, sprains and neuralgia has
been developed. Transistors substitute
for electronic tubes and ordinary dry
batteries for alternating current, the
stimulator no larger than a book. A
transistor device with a freezing micro-
tome and a unit for cryotherapy has
been developed, lessening the time for
making thin sections for rapid biopsy
inspections and used in the treatment
of skin diseases and surgical pro-
cedures in dealing with was and tiny
vascular tumors..
Population Control
Shanghai recently has been the scene
of posters urging young people to
marry later in life, prompting ob-
servers to believe the Chinese are
taking serious note of the population
increase. At a Tokyo family planning
conference recently it was reported

The geophysicist is Dr. Robert
Abe whose father has been

McCarthy Suggests Borders
Of Nation Be Closed to Coe
By G. Milton Kelly
Aciated Press Reporter
Senator Joseph R. McCarthy
(R-Wis) suggested yesterday
that the State Department “im-
¡mediately close the borders” to
Frank Coe, saying the former
secretary of the International
Monetary Fund should not be
allowed to leave the country.
-
"I think he is an extremely
dangerous man," McCarthy said
after Coe, a former Federal fi-i
nancial expert, refused to say
whether he is a Communist or
was a Communist spy while:
holding his $20,000-a-year job.
with the Monetary Fund.
Coe protested what he called
McCarthy's "command" to the
State Department.

"Outrageous, False"
By Herbert Foster
United Press Reporter

Austrian currency valuations to favor the Communists.
He read his statement to re-

"The Government also bared secret reports intended to show how a fantastic
Soviet underground web was woven deep into Washington in the early New Deal days to
influence United States Government Policy.

"CHAMBERS has testified that he approached BERLE in 1939 to warn him of
Communist activities in the U.S.
{ "CHAMBERS has also accused HISS of feeding him State Department secrets
before the war in wholesale fashion. HISS was indicted for perjury when he denied
ever giving CHAMBERS state documents or even seeing him after January 1, 1937.
"HISS was tried for perjury last spring but a jury split eight for conviction
and four for acquittal, and a new trial was ordered.
"The second report in the form of twin memos on the underground was full

"The names case out in nemos written by Raymond MURPHY, Security officer

"Underground beadquarters in Washington, the memos said, included
'a violin study near Dupont Circle run by Helen WARE, (and) a school on the
outskirts of Washington run by Alice MENDHAM.
"CHAMBERS was quoted as saying he entered 'the Washington picture" in
1935 and left it and the party at the end of 1937.
"The
The heads of the various underground groups in Washington who met with
PETERS,' the memos continued, 'were the HISSES, KRAMER (KRITTIZKY), Henry COLLINS
who was either a secretary or treasurer of the group; John LET, Lee FRESSMAN,
Hat PERIQW and Nat WITT.
"*These men met regularly at special meetings, with the exception of Donald
HISS, who did not have an organization. They headed parallel organizations......
"The memos alleged there were other underground Commmist groups in
Washington at the time, "but this was the elite policy-making, top-level group."
"It was not a spy ring,' read the records, "but one far more important and
curning because its members helped to shape policy in their departments.'
"The memos described Henry COLLINS, as an employee of the forestry division
of the Agriculture Department at the time and said he took the lead in deliverying
Government documents to CHAMBERS.
"In testimony after the memos were read, CHAMBERS said sailors or stevards
of the North German Lloyd Line usually took Government secrets to Europe for the
ring."
