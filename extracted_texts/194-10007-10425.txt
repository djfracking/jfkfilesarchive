STATEMENT (Continued)
Q Do you have friends who are members of dissident, anti-Army, or anti-war groups
or organizations?
A. No, but most of my friends do not like the Army. I do not know their reasons:
To what country do you owe your allegiance?
Q.
A. The United States.
Q.
-
Do you support the Constitution of the United States and are you willing to
-defend the United States against any and all of her enemies without exception?
ALI support the Constitution and am willing to fight any enemies who invade the
United States but I am not willing to fight in Viet Nam because I believe the
war is immoral.

Q.
If called upon to fight in Viet Nam would you go?
I would try to obtain Conscientious Objector status. If that did not work I do
not know what I would do.
Would you be willing to go on Active Duty if called upon?
I would not be willing to be called to Active Duty and I do not know if I would
'go if called.
Why are you opposed to killing?
VILT
I was brought up to be opposed to killing. They wanted to teach me in four
*months to kill somebody and you can not teach in four months something which is
opposed to what you have been taught for many years.
Are these attitudes due to religious beliefs?
Yes, I am Catholic and do not believe in killing.
If you had to kill someone in self-defense what would you do?
I would fight back but this is different than being placed in Viet Nam where
I would probably have to kill.
If you were in Viet Nam and were under fire would you kill the enemy?
Yes, I would. Any human being would fight back,
If a foreign power attacked the United States would have, any objection to killing
the aggressor?
A. No, not really.
Q. Do you have anything further to add?
