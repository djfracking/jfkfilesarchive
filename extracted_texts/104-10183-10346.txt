Through Mr. Ellis Chief of the Ground Branch of
SOU, and Mr. Wall, of the same branch, one-half day
orientation courvo was given to the first trainees who
suggested that a full day yould be sufficient due to the
lovel of the above trainees and the experience they have
in this fiold.
Arrangements have been made with Mr. Luria and
Mr. Fritz Пeko of TSD/Training to provide Hajor Luis 06
Alfonso Lchom with a Fings and Sools course for the
period of 19-30 April at a T3D Safe House. It is believed
the Flupe and Seals course will benefit CIA because it
"will offer HERSCHOOL the opportunity to maintain closer
contact with Och will be responsible for this type
activity in SIRA SIPA proposes to make a concertod
offort in the letter intercept fiold to keep botter
informed of the extreme loftist offorts to overthrow the
11 Venezuelan government, and it is felt that URSCHWOOD_
can keep abreast of the operation. Because of SIFA' B] 29
0329
responsibilities, it is believed that the more efficient
effort that [SIFA Jean gole in this field will result to
the benefit of CIA.inĵor Ochoa would take the first six
wooks of the covert training course then devote the last
two weeks to the flaps and Souls course.
10. It is also requested that TS9/Training provide
a one-day course in Audio Surveillance and flaps and
Seals for the other three trainees at the R & S Building.
This should be a very general briefing with the least
possible emphasis on ocuplicated, expensive equipment
that might be later requested by the trainoes. It ia
believed this general introduction will give the SIYA 29
trainees some idea as to approaches and problema involved
in these fields as well as the pitfalls that should be
avoided. This one-day course was given to the first three
trafuoen who appeared improused with the coucepta expoand
to them, This subject has also been discussed with Mr.
Luria and a fira date has boen selected for the training.
The OTit Instructor will accompany the trainees and act
as translator.
