supervise property that has not been confiscated by the
state. This is considered by members of the family in
the U.S. to be only an excuse for remaining in Cuba,
The father is thought to have a sizeable bank account
in the U.S. which was accrued prior to and during the
early days of the Castro regime. Although the mother has
access to the funds, she is trying to avoid use of the
funds for personal reasons.
Mrs. ROVIROSA is believed to be employed by HEW as
an IBM key-punch operator in the Refugee Center (JMWAVE
has verified the employment as key-punch operator, GS-3,
Salary $4,269.00 per annum. Employed since 14 December 1966
on a temporary basis.).
JERSAVIT has heard nothing concerning the father
alleged ill health. To the contrary, a sister of Mrs.
ROVIKOSA describes the husband as being very active in
Cuba and believes he may possibly have obtained
from Mrs. ROVIROSA.

4. In view of the background information concerning the
dependents in this case, JMWAVE does not plan to reply to the

REFERENCE:
UFGW-8306, 8 December 1966
MICROFILM
1. In accordance with guidance provided in the Reference con-
cerning Case #94 (201-283357), the monthly payment to the first
depondent (mother) Graciela EOVIROBA for the dependents of
201-283357 was adjusted by terminating the $50.00 monthly payment
for the second dependens (father) in Cuba and continuing payment
of $175.00 monthly to the first dependent. A letter of explana-
tion prepared by the case officer was enclosed in the 31 December
1966 mailing by AMTIKI/1 of tho January 1967 payment.
2 On 10 January 1967 a reply dated 2 January 1967 was re-
ceived from Mrs. ROVIEOSA in which resumption of the payment for
the second dependent is requested. 111 health of the father and
his need for assistance are cited as justification. A copy of
the letter is forwarded under separate cover for Headquarters
information.
3. In accordance with the recommendation contained in para-
graph one of Reference, Stanley JEKSAVIT has provided the following
background information on the dependents in this case which results
from personal direct knowledge of the family:
1.
The mother, fre. Graciela POVIPOSA, comes from one of the
wealthiest, if not the most wealthy, family in Camaguey Province.
She left Cuba in 1959 or 1960 in anticipation of what has
happened, taking all her personal wealth with her. At the samO
time, her share of the family fortune was forwarded to her in
the U.8. as long as this policy continued, perhaps until 1962.

Her husband, Jose A. RODRIGUEZ, did not leave with her
because of a mistress in Cuba. Mr
a Cuba. Mrs. ROVIROSA contemplated
divorce at that time but no divorce ever came about. Although
the father stated numerous times that he intended to leave
Cuba, and his name is on the "airlift" listing, he now states
that he is not going to leave Cuba because he must stay to

Mr. Flores,
This morning I received an answer from r. Alfredo Carcia, Fresident
the GARCIA LIE, giving the bio data requested on dependents of the
crew we are still paying. This completes the bio cata required for the
actuary study.
When I called Mr. Evan's office to give his secretary the above
information concerning the GARCIA people, she told me the computing
of the money involved was started yesterday and we may get our total
figure within a week. I have the draft mono written by Mr. Millian and
the new first page which I revised. As soon as we receive that big, fat
figure from WUMUTUAL the final momo can be typed and we will be in business.

1. The Subject meeting was held in the DD/S Conference

Committee were present. Also attending, were the Chief, DO
Division, the Committee Advisor, the WUMUTUAL Secretariat (Evans

and Mrs. Nancy Gratz representing WH Division. The WH repre-

matter. He stated that the payments to the dependents of the

Cuban Brigade have been made since 1961 under Presidential order,
which order in effect stated that the payments were to be mado
until rescinded by the President. Since that time, the Agency
has spent approximately $17,000,000 on the overall program, of
which $12,000,000 represents direct stipends to the beneficiaries.

1. In order to submit accurate figures for the approved actuary
study we must immediately establish some definite criteria for survivor
payments in the event the principal dependent is terminated for cause.
2. I find it difficult to accept the inheritance formula that HAVE
says has been SOP, 1. e. when the first dependent is terminated the second
"dependent inherits the first dependent's share and so on down the line.
In the first place, the Station hasn't been consistent in following this
procedure and the fact it was originally established by AMEUD is no reason
for us to continue it. Regardless of the background for this unrealistic
procedure it seems that the whole matter is now at a point where policy
governing future payments should be determined at the Headquarters level
and the actuary study can't be started until we supply firm figures that
are not subject to a variety of changes over the years. Furthermore, the
Station views and clasification of the background leading to the present
procedure, which was requested over a week ago, has not been forthcoming.
3, I think we can live with the following formula as it isn't
too inconsistent with BEC survivorship provisions. I discussed the following
with Mr. Millian who agreed the provisions seemed to be thoroughly practical
and realistic if you concur.
ok
ok.
(a) In those cases where the parents are the sole beneficiaries, in the
event one dies the survivor will be paid the larger of the two
payments now received, which would be 3175 instead of the $225.
now received by both of them.
(b) When a widow dies or remarries, her payment will be divided
equally among the surviving minor children in lieu of the graduated
payments they are now receiving. This may cost us a little more than
Just lopping off the widow's share and continuing the amounts
presently paid to the children but we will minimizė possible
repercussions from the widow if she is still alive and remarried.
It is also much more equitable to the children themselves to share and
share alike in the event the mother dies. An additional provision
should be that as each child reaches 21 or marries, his payment will
be terminated, except in those cases where a child is physically or
mentally incapacitated for life. In such cases the child will be
paid for life.
In answer to any possible static over these provisions we can always
fall back on the original cover story concerning availability of AVBUD funds.
4. May I have your opinion on the above proposal so that I can provide
Air. Evans with the statistics necessary to start the actuary study without
further delay?

control of the money: This could account for the
discrepancy between the amount of money now hold
in trust and the total amount of money paid from
1961-1963 since the new trusteeship was not croated
until such of the money had been spent. In order to
protect the interests of the prisoner, some procedure
will probably be devised by which a long-range
projection can be made for actuary purposes and the
trusteeship torminated. Recommendations for handling
this case will be submitted to JWAVE in the near
future.
3. In order to arrive at the exact amount of money to
be saved by the immediate and future termination of paymenta
to certain depondents, a definite criteria must be established
concerning adjustments for secondary dependents when tho
first cependent has been terminated. In discussions between
Ellen F. MARGANY
MARGANY, Curing her recent TDT to JEWAVE, and
Humphrey O. TIMAHUS, it was MARGANY's understanding that the
procedure is to raise the second dependent to the status
of first dependent when the original first dépendent i
terminated for cause. For example, the first child would
receive the amount originally paid to the mother instead
of the customary $50 paid to a second dependent, and thō third
dependent would then become the second dependent and receive
$50 instead of the original #25. This procedure 26 not
followed in case # 44 where the second dependent paymont
remained at $50 after the remarriage of the mother, Case
# 25 where child, now sole dependent, does not receive full
1st dependent payment, nor la the contentious CUERVO-RUBIO
case (# 54) where an attempt to hold the second dependent
to $50 précipitated considerable unpleasantness. llowever,
in case # 86, the procedure of raising the payment level
of the second and third dependents after the remarriage of
the mother, was followed. Logically, the termination of
payments to dependents in any of the top categories would
automatically lead to an adjustment in status and payment
to not only children, but in some cases parents as well,
depending on their position of inheritance. A clorification
of Station's past procedure, any known committments to
dependents, and present views as to firm criteria to be
followed in such cases is urgently requested. Not only is
such a fixed criteria necessary to determine the amount of
savings involved in the recommended immediate termination,
and to provide accurate long-range figures for the actuary
study, but also for the purpose of avoiding any possible
repercussions such as occurred in the CUERVO-RUBIO case.

PER Cruzata. If the lawyer who represents
FRITZ could be discreetly queried, the true
status of the relationship between the "widow"
and PEREZ might be established and lead to a
termination of her payment. If JMWAVE concurs,
recommend ANTIKI be instructed to pursue this
investigation.
Case
Terminate payment to deceased 2nd dependent,
mother of Herman KOCH.
Caso 94
Terminate payment to 2nd dependent, father of
Joso FERNANDEZ Rovirosa, who apparently receives
no support from mother of deceased. Stanley JERSANIT
can supply some background on dependents in this
case who are both from wealthy families.
Case # 122
Amount and method of payments to dependents in
this case was directed by Headquarters and handled
by Humphrey O. TIMANUS. According to the question-
nairo filled out by 1st dependent, father of Manuel
REYES Garcia, father is not following instructions
to provide for the wife and child in Cuba, as well
as, provide certain comforts for his imprisoned son.
It is recommended that this case be reviewed with
TIMANUS and AKTIKI resume trusteeship of funds
for the widow and child and prisoner. The father.
and stepmother should then be paid $25 apiece, as
3rd and 4th dependents. The remaining $225 per
month would then be deposited in the existing trust
account at the Coconut Grove Bank.
:
Case #131
Terminate payment to 2nd dependent, son of Jose
.BORRAS Gutierrez. Son, Alfredo BORRAS Macias
was born 19 April 1943 and is over 21 years of age.
2. Although the money saved by the above terminations
is small in comparison to the total amount expended each month,
it is a beginning which hopefully will lead to more terminations
in the near future. All trusteeships are presently being
reviewed and JMWAVE will acvised as rapidly as possible con-
cerning trusteeships to be terminated completely or adjusted.
Two trusteeships that require special study concern casos
142 and #144 as follows:
Case # 142
Jorge GUTIERREZ Izaguirre designated his parents
as dependents. It is recommended that the Trustee
be requested to submit the names of the uncle and
aunt who have possession of the bank book and
obtain the exact amount of money on deposit. The
uncle may be Alfredo HORNKLO, a former prominent
Cuban businessman now in the US, for whom GUTIERREZ
formerly worked in Cuba. GUTIERREZ also has a

ABSTRACT
MICROFILM
© Quarterly Progress Report Concerning the AMBUD Program
ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCER
1. Transmitted herewith are two copies of the Quarterly
Progress report for the First Quarter of FY 67 concorning the
AMBUD program.
2. As explained in the attached report, in the absence of
any Headquarters approval to carry out the cost reduction plan
proposed by the Station in FY 66 AMBUD expenditures are running
at the rate of approximately $34,000 per month. If this rate
is continued throughout FY 67, then the total cost for the year
will be approximately $408,000, as compared with the $230,000
projected by the Station for the fiscal year. The Station has
been kept well informed by Headquarters concerning its struggles
to place the AMBUD program on a reasonable and economic basis.
Until a decision is taken at the Headquarters level, the Station
will continue to administer the AMBUD program under the present
ground rules.

Problems
7. The amount of $250,000.00 originally authorized for the
medical phase of the AMBUD program has been almost depleted since
expenditures have reached a level of approximately $220,000.00,
with bills outstanding of $3,250.00. Headquarters was informed
in UFGA-26075 that cases remaining which require médical treat-
ment may necessitate the expenditure of sums in excess of the
original authorization.
D. Plans for Next Quarter
8. It is expected that payment of dependent benefits and
medical expenses for Brigado members will continue unchanged
during the coming quarter. One possible exception would be the
termination of any romaining medical cases upon release by medi-
cal authorities for return to self-supporting status.

MEMORANDUM OF CONVERSATION
September 9, 1966
5:30 p. m.
SUBJECT: Manuel Artime leader of the Bay of Pigs expedition
Artime came to see me at his own initiative. The meeting had been
arranged through Congressman Dante Fascell's office. I have known
Artime for several years, but had not seen him for about two years.
Artime stated that the purpose of his visit was to express some per-
sonal views about the Cuban situation. He said he fully appreciated the
fact that the Cuban exile looks at his homeland in a manner quite different
from the United States Government with its world-wide responsibilities.
. Nevertheless, he thought it important that hit-and-run raids be resumed
against Cuba to (1) keep up the hopes of the opposition inside the island
and (2) force Fidel to maintain a high state of alert which materially
subtracts from his economic efforts. Artime noted that assets to make
these raids are available but are not being used. He did not specifically
ask for support to resume his activities.
I told him that while his arguments had certain merit, there were also
other considerations which should be kept in mind, I. e., that hit-and-run
ralds provido a pretext for Castro to turn the screws of repression harder
on the Cuban people and to place the blame for his own failure on external
attacks. Artime acknowledged the validity of these arguments and did not
pursue the matter further.
Artime said that he had reached the point where he had to think of finding
a job to support his wife and three children. He indicated a preference
for a job that would permit him to travel throughout Latin America so
that he could maintain his contacts in other countries, and asked that I
let him know if I learned of any opportunities. I said I would.

Brigade members be reduced.

2. I was told that WH is presently expending some $255.000
per year for 144 cases of KIA's and MIA's, which figure includes
the 16 still in prison on criminal charges that predate their membership
in the Brigade. It was emphasized, however, that the proposed cut
back would not include the 16. I also learned that the impulse for
reopening this matter was a Wave dispatch (UFGA--25261, 3 June 1966).
Among other things, this proposed that effective 30 June a new
payment schedule be established, and that payments to trustees be dia-
continued entirely.
3. I told Gratz and Millian that while the reference sought our
opinion regarding the proposed action, the matter of payments to de-
pendents was political rather than legal. In this connection. I referred
to such memoranda as Bissell's of 8 May 1961 and Helms' of 31 December
1962. which indicate that the White House had determined that these
payments would be made. In response to the prepresentation that the
search of WH/C files. failed to reflect any policy guidance subsequent
to that set out in the DDP's memorandum of 31 December, I suggested
that the Wave proposal be discussed with Mr. Sam Halpern, who had
previously served as Executive Officer, TFW

regarding the lack of policy guidan, saying that it was set out in the
YOBITE messages to Wave. copies of which could be found in WH/C
files. It was his view that the White House would not want to risk...
the charge of bad faith, even if the Government might ultimately
realize a saving of some quarter of a million dollars a year. He took
the position that if WH/C wished to raise the matter for the DCI's
present consideration, it should first familiarize itself with YOBITE
traffic. Halpern agreed with me that this subject was not one for con..
sideration by the 303 Committee. We concluded with a suggestion that
Chief, WH/C might wish to discuss that matter with Chief. WH/D
before proceeding further.

States Covernment decided to resume this type of activity. I told him I
fully understood his deep desire to see his country freed and what great
efforts he had made toward this objective, and thanked him for the offer.
He also asked that I do what I could to prevent suspension of remittances
to families of those who had fought against Castro. I told him I knew
nothing about this but would look into it.
In departing he expressed doop appreciation for my having given him so
much time (1 hour) and for having the chance to converse with one who
understood Cuba's problems and his preoccupations. This was a rather
subdued and reflective Artime quite a contrast with the fiery and com-
bative Artime of two years ago.

C. A lump sum arbitrary payment of $3,000 which
would be a year's dependency at the highest rate (250 per
month).
2. Obviously, the above recommendations as well
others proposed at various timos in an effort to terminate
this costly exercise were never acted on and due to the
timo lag are probably no longer practical. Tentative
approaches to the problem were also made by exploring the
possibility of working out some mechanism by which HEW could
take over disbursements at a reduced rate and periodic
rulings and guidance were requested from the General
Counsel concerning the legal and security factors inherent
in the proposals.
.
3. When the original cover mechanism was established
for disbursing these payments, the dependents were apparently
advised that such payments would continue as long as funds
were available. In view of the indefinite time stipula-
tion together with the long-standing demise of the AMBUD
organization and its relationship to this program, dependents
could reasonably be expected to philosophically accept the
fact that these funds have finally been exhausted.

tests from dissidents can be anticipated with the usual
security hazards whenever the decision is made to terminate

indefinite continuation of this enormous expenditure of
funds which to date amounts to approximately $2,000,000.00.
Any question that may arise as to who has really been foot
ing this bill is unlikely to cause any shock to the public

captured or missing in action despite the many recommenda-
tions made at various times to resolve this problem. This
lack of policy is implicit in a memorandum from Mr. Helms
to the DDCI dated 23 May 1962 in which he referred to a
Presidential oral directive that payments to dependents
were to be continued until termination by Presidential
order. A later memorandum from Mr. Helms to the DDCI, dated
31 December 1962, contained recommendations for terminating
these monthly payments with a lump sum death payment to
be made to dependents of those killed or missing in action.
Both memoranda are attached for your review A memorandum
from Mr. Sterling Cottrell to the Attorney General, dated
1: February 1963, concerning various agreements reached
between Brigade leaders, AMBUD and the Agency, also included
three possible alternatives for resolving the problem of
dependency payments as follows:
A.
-
Follow regulations established by the Bureau
of Employment Compensation, i.e. $1,000 lump sum payment
for loss of life.
=
"
B. Follow U.S. Army practice, i.e. monthly.
payments of $122 or more (depending on rank and length
of service) for as long as the widow survives and does
not re-marry. This, Mr. Cottrell pointed out, would be a
costly program to administer and would cost roughly $300,000
a year for an indefinite period. (This has proven to be
true).

MEMORANDUM FOR: General Counsel
SUBJECT:
Payments to Dependents of
Brigade 2506 Members
•
1.
Attached hereto is a copy of a memorandum
containing recommendations for phasing out payments
to dependents of Brigade 2506 members. WH/Cuba plans
to propose phasing out and terminating these payments
but, before doing so, a review of the legal factors by
the office of the General Counsel is desired. It is
requested that an estimate be given of possible residual
U.S. Government liability in these cases, and advice as
to whether they can be handled on the basis of one-time
termination payments.
2. In addition to the above, WH/Cuba would
appreciate any advice or suggestions on methods or
procedures which might be used in effecting the
terminations.
3. A reply from your office would be appreciated
on or before 10 August 1966.

of deceased with the understanding such payments will con-
tinue until the status of each man is resolved (either by
release or death while in prison) or leave the present
amount being paid unchanged with indefinite continuation.
Considering the few involved (16 according to the JMWAVE
study), the last proposal would probably be botter from a
psychological point of view and remove any possibility of
charges against us of endangering the lives of the prisoners.
Furthermore, the memorandum from Mr. Cottrell to the
Attorney General referred to in paragraph 1 included as
part of the general agreement reached with Brigade leaders
assurance that payments to dependents of Brigade members
remaining in prison would be continued. Ono case that
falls in this category is extremely interesting. It
concerns case #13 who is imprisoned under an alias and in
order to insure his safety there seems to be a tacit agree-
mont to treat him as dead. It may be quite a feat to
avoid a charge of discrimination against his wife if her
payments are terminated "as a widow" in order to preserve
the "deceased" cover to preserve his safety.

.D. Prior to submitting recommendations to the
303 Committee for phasing out dependency payments, a ruling
on all the legal and possible security aspects of any
proposal should probably be obtained from the General Counsel.
I have not explored in depth the background of
the benefits presently being paid to the dependents of
Heroes/Martyrs, the majority of which do not appear to
have been Brigade members and do not come under the same
criteria established for Brigade members. In the event
you are contemplating terminating this type of payments
such action could no doubt be defended as not boing ap-
plicable to the conditions governing dependents of Brigade
mombers. It has been my understanding that your proposal
to submit a memorandum to the 303 Committee in the immediate
future concerns only recommendations for resolving the
Brigade dependency payments. If I am incorrect and such a
memorandum is to also cover the continued payments to
Heroes/Martyrs dependents, please advise me as to what you
wigh done.

principal himself or his heirs has the legal right to
revoke a trusteeship even in the mishandling of funds.
Based on a review of pertinent documents and a discussion
with Mrs. Evic Vidal, who is probably more knowledgeable
of the facts and nuances of this problem than anyone else,
I have listed below some recommendations for your con-
sideration:
A. In line with recent JMWAVE recommendations
payments to all principal dependents (wives who have not
remarried) be reduced by 30 July, or as soon as feasible,
to a flat $100 por month and all minor dependents reduced
to $25 per month with notification that all payments will
cease 6 months from date of initial reduction. All secondary
dependents, such as dependent parents who receive separate
checks of not more than $50 por month, should be continuod
at the present rate until the final termination date for
all dependents.
>
B. Such adjustments as recommended above should
bo uniform and across the board with no attempt to
evaluate each case on an individual basis determined by
such factors as outside income, need, etc. This would
not only tend to create an undesirable security hazard but
would complicate the phasing out of an already complicated
ation. Furthermore, individuals who have made an
effort to raise their standard of living by augmentation
of their income would be justified in feeling they wore
penalized for having more ambition than some of the lazy
pensioner types. Once we attempt to play the role of
Solomon as to who is the most worthy or the most needy,
we lose sight of the fact that all dependents are equal
as widows whose husbands died for the same cause and we
could expect no end of recriminations. Neither should
there be any distinction as is recommended in some instances
by JMWAVE that payments should cease because dependents
happen to reside in Cuba. They are as entitled to the
same benefits as those fortunate enough to reside in this
country. The exception to this may be justified in those.
isolated cases where it is evident that nothing has been
heard from such dependents and they have never received
any benefits from the money paid for their support. In
these instances payments to trustees should probably be
terminated immediately if such action is legal.
C. In the case of the known prisoners, two
courses of action could be pursued. Either cut the present
dependency payments in line with that proposed for dependents

3. AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION OF VARIOUS FACTORS INVOLVED
STATION DECIDED IT PREFERABLE FOR STATION TO MAKE FINAL JUDGMENT
AND THAT IT NOT NECESSARY TO SEEK ASSESSMENT FROM SOCIAL WORKER,
ESPECIALLY SINCE DATA ON FORMS IN MOST CASE / IN SOME INSTANCES
RECIPIENT REFUSED TO ANSWER QUESTIONS/ IS SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE
EQUITABLE JUDGMENT TO BE MAVE. TOU SOCIAL WORKERS WERE NOT AVAILABLE
BECAUSE OF CUBAN AIRLIFT REQUIREMENTS.

4. ANALYSIS OF DATA COLLECTED INDICATED ADVISABILITY OF
ESTABLISHING CRITERIA GENERALLY APPLICABLE TO ALL CATEGORIES OF
BENEFICIARIES, THEN MAKING EXCEPTIONS ONLY IN CASES WHERE GENUINE
HUMANITARIAN OR HARDSHIP FACTORS EXIST. SURVEY REVEALED, AS ANTI-
CIPATED, THAT NUMBER OF DEPENDENTS. HAVE MADE STRONG EFFORT TO

COVER IT CLEAR MOST RECIPIENTS CONSIDER THEY RECEIVING BENEFIT FROM
ODYOKE/.
5. JMWAVE RECOMMENDS FOLLOWING ACTION.
A. THAT BENEFIT PAYMENTS BE CONTINUED AT THE PRESENT RATE
UNTIL 30 JUNE 1966.
B. . THAT EFFECTIVE 1 JULY 1966 A NEW SCHEDULE OF BENEFIT
PAYMENTS BE ESTABLISHED. JMWAVE RECOMMENDS THAT THIS SCHEDULE
COMPRISE /1/ $100 PER MONTH FOR THE FIRST DEPENDENT, /2/ $25 PER
MONTH FOR EACH ADDITIONAL DEPENDENT..
BE HALTED.
c. THAT EFFECTIVE 1 JULY 1966 ALL PAYMENTS. TO TRUSTEES..
D. THAT ON THE BASIS OF THE DATA CONTAINED IN THE CURRENT
SURVEY ACTION BE INITIATED BY AMTIKI 1 PRIMARILY THRU LETTER
CONTACT/ TO ATTEMPT TO RETRIEVE THE FUNDS ALLEGEDLY HELD IN CERTAIN
TRUSTEE ACCOUNTS OR BY CERTAIN TRUSTEES. IN THOSE INSTANCES WHERE THE
TRUSTEE HAS DEMONSTRATED HONESTY AND CORRECT DEALING IN THE MAIN-
TENANCE OF A TRUSTEE ACCOUNT WITH A REPUTABLE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION
THE CURRENT ACCOUNT WOULD BE LEFT IN PRÉSENT DEPOSITORY. HOWEVER,
PER PARA 5 C. ABOVE NO ADDITONAL FUNDS WOULD BE PAID TO TRUSTEE FOR
DEPOSIT.
.
E. THAT A TERMINAL DATE FOR THE PAYMENT OF ALL BENEFITS
BE FIXED. JMWAVE RECOMMENDS THAT THIS DATE BE EITHER /1/ 30 DECEMBER
1966, OR /2/ 30 JUNE 1967.

1. When Wallace A. GROWERY met with AMBIDDY/1 on 13 January
1967 to formally terminate the AHWORLD operation, AMBIDDY/1
discussed in detail reference dependents who had been receiving
financial assistance from ANTORLD funds and requested that
GROWERY explore the possibility of WOFACT financial assistance
following termination of their AMWORLD monthly support payments.
An investigation was conducted by both JMWAVE and Headquarters to
determine if the agents named by AMBIDDY/1 had been employed by
WOFACT in order to determine what, if any, obligation might
exist to provide financial assistance to the dependents.
results of the combined Headquarters investigation, keyed to
reference dependents, are summarized below for Station Managua
information.
(IDEN A). Subject was a OFACT agent under contract.
The
His
MOC provided payment of his $400 monthly salary to.
his dependent parents for two years following pos-
sible death while engaged on a WOFACT mission.
After Subject's execution in 1962 the parents received
his regular monthly salary until 28 June 1963. At
that time Headquarters decided to liquidate the
remaining balance of $6400 and paid this amount in a
lump sum to the parents. Headquarters considers that
all legal and moral obligations have been discharged
and is not inclined to assume' any further financial
obligations to the parents. AMBIDDY/1 is apparently
unaware that the parents have received approximately
$10,000 from HOFACT.

Documentation for Hero and Martyr Dependency Cases
ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES
Reference: UFGW-6440, 8 March 1967
1. A review of Station and AMTIKI files confirms a total
lack of legal documentation for the Hero and Martyr cases as
anticipated by Headquarters in Reference. A report prepared by
AMTIKI-1, which is forwarded herewith, describes the content of
his filos for these cases and includes a copy, where availablo,
of the authorization upon which payment is based.
2. Although the review of Station records for legal documents
was unproductive, the following background data was noted as of
possible interest to Headquarters in the processing of these problem
cases:
a. Children included as dependents:
Case #95: one child (in U.S.A.) Total monthly payment $25.00

AMOT-186 (201-726322) receives a monthly payment of $66.00

whom are in Cuba. The turstee is not a full-time AMOT and

Although IDEN C, the husband of IDEN B, was
B, was never
directly employed by WOFACT, IDEN B receives $175
per month as a dependent HEROES/MARTYRS widow under
the AMBUD program and has been paid a total of
$10,850 from March 1962 to date through the
JMWAVE/ALBUD cover mechanism. Presumably AMBIDDY/1
is unaware that this dependent has been receiving
regular ANBUD assistance in addition to the $125
per month received from AMWORLD funds.
AMBIDDY/1\ provided GROWERY with the complete name
and details of the activities of IDEN D's husband
prior to his arrest and subsequent 6-30 year pri-
son sentence. With this information traces were
run on Subject with negative results. Since neither
JMWAVE nor Headquarters records produced any evidence
Subject had ever been a WOFACT employee, no obligation
exists to provide financial assistance to IDEN B.
2. Although reference indicates the discussion between James
D. ZABOTH and Ernest A. LUSBY took place after AMBIDDY/l's conver-
sation with GROWERY in January, it is not clear when, or by whom,
the subject was originally brought to ZABOTT's attention.
AMBIDDY/1 was the source of ZABOTH's information it is noteworthy
If
that he apparently neglected to mention his prior detailed dis-
cussion with GROWERY.
3. Under the circumstances, it is not possible for Head-
quarters to take any action to provide support to these individuals.

SUBJECT: Review of Certain Hero and Martyr Case Files
•
The "Heroes and Martyrs" cases were not considered-under
the same regulations as the dependents of the invaders of
the Bay of Pigs. The persons suposed to receive payment
were designated, in some cases by "the Department" and in
other cases by the C.R.C. through its executives. There
are cases in which a written memorandum was given to us but
there are others in which no memorandum was given. We were
instructed to pay no more than $175.00 monthly to each, and
as it can be seen, many cases are receiving lower amounts
and never the amount of dependents was taking in considera-
tion. There is only one case receiving a higher amount,
Mrs. Hilda R. Carballo (widow of Jesus Delgado), who receives
$250.00 because we were specially instructed to pay this a-
mount.

UFGA-8317, 1 April 1963, describes four of the
several individuals who were involved with AMLEMON-1
in a sabotage attempt against the Cuban Electric
Company on 30 November 1960. The four all for

RODRIGUEZ was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment which
is being served in the Isle of Pinos Prison.

The Trustee describes himsolf, in the HEW Survey
form, as a former employee of the Cuban Electric Company
and a friend of the Subjects of Case #99. He is mentioned
in a 26 September 1962 AMOT roport (AA-812; UFG-01672,..
12 Oct. '82) as residing in Miami where he received
letters, containing information, from source Martha RAMOS
Castro in Havana. Traces, show--RAMOS to be the wife of
Armando RODRIGUEZ and the sister-in-law of the widow of
Julio CASIELLES. The trusteo stated in the HEW Survey
form that one year previously he forwarded the accumulated
funds and started sending $33.00 each month to RAMOS in
Chicago, per instructions by the CASIELLES widow, and that
in May 1965 he stopped sending the $33.00 payment for the

1. When Wallace A. GROWERY met with AMGIDDY/1 on 13 January
1967 to formally terminate the AMWORLD operation, AMBIDDY/1
discussed in detail reference dependents who had been receiving
financial assistance from AMWORLD funds and requested that
GROWERY explore the possibility of VOPACT financial assistance
following tormination of their AWORLD monthly support payments.
An investigation was conducted by both JIWAVE and Headquarters to
determine if the agents named by AMDIDDY/1 bad been exployed by
WOFACT in order to determine what, if any, obligation might
exist to provide financial assistance to the dependents. Tho
results of the combined Headquarters investigatioü, keyed to
reference dependents, are summarized below for Station Ka NK gua
information.
(IDEN A) Subject was a ROFACT agent under contract.
Hie
MC provided payment of his 400 monthly salary to
his dependent parents for two years following pon-
sible death while engaged on a WOFACT mission.
After Subject's execution in 1962 the parents received
his regular monthly salary until 23 June 1963. At
that time Headquarters decided to liquidate the
remaining balance of $6400 end paid this amount in a
lump sum to the parents. Readquarters considers that
all legal and moral obligations have been discharged
and is not inclined to assume any further financial
obligations to the parents. AMBIDDY/1 is apparently
unaware that the parents have received approximately
$10,000 from WOFACT.

1. A letter dated 7 May 1967 has been received from Silvia
HEREDIA, 180 S.E. 13th Terrace, Miami, Florida, via the AMTIKI-1
facility. Mrs. HEREDIA is the widow of Jorge FUNDORA Fernandez
(Hero & Martyr, no 201 number) who is the Subject of Case #103 for
which a monthly AMBUD payment of $175.00 is made to the widow.

In
to also send the payment formerly received from AMBIDDY-1 which she
claims was terminated in April 1967.
2.
The JMWAVE
This case was one of three cases for which AMBIDDY requested
in January 1967 that WOFACT assume tho monthly payments being made by
his organization. The request by AMBIDDY was the Subject of Reference
A which requested data from JMWAVE concerning the cases.
reply, forwarded under Reference B, included a recommendation that no
increase in payment be made. Reference C informed the addressee that,
under the circumstances; it was not possible for Headquarters to take
any action to provide support to the individuals concerned.
3.
In view of the background described above, we propose,
Headquarters approval, to have AMTIKI-1 reply to Mrs. HEREDIA stating
with
that no funds are available in addition to the $175.00 monthly payment
which is being made.
4. We are also enclosing copies of the following documentation

(IDEN B)
Although IDET C, the husband of IDEN B, was never
directly employed by FOFACT, IDEN B receives $175
per month pв » dependent HEROES/MARTYRS widow under
the AMBUD program and has boen paid a total of
310,850 from March 1062 to date through tho
JMWAVE/ANDUD cover mechanism. Presumably AMBIDDY/1
is unaware that this depondent has been receiving
regular AMRUD assistanco in addition to the $125
por month received from AWWORLD funds.
(IDEN D). AMBIDDY/1 provided GROWERY with the comploto namo
and details of the activition of IDEN D's husband
prior to his arrest and subsequent 6-30 year pri-
son sentence. With this information traces were
run on Subject with negative results. Since noither.
JMWAVE nor Пendquarters records produced any evidence
Subject had ever boon a WOPACT employee, no obligation
exists to provide financial assistance to IDEM B.
3. Although reference indicates the discussion between Jamen
D. ZABOTH and Ernest A. LUSBY took place after ABIDDY/I's conver-
mation with GROWERY in January, it is not clear when, or by whow,
the subject was originally brought to ZABOTH'a attention. If
AMBIDDY/1 was the source of ZANOTH's information it is noteworthy
that he apparently neglected to mention his prior detailed dis-
cussion with GROWERY.
3. Under the circumstances, it is not possible for Head-
quarters to take any action to provide support to these individuals.

Concerning Dependent Payment for Jorgo KIM Xum (Case #143)
ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES
REFERENCE: UFGA-26771, 17 January 1967
ACTION REQUIRED: As stated in paragraph three
1. Biographic data concerning the paronts of Subject (201-298852)
has been received from the trustee, Raul SANTOVENIA, and is forwarded
herewith as Attachment A.
.
2. A review has been made of JMWAVE, AMTIKI, and AMOT filos
concerning continued justification for the paymont of $225.00 por
month to the trustee on behalf of tho paronts in Cuba.
points resulting from the review are as follows:
a.
Subject was executed
Significant
for a prior crime in Cuba
and not because of participation at the Bay of Pigs.
(Murder of a Cuban soldier during oscape from Cuba in
March 1960). See "Bohemia" clipping forwarded herewith
as Attachment B.
b. The father of Subject, Podro KIM, is probably
identical to one Pedro KIM who is alloged by ANTIKI-1
to be an active communist in Cuba. A Pedro KIM is also
described as an active communist in the following reports:
DCE-15460, 16 August 1963; DCE-15946, 26 October 1962.
C. Although it appears that the trustee has efficiently
handled the funds forwarded to him ($12,602.00 in bank
account as of December 1965), thoro is no evidence that
any form of assistance has boon provided to the depondents
in Cuba.
3. In view of the background of this case, as described in
paragraph 3 above, it is recommended that all payments for this
case bo terminated.

MEMORANDUM FOR:

1.
Chiof, Bonofits and Services Division
Office of Personnel
Samplos of 2506 Brigade Working Files
B
Following the 10 February moeting in your office
with the Director of BEC, Station Miami was requested to
send a representative group of files concerning deceased,
missing and imprisoned Cuban Brigade members and their
dependents who are presently receiving monthly support
payments.
3. Attached in one of the oight files received
from Miami for your review. Since all the documents are
in Spanish, a resume of those documents considered to be
most important for establishing the legal relationship
between the deceased and his dopondents has been attached
for your convenience.
3. An identical resume will be made of the documents
in the remaining seven files in order that they may also
be reviewed whenever it is convenient for you to schedule
a moeting. We may logically, assume that a certain number
of the remaining files will be lacking some of the vital
documents included in the attached file. If these
documents are required to meet BBC criteria on an
individual basis, they could be obtained in practically
all cases from those dependents, who reside in the United
States.
4. The attached file is a rather impressive example
of the type of documented proof we can submit for BEC
scrutiny; perhaps we can avoid having to run the gauntlet
on an individual basin.

ALTHOUGH NO SPECIFIC RECORDS WERE AVAILABLE CONCERNING
THE BREAST OPERATION, WHICH WAS A TOTAL RESECTION, DR. CANO
CONFIRMED THE ORIGINAL BONE OPERATION AS SURGERY FOR A DOUBLE
FRACTURE OF THE HIP. HE ALSO CONFIRMED THE RECENT SURGERY FOR
RETIREMENT OF THE PINS WHICH HAD BEEN PLACED DURING THE FIRST
OPERATION, AND DESCRIBED THE PATIENT'S CONDITION AS 'DELICATE'
BUT NOT CRITICAL. REGARDING FINANCES, DR. CANO SAID THAI A

C. A LETTER FROM JUANO LAGO DE CERVANTES MOTHER OF SUB-
JEČI, DATED 26 OCTOBER 1966 AND ADDRESSED TO THE AMTIKI
FACILITY, STATED THAT THE FATHER WAS UNABLE TO WORK BECAUSE
OF A BAD HEART AND EXPRESSED A REQUEST FOR PAYMENT OF HER
SON'S PENSION'' SINCE THE WIDOW NO LONGER RECEIVED IT BECAUSE
OF HER CHANGE OF STATUS.
D. ACTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ROUTINE PROCEDURE FOR

BY AMTIKI-I, IN A LETTER DATED 31 OCTOBER 1966, THAT ACCORDING
TO THE ESTABLISHED RULES THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY FOR ASSISTANCE

1. Both Headquarters and ANTIKI files reflect Subject o
para 2(k), reference B (prisoner #37 on reference list)
indeed a prisoner, not deceased.
It is suggested that ANTIKI be requested to review
the file for any indication Bubject of para 2 (a) reference B
(prisoner #32 on reference list) may actually bo prisoner
not deceased as reported.
.3. Subject of para 3, reference B (prisoner #36 on
reference A list) is a prisoner. Although he is officially
listed as a GARCIA LINES crewman, he may also have boen one
of the Brigade personalities who served as an auxiliary crewman
on one of the GARCIA LINES ships lost in the invasion. The
dependents of these deceased and imprisoned crewmen are paid
by the GARCIA LINES through a special WOFACT funding mechanism.
This also applies to the AMBUD-3 case, Faustino MARTINEZ, who
receives $300 per month as a permanent disability case.
CELENZA will no doubt recall that during MARGANY's récent
TDY to JMWAVE to review the AMBUD dependency cases MARGANY
advised that all GARCIA LINES dependents would be included
in the proposed recommendations for future financing of AMBUD
dependency payments. Both Subject of para 3, reference B,
and Faustino MARTINEZ wore included in the recently comploted
actuarial study to determine the total amount of money required
to finance future dependency payments under a proposed trust
fund mechanism

1. In accordance with the paragraph 2, Reference A
request for clarification of Case No. 123, a review has been
made of JMWAVE records and the following pertinent data is
forwarded for Headquarters Information:
There is no record of Subject's mother being
designated as a dependent and it is believed that the
AMTIKI-1 request for biographic data concerning her
(paragraph 2(a), Reference B) was an error resulting from
the large number of similar investigations being handled
at that time
b. The monthly payment to the Trustee conforms

of the $50.00 per month child dependent payment and for the
continued payment of $175.00 per month for the widow as the
remaining sole dependent.

In conclusion, the Headquarters records for this Case
would appear to be correct and our error in correspondence is

Attention: Mr. Alfredo Garcia, President
Dear Mr. Garcia:
This is to acknowledge receipt of your letters
dated December 30, 1966 and January 27, 1967 which
contained information concerning the six beneficiaries
currently receiving compensation. We are grateful for
this information.
With regard to Mr. Alfonso Alberti Garcia, our
records show that he completed his rehabilitation
training in June 1965 which qualified him sa radio/
television repairman. In other words, he has a mare
ketable skill which can provide him with employment.
◄T
We would appreciate it if you would terminate
the monthly payment of $275.00 to Mr. Alberti as of
March 1, 1967. Please advise Mr. Alberti that since
his rehabilitation training and a lengthy period of
grace to find employment he will no longer receive
any payments. If he should need any social or finan-
cial assistance, you might suggest that he apply to a
local, state
tate or national welfare agency
Please keep us advised of any further developments
in this case.
Coordinated with:
OGC-Mr. Richard Landsdale 8 Feb.

1. For Headquarters information concerning the AMBUD Dependent
Payment Program, a listing of prisoners forwarded by Referenco A
includes 11 of the 19 AMBUD cases contained in Attachment No. 1 to
Reference B plus one individual believed to be a GARCIA LINES case.
In view of the steps being taken by Headquarters concerning the
proposal to transfer administration of the dependents payment Program
to WUMUTUAL we are forwarding the results of a review of JMWAVE records
pertaining to the individuals included on the Reference A list.
2.
The following data is keyed to the case numbers in Attachment
No. 1 to Reference B
a Case #120: 201-293759. The 1sting of Subject in
attachment No. 1 to Reference B as deceased resulted in the
September 1966 termination of payment to the trustee account
for which AMTIKI-1 is responsible. We do not plan to make
any changes in this account at this time.

DeFelice feels we have conceived a sufficient
number of alternatives to contact BEC directly and discuss
meeting is to be set up next week, possibly
6 February to discuss.
to discuss with Mr. Tinsley, Director of Bureau
of Employees Compensation, who cleared, friendly and very
helpful, with regard to BEC accepting one of the following
solutions+
Takeover of all or most of the funding
of the regular payments, after he has had a chance
to review the files. The Agency would continue to
distribute the payments through cover (there is
precedent in the HEW arrangement) This would not
create a BEC problem according to DeFelice.
BEC takes over the majority under present
arrangement and the Agency continues to handle those
cases which do not qualify under BEC regulations.
c. The BEC pays a lump sum to the Agency fund
which would continue the payments at the present rate
and under the present system until all cases are
terminated.
-
One of the most serious problems facing us at present
is the five-year statute of limitations. One way to get around
this claim would-be-for-the Agency to issue a statement to the
effect that, after the elapse of five years, it is prepared to
make a statement of presumptive or conclusive finding of death.

The Agency has the authority to make such statement.
The BEC could accept the statement
atement as sufficient grounds
but would probably require a half-yearly
prolonging its validity

Anticipated problem
catement
BEC will require proof of relationship
between the deceased or missing and the beneficiary
which may not be available or procurable in all
cases.
b. The BEC has a base salary rate of $240
minimum which is a higher rate than many of the
present payments.
c. If the BEC allocation on the other hand
were lower, we could "construct" a salary to up the
payment over $240.
d. Whatever the rate of GARCIA LINES payments
they are based on legal maritime compensation rates

The survivor beneficiary in a student

Operational: Subject was first contacted by a JMWAVE
case officer in Miami during July 1960. The last of several
missions to Cuba, dating back to 9 December 1960, was the
infiltration by JMWAVE on approximately 1 May 1962. Subject
was arrested on 29 May 1962 and executed on 30 August 1962.
c. Other: Subject was a friend of Manuel ARTIME prior
to early 1959 when Subject joined ARTIME to form the Rural
Commands. Subject resumed contact with ARTIME following
Subject's arrival in Miami in 1960. Re the ARTIME claim in
Reference B that the mother of Subject is in bad health, there
is nothing in the filo regarding the mother's health, but
but
was in
is made of an aunt, Mrs. Eloisa CASTELLANO Rosales, who mention
J. 4.
bad health due to liver trouble. According to JMWAVE traces
Mrs. CASTELLANO entered the U.S.A. on 3 July 1963 (A13319405).
In summary, it is notod that Subject was considered as a valuable
asset during the period of his service However, it is believed
that the dependents have been well-paid according to JMWAVE
policy, and there is no record of their dissatisfaction with
the final settlement. It is further noted that a close and
long-time association existed between Subject and Manuel ARTIME
source of the current request for financial assistance to the
dependents.
3. Jorge FUNDORA (Hero and Martyr). Reference is made to
paragraph 2.B. of Reference B which is concerned with the possible
increase of payment to the widow, Silvia HEREDIA. There is nothing
t
in JMWAVE records to indicate that Subject ever worked for WOFACT.
However, the original AMBUD arrangement for designation of dependents
eligible for benefit payments resulted in the addition of certain
non-WOFACT cases to the payment rolls. Further, a review of the
original HEW questionnaire shows that Mrs. HEREDIA declared her total
income to be the $175.00 a month AMBUD payment. No mention was made
of additional income from the MRR. Unloss Headquarters has information
not available to JMWAVE, we strongly recommend no increase in payments
be made.
4 Francisco ECHEVERRIA Texier is the Subject of paragraph 2.C.,
Reference B. There is nothing in JMWAVE records to indicate that
Subject was ever employed by WOFACT. Unless Headquarters has
additional information regarding this case it is recommended that
payments not be initiated to the wife

Returned, under separate crence A.
to ANTIKI letters forwarded in Reference
letter
ANTIKI- for retention,
The 30 November letter sent to Trustee of Case No. 127
requested information concerning the mother of deceased (para-
graph 2(a), Reference A). According to Case No. 123 study
forwarded in Reference C, only the widow and an unidentified
child were listed as dependents. The Trustee denied the exis-
tence of any child in her original letter to AMTIKI, and
Reference D authorized the Station to terminate payment for
this child. Deceased'z 201 file contains bio data which identifies
the mother as reported, but does not reflect she was designated
as a dependent. Apparently, information is available at the
Station which indicates the mother is the rightful second depen-
dont. Clarification of this case is requested in order that
Headquarters data may coincide with that recorded at JMAVE.
3. Headquarters wishes to express appreciation for the
extremely valuable biographic data forwarded to date which
essential for the now completed WUMUTUAL actuary study. The
results of this study will be incorporated in recommendations
for future financing of this operation which will be submitted
to Higher Authority for approval in the immediate future.

PRESUMABLY, THE PROCEEDS OF THIS DEATH BENEFIT PAYMENT
HAS BEEN EXHAUSTED BY THE MOTHER'S MEDICAL EXPENSES.
HEADQUARTERS DOES NOT FEEL THAT THE DEATH BENEFIT PAYMENT
SHOULD NECESSARILY PRECLUDE FURTHER FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE
TO DEPENDENTS OF A FORMER VALUABLE AGENT IF IT CAN BE
PROVEN THEY WILL BE DESTITUTE AFTER THE TERMINATION OF
THE MONTHLY MRR PAYMENTS. THE INVESTIGATOR SHOULD DETERMINE
THE PRESENT FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THESE PEOPLE, INCLUDING
THE INCOME OF THE FATHER AND ANY CASH ASSETS, THEIR PRESENT
SCALE OF LIVING, THE PHYSICAL CONDITION OF BOTH INDIVIDUALS,
AND THE MINIMUM AMOUNT REQUIRED FOR LIVING EXPENSES AND
PERMANENT MEDICAL CARE ARTIME CLAIMS THE MOTHER REQUIRES.
THIS INVESTIGATION IS EXTREMELY URGENT IN ORDER THAT A
RECOMMENDATION FOR PAYMENT OF FUNDS, OVER AND ABOVE THE
THE DEATH BENEFIT, MAY BE SUBMITTED FOR SPECIAL APPROVAL.

B. SILVIA HEREDIA WIDOW OF JORGE FUNDORA, WHO
PARTICIPATED IN INFILTRATION OPERATIONS BOTH BEFORE AND

ACCORDING TO ARTIME, SUBJECT IS UNDER PSYCHIATRIC TREAT-
MENT, WHICH IS ALSO REFLECTED IN REFERENCE CASE STUDY, AND
HAS BEEN RECEIVING $125 PER MONTH FROM THE MRR TO HELP

3. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THE SAME INVESTIGATIVE FACILITIES
