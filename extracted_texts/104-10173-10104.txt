On February 21, 1966, PEDRO ZARATE MARMOLEJO,
Commandant of the Customs Guard, Maritime Customs. Office,
Mazatlan, Sinaloa, advised that his men have been carefully
watching the elements of the Soviet whaling fleet that are
currently visiting Mazatlan. They have been alerted to the
importation of any propaganda or contraband, but, as yet,
nothing has transpired. When the flagship of the Soviet whaling
fleet arrived recently, there was no one aboard who spoke
Spanish or English, and the Captain seemed to be completely
lacking in instructions about documents in order to enter the
harbor. He did not have the necessary papers prepared.
Soviet Embassy official was sent from Mexico City in order to
straighten matters out.
ZARATE said that the purpose of the visit of the
whaling ships was to take on fresh water and supplies. The
crews were also given liberty.
Also enclosed herewith for reference are copies of
the crew list of the Soviet vessel "Iskatel" which visited
Mazatlan on January 9, 1966.
In connection with the visit of the "Iskatel," it
is noted that a Soviet Embassy car, believed to contain Soviet
Commercial Consul GEORGIY STEPHANOVICHIVISKO and USSR Embassy
chauffeur VASILIY STEPHANOVICH MIROSHNIKOV, was observed on
the highway leading to Mazatlan on January 11, 1966, and was
subsequently observed on January 14, 1966, in Mazatlan.
This office is attempting to obtain the crew list
of the Soviet whaling vessels that have visited Mazatlan during.
February, 1966, and will make them available when obtained.

Dr. Ernst GOEBEL,

1. Upon receipt of POA on Subject, I called him at his
office (Auxiliar de la Construccion, SA, Holbein 168, tél:
43-31-36) on 11 March 1965 and made an appointment to see him
at 1800 on 14 March at the office. Since I had met him
socially in the fall of 1965, he remembered me which facilitated
the contact.
2. I met with him from 1800 to 1835 at his office. He took
me to a back office where we conducted the conversation. I
stated my business briefly - that I knew LOGINOV was a member
of the French Club and I desired information about his activities.
and contacts at the club. He was in immediate agreement to help
me in any way he could. I have him LOGINOV's full name, physical
description, type and license plate of his car and showed him
pictures of LOGINOV and his wife.
3. Subject said that he had not seen LOGINOV at the club
nor heard his name. He is sure that LOGINOV is not a tennis.
player which is Subject's only occupation at the club. Subject
said the only goes there on Saturday afternoons and Sunday
mornings to play tennis. However, his wife often goes during
the week with the children. Subject agreed that both he and
his wife would look out for LOGINOV. At my suggestion he agreed
to make inquiries about LOGINOV from Club employees such as
the manager or the bar tender who know everybody. He agreed to
mask his interest by stating only he had heard that à Russian
was a member and to express normal curiosity about this unusual
fact.
Subject immediately agreed to my request that this
subject be a matter of strictest confidence between himself,
his wife and me (his wife is an American citizen whom I have met
and on whom we also have a POA). As I was leaving and thanking
him for his cooperation, he expressed his appreciation in the
confidence that I had in him in a matter of this nature.

5. Towards the end of the conversation he asked if I
worked with Al White at the Embassy. I said "no, but I know
him. He answered, "of course, you would be with counter-

He did not appear to be the least suspicious about Allan. He
said he knew him through their wives (cancer work) and the
children and remarked that Allan speaks pretty good German.
Other than his telling me that I work in counter-intelligence
he did not ask any questions about my position in the Embassy.
Subject made a very good impression; direct, businesslike
and no nonsense. He said that he would call me in tow or three
weeks to advise the results of his investigation.

places he had been in Latin America.

DATE OF MEETING:
Nick KOURCHENKO, Jr.
7. June 1966
1. I met Nick at his apartment from 2030 to 2200 in
order to debrief him on the fishing weekend of 3-5 June.
2. Nick reported that when he and his Mexican friend
arrived at Pucuato at 1845 on Friday, 3 June, YATSKOV and
two other Soviets were already there fishing in front of the
cabins. They had come in ISAYEV's VW. Shortly thereafter
the Soviets came to the cabins and Nick greeted YATSKOV and
introduced his Mexican friend to him. YATSKOV did not introduce
the other two Soviets by name but they all did shake hands.
Nick invited them all into his room but only YATSKOV came.
He accepted a drink and left with it. Later outside Nick
asked one of the new Soviets his name and got the answer,
"Vasilio." The other one then used an English word and Nick
asked if he spoke English. This Soviet said his name was
Viktor and that he spoke a little English. Nick then asked
YATSKOV which of the other two was the newly arrived Soviet.
YATSKOV said that it was Viktor. Nick then lent them his.
extra lantern and that ended things for the night.
+
=
3. The next day both groups fished separately at
Sabanita. About noon-YATSKOV came by and noticed that Nick
was having luck so he brought the other two Sovs to a spot
immediately adjacent. They stayed about an hour, didn't
have any luck and left. They met again that evening at the
cabins. Nick and his friend had caught 28 trout and the Soviets
none. YATSKOV was upset, jealous and even angry. Nick then
invited Viktor in for a drink. Viktor did the same as YATSKOV,
took the drink with him. YATSKOV said that the Soviets would
leave Sunday morning since they had no luck. Nick left
early Sunday morning for fishing. He later learned from the
owner that the Soviets had left fairly early Sunday morning.

2.
.6. ISAYEV asked what his fishing plans were. Nick said
that he was so busy with his many problems at the new plant that
he would not be going fishing during June. Nick then suggested
that they go on the weekend of 1 July. However, he added "but
just you and me. Don't bring any of your friends like that rude
Pablo (YATSKOV)." ISAYEV answered "Not even Anatoliy (KARABACH?"
Nick answered that Anatoliy was okay and he could come. This
date is tentative and will be confirmed.
1
7. ISAYEV remarked zhat his wife and child were in
Cuernavaca and that KARABACH's wife would go down on the weekend
of 18 June leaving them both bachelors. Nick facetiously
remarked that he would have to organize some wome: for them.
8 Nick asked ISAYEV about the Soviet volleyball team.
ISAYEV said that he had been heavily engaged in working with them.
He was with the team for each game, then went out with them to
dinner, took them to the hotel, etc. and didn't get home nights
until 1am.
-
9. Nick brought up the point that ISAYEV had never invited
him to his house. ISAYEV, definitely uncomfortable and searching
for words, said that he hadn't invited them because his wife
thought that there was too big a contrast between Nick's home
and theirs. That Nick was "rich" with lots of beautiful things
that they lived very modestly having inherited undistinguished
furniture from his predecessor, etc. Nick pooh-poohed this.
stating that friendship is what counts and the circumstances
of one's home meant nothing. ISAYEV ended by saying rather
gamely that he would invite Nick to his home. Nick said that
from ISAYEV's. words and discomfiture, it was obvious that he
is ashamed to invite anyone to his house.
-
"
10. Finally, Nick said that it was his impression that
ISAYEV had absolutely no immediate plans to return to the USSR
and Nick feels that he will be here until November or December.

Subject immediately identified the passport photo of

4. Subject reported that on 13 June ISAYEV called him at
home and asked to come by that evening. (Confirmed by LIENVOY).
ISAYEV arrived about 1930 and stayed to about 2030. Subject
suggested that they have a Martini
they have a Martini. ISAYEV said that he had
never had one and was interested in the ingredients and how it
was put together. However, after he had drunk half, Subject
noted that he obviously did not like it. Therefore, Subject:

of this combination was the first time Subject has seen ISAYEV

5. ISAYEV said that he had heard that Subject had had

Vodka in front of Nick and his friend, refusing to come to Nick's
for a drink or inviting Nick and his friend in, anger at Nick's
success, etc). ISAYEV merely
ISAYEV merely shrugged this off. Nick then
mentioned that he had met the new man "Viktor," (BOYAROV),
had spoken a few words of English with him and thought he was
very nice.
ISAYEV answered that although "Viktor" was not a
fisherman, he had enjoydd seeing the Mexican countryside and
particularly the scenery at Pucuato. They did not discuss the
third Soviet, "Vasilio.

4. Although all the Soviets were pleasant and correct
there was absolutely no socializing or extended conversation.
They did not accept Nick's invitations to come in for a
drink, except for the above noted occasions when they accepted
a drink and left taking it with them.
5. "Viktor:" Nick described him as an older man, 36
to 42, medium height, 82-85 kilos, heavy but not fat build,
roundish, boyish face, looked like an American in general
appearance. Does not speak Spanish. Said he spoke a little
English. However, their conversation was so limited that Nick
couldn't determine his fluency. He obviously understood.
"everything that Nick said but his answers and comments were
short and simple. Ás noted above, YATSKOV said that he is
the newly arrived Soviet. He did not do any fishing himself
but simply watched YATSKOV and the other Soviet.
'
.6. I showed Nick a picture of BOYAROV. Nick couldn't
positively identify it. Our picture has sunglasses. During
the day Viktor had on a white towel protecting his neck and
a wide hat but no sunglasses. At night Nick saw very little
of him and it was dark. However, Nick did say that our photo
was not at all incompatible with Viktor. Also showed him a
photo of GAZIYEV and he said that this was definitely not
Viktor. (COMMENT: Since GAZIYEV and BOYAROV are the only
new Soviets in town, and Viktor spoke English, he has to be
BOYAROV. But why did he use the name Viktor when his name
is Vitally?'
"Vasilio" About 28-32 years old, medium to dark
blond curly hair, medium height, very good athletic build,
tough and strong appearance, the all-American boy type.
Speaks pretty good Spanish but not as well as ISAYEV or YATSKOV.
There are only two Vasiliys at the Embassy, BUTSEV and
MIROSHNIKOV, but neither comes any where near the above
description. (COMMENT: Nick's description of "Vasilio" fits
LOGINOV to a "T." However, his name is Valentin and not
Sasiliy. I will show Nick pictures at the next meeting.):
Previously Nick has met 8 Soviets, all in true name
(mostly by first name only). Thus it is strange that BOYAROV
and LOGINOV should use phony names.

On 2 May 1966 Subject called me and asked for a meeting which
took place at his office from 1530 to 1600 the same day
ingan
Subject reported that on Saturday, 16 April he saw LOGINOV
his wife and son leaving the French Club at ca 1500. He noticed that another
car, 25 DA (GORLITSYN's) was parked next to LOGINOV's, half an hour
later 25 DA was still there, which meant that its owner had something to do
with the Club Independent of LOGINOV. I showed Subject pictures of COREÏTSYN
which he Immediately identified as the Soviet who was with LOGINOV the first
time Subject saw him at the Club. (comment: Since this makes two times that
GORLITSYN has been at the Club, perhaps he is also a member.) -

3. Subject reported that on Sunday, 24 April he and another member,
Antonio SARMIENTO, were looking for a fourth to play doubles. Subject
noticed LOGINOV standing beside the tennis court and asked SARMIENTO to
Invite LOGINOV to join them. However, LOGINOV declined and sald that he
was going to have a swim with SARMIENTO's wife. After lunch Subject saw
LOGINOV and SARMIENTO playing chess together and overheard that they
are on a first-name basis. From the above Subject commented that LOGINOV
and the SARMIENTOs have a close social relationship.
4. Subject knows SARMIENTO casually as an occasional tennis
companion, SARMIENTO owns a plastic factory which makes airline bags
and similar items. He is about 35. His wife's name is Violeta and she is

11 May 1200, Subj's office,

was too limited for the operator, and thus the examination was postponed to

to 60 on record, in any event, for believing that the timing
not apropriate for subjecting Subj to the COUTER. Subj had been led over
led˝over
poriod of months up to the point where he carried out a
Fried out a break-off from the
Soviets re clandestine work for them Just the samo day he had been scheduled
for the examination, 3 May, he had a scene with his old Soviet case officor,
Prikhodko, and no mattor what aplomb Subj has (and he has plenty) Subj finds
the break-off scones emotionally wearing. Hence, to have sprung an LCFLUTTER
on him at this timo, ho may have boon inordinately sensitive to a feeling the
we mistrusted him - coming as it did after our adamant stand that he out loose
from the Soviets. The risk of affronting Subj by an LCFLUTTER was not, in the
C.O.'s opinion, worth it at this particular stage of relationships in the
operation.
"
P
On 11 Kay Subj reported that on 10 May at about 1630 Valentin Loginov
came to his office. Loginov asked Subj if he knew anything about the Congress
of Intellectuals that was going to take place in Mexico. Loginov said that
the Congross, whose tople was Anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union, was really
anti-Soviet. He brought Subj a pamphlet in Spanish "The Jews in the Soviet
Union" (printed by the Soviet Embassy in Mexico) - (attached). Subj did some
fast thinking, because he in reality had booked the hotel reservations for
the group that was to attend the Congross He told Loginov that he had handled
the hotel reservations at the Hotel Del Prado. When Loginov asked for the
naces of the delegatos, Subj daja he didn't know them.
Earlier that day Subj had seen Izraeli Anb Arad, and the Congress had been
a topic of discussion between them. Arad had said that some news media, specifically
El Dia, Politica, and Siemre, had criticised the Congress as being anti-Soviet.
The Israeli Embassy actually was supporting the Congress, but for policy reasons
had to remain in the background. An Israeli, named Tov, was in Mexico promoting
the Congress, but he was not associated with the Israeli Embassy. Arad feared
there might be leftist interruption of the Congress, scheduled to take place at

and wanted to remain there. His card read, "Director of International Organizations",

24.May.
Subj also mentioned that the INURIST delegation coming to the AAV mooting
in Guadalajara (27-30 Apr); had not arrived in Mexico as scheduled (on 19 Apr)
because there had boon a delay in their receiving Mexican visas. The delay
was occasioned by mexican demand for minimal bio ruphic information in order
to process the visas. The group of four has been re-scheduled to arrive in
Moxico on 23 Arr via Sabeña..
The C.O. saw the exchange of telerrana re the information required for visa
issuance, and notedth the followings
Viktor Batchenko, born 21 July 1925 in uninsk; president of INTURIST, Passport
D 01155 B, issued 6 Oct 1965.

Subj mentioned that at the Copenhagen Congress on Congress Organizations
that he attended 30 ar to 2 Apr 1966, he met two Soviet "scientists” and
the INFURIST rep for Denmark. The representatives from the Academy of Sciences"
were Gennadiyi Andreyevich Kozhaev and Timur T. Timofejev (cards attached).

The following day, 14 Apr, Loginov came to Subj's office. He naked Subý how
istrip (to Europe) had been and specifically asked if Subj and seon Ginetto
Pelccel Porter. Subf replied that he had found out that Ginette and her husband
vere vacationing in Italy.
Levinev äsked what impins Sub had received in fuego en France's bucking
out of NATO. Subjanowered that he had spoken to some benchsen, including
George Laguere of Air France, who considered in general that de Gaulle was not
wrong, but that his way was too drastic, that he was annoying everyone, and that
France could not be isolated.
Then Subj made his break-off announcement to Loginov, saving But- I'm sorry
to tollx you that I'm not going to be able to work with you any more Thero
aro séveral reasons. Loginov asked if anything had happened. Subj replied he
had reasons. Loginov asked what they were. Subj baid he was tired; he had a
lot to do; and frankly he was plain disappointed- thoro had been big deals
planned, nothing happened, and he was doing just junk. Loginov asked if that
was subj'a final decisión. Subj said yea. Tho Soviot then asked if they could
talk it over. Subj said certainly, any time. Whereupon it was agreed between
thom that they would mot half an hour before the expected arrival at Lexico
Airport of the INTURIST p coring to lexico. They would meet in the restaurant.
Subj told Lominov he had traveled with Ano Dazarov, and that they had become
ho
very friendly. And he asked Loginov is he minded that he saw the Amb again.
Loginov said not at all- but not to call the inb at the Sovemb or use the phone
for any calls to the Sovmb.

As stated in para. 1 above, the INTURIST delegation did not arrive on 19
Anr, and Subj who knew of the postronement did not go to the airport, and
consequently missed his meet with Loinov.
3. Subj, in his customary way asked "did I do right?" The C.O. said it was
fine if Loginov cot the no-nonsense idea that Subj was through. The C.O. told
Subj to wait until the Sovs cet in touch with him again, and to have their
second meet, at which Subj again makes perfectly clear that he is through. Ho

1. At 08:00 hours I had a telephone call from the Secretary
of Gobernacion, Lic. Luis Echevarria. He salf that he had an urgent
matter in which he needed my help. He added that this was a matter
that President Gustavo Diaz Ordaz, was personally very interested.
2. Echevarria sent Lienvoy/2 to see me and gave me the follow-
ing information and asked the following help of me.
a). President Diaz Ordas is personally very "upset" by
certain recent actions by some Soviets in Mexico. (Note: I
believe, but do not know this, that some Soviet has tried to
"recruit" a source close to the President and that this has.
"backfired").
b). ValentinaAQUINO, Soviet (now KGB) is of partic-
ular and urgent interest interest to the President. I waś
told by Echevarria on the telephone that the top name on the
list he would send by Lienvoy/ would probably get the same
treatment that soms others get in 1959". "This refers to PNG
actions taken in March 1959 against two, Soviets caught, with
Demetric VALLEJO Vartirez and the Railroad Strikers. I was ask-
ted if I cfuld send two things to Echevarria urgently: These arei

Besides the 11 April olip on Dr. Juan Lui's ALVAREZ Gallou

least related if not the same person. This is the only name on which
other
there are any/possibly identifiable traces:
(1) According to a 28 June 1961 LITEA Contact Report,
Jose Luis ALVAREZ was one of the students in the Tuesday
and Thursday, 7 to 8:30 p. m., Russian language classes at
the IICMR during the months of February and March.
(2)
i
-6018, dated 17 November 1961, based on information
from LIENVOY thit C, reported that one Jose Luis ALVAREZ was
a member of the MLN Committee of Michoa can
(3) In a 30 November 1961 Legal Attache report one
Jose Luis ALVAREZ of Morelia, Michoacan, was named as one who
_
assisted the National Liberation Movement in Naxico.
(4) HAMA-20610, dated 1 March 1963, included the following
information from LIBRI FORM: "One Jose-Luis ALVAREZ-(matronymic
unknown) is putting items in the 'Voz de la Universidad! (Univer-
sidad Autonora Nacional de Mexico) for the Czechs. KUBATA,
the Charge d'Affaires in the Czech Embassy praised ALVAREZ

for his reports and said 'we will give you money and material
to help support the magazine'. ALVAREZ also works on the
University's 'Feriodico de la Universidad'¨(newspaper).

Contact Report/. LICCEY-5
25 Juno 113041215, Subj's office
1
In response to a call-in by Suby, the 0.0. wont to aes Suby on Saturity
morning 25 June.
2. Subj reported that Valentin Reginov had dropped in to the office on 24 Juno
to make arrangements for a return trip to the Soviet Union for (Nicolai) Leonov,
rhö, Legincy said, had to be in Moscow at the latest 4 July. Subj said ho
would try to handle. /Comments forinov said he would come by the office on
27 Juno with Leonov's passport, because there was the liklihood that Subj
would attempt to got a K flight for Eschov via Houston (requiring a U.S. visa
for Iconov). In any event, Subj told the C.O. that he was not going to the
U.S. Intacsy to request the visa, but would buck the whole problem to XIII who
would have to make tny visa arrangements that were required/.
1
3. Interestingly enough, Loginov took the opportunity to bring up operational
matters again to Subj, and Subj used the ensuing discussion to make his stance
utterly clear to Loginov. The conversation went more or lesp as follows:
Loginov said: "You're mad at me. " Subj said: "Why should I be ried at you?"
Logitov caid: “Because of Majestic" (referring to the fact that the Sovs had
first given a travel request to Viajes Kajestic to be serviced).. You' lator wo
have to spread it around among friends" Subj shrugged this off. Then Loginov
asked: "Are you still mad?"
i
Subj replied: "I'm not mad, and I never was. Look, Valentin- " (and then
ho made his first attempt at clarification, saying in effect that in normal
friendly matters they wore like brothers; Sub exaggerated as is his manner-
mentioning intimate matters like "marriage" and "even unto death (hasta la muerte)"
but saying that that was the culmination point- "anything else" was finished).
Loginov said (without batting an era): "I had some business for you."
Subj cut him shorts "Don't bring me anything- important or not important- you
can keep it. You want to go for coffee; you want to go out with girls; - with
much pleasure; cything up to that point. And I want you to understand that
¨ clearly. Don't force mo; and let's be good friends.". Loginov' saids. "You're
getting difficult."
Subj replied: "No, I'm not difficult. And there's no damage. I made my
and your chiefs will understand my position."

to Ofelia ALFARO Lopez (P-11339) friend of Antonio SARMIENTO (P-12703)
and his wife, Violeta. Both Ofelia ALFARO and LOGINOV attended a
Christmas party at the SARMIENTO's last year (pertinent clips included
with the Gloria ALFARO material attached). In the 22 June 66 conversation
Gloria ALFARO had with LOGINOV she mentions having met him at Christmas

LOGINOV. I have included copies of them also.

Loginos tried again: "A good friend of yours was appointed Chief of the
U.S. Travel Service - Paul Giedre- ho'o a fricii of yours?"
Subj became a little heated in reply: "Yes, he's a good friend. I will
always be close to him. But you get this very clear- any plans you have for
Paul Cicare, forget about them, is that clear? I won't do a goddam thing. I
hope you understand that. We're friendz (you and I), but beside. being friends-

Loginov took out a piece of paper and started to read from it, asking
Subj if he knew the man "Eduardo Wetelmin approximately 55 years old- a Nexica
Jes." (Attached is a photocory of the piece of paper Loginov had been reading,
and which he left behind on Subj's dock apparently by mistake. It's in Russian,
and Subj was not able to translate completely at first glance. Subj plans to
return the original to Logincy when he comes by on 27 June.) While Loginov was
reading, Subj said insistently: " I don't know the man, and I'm not going to do
anything ..." Loginov replied. "I'm not asking you to do anything
it's just'
that I don't know (about him). About Paul Giedro, he's a good friend of yours...
Subj said: "Forget it."
-
4. Subj asked the C.O. "did I do wrong?" The C.O. replied that Subj had tano
besutifully, but he has to expect that the Sovs will keep up all kinds of
pressures subtle, small, or even great, and not so subtle. But the way is clear-
all he has to do is say "no."
Subj said that Loginov had brought him a box of "Punch" cigars (Cubor), and
Sub de usual offered to pay, but Loginov pressed them on him. Subj then said
to the C.O. he wanted an expression of policy on hom he should handle that kind-
of thing from the Sovs- take the gifts, after offering to pay? refuse outright?
The 0.0. said we would give the guidance he needed for that situation.
5. The C.o. will drop around to Subj's office early next wock.
Addendum: the C10. told Subj that there was a rumor that Oleg Nechi porenko
was seen around town. Subj said no knew of nothing on that score, but doubted
it strongly since he was sure Oleg would have contacted him. The C.O. under-
scored that Subj do nothing about the rumor.

MEMO FOR RECORD
11 Aug 66
his monthly report for August 1966, LICALLA said. YATSKOV seam
have taken PRIKHUIKO's place. When I asked why he thought that,
answered:
PRIKHONKO is not here (he left 28 June on home leave). PRIKHODKO had
been entering the massy through the main door and was seen working in
window # 22. Now YATEKOV is entering through the main door and was
seen working at this window. YATSKOV also had the same contact with
NIKIFOROV which PRIKHODRO had previously hed. Now that YATSKOV has
also left (4 Aug), LICALLA thinks that LOGINOV is probably taking his
place. (This last statement is not clear, whether LOGINOV is takias
YATSKOV's place in ATXOV's old job, which would be most logical. Or
whether LICALLA thinks LOGIROV may now be in the PRIKHOKO job. In any
cane, PHIKHOIKO himself should be back momentarily.)

in to tell me he was ready.. We shut up the store, got into the
car and drove to my house: We parked the car in the street and
entered my house. Once inside the first thing they did was to
inspect the hoise in great detail even the "azotea". I think
that the house pleased them. They made me show them everything
including the bathroom and bedrooms. Then we sat at the table
to drink tequila (la copa) and beer. My wife served barbecued:

to the latter. first Bubject said no, then yes that he had asked
Silnikov about it but Bilnikov said that the negative didn't belong to him
but to Vasilly who took it back to Moscow with him. Subject added that Vasilly
had returned to the USSR about two weeks ago. (Comments This is most probably
BUTSEV whom Subject calls Vasilly and who returned to the USSR on 24 July.)
(Second Comments This is another example of one of Silnikov's vulnerabilities
evaporating into thin air).

8. In discussing SILNIKOV's recent work fixing up the Embassy I asked
who actually did the work. Subject said that the Soviets do not like to deal
with established firms for repairs to the Embassy because they charge too
much. They prefer to deal with small independent people whom they can beat
down on the price. Subject knows of two such individuals:

The C/O reminded Subj of what he basically was in Soviet eyes - an Eastern
Europour refugee said a Jon. And more, he had never professed to them any ideological
sympathy to the Communist cause. The rost he had done was to declare that the
Soviets represented the wave of the future, and he wanted to be on the winning side.
but he must recognise that such sortiment coming from a Jew could hardly have
convinced the Soviets.
b) Next stare of arrrcach to Soviets in Mexicos
The C/O suggested to Subj as an effective way to break off from the Soviets
that he should drop complotely

"hasta la muerte" bit. Subj, in turning down any and all Soviet requests for
information or assistance, should couple it with the open declaration that he has
quit.
Subj agreed to follow this line, except for the qualification pertaining to
his presence in Hoscow.
c) Clarify status of Loginov as "Consul"
11712
Subj daid that during his meet with Prikhodko and Loginov on 8 September 1966
while they were talking about Pavel Yatskov, whom Prikhodko said he had seen in
oscow, Subj addressed the following question to Loginova when is your boss
coming back? Loginov replied: "You're talking now to the Consul.
The C/O wished to clarify or reaffirm his understanding of Subj's response

the C/O paraphrased for Suby the way he had reported Subj's reasoning proocas

Subj said that it was essentially correct.
Then tho C/O related the way he had reported Prikhecko's question and Subj's

7 Sept, a few minutes, Sears Ejercito Nacional
8 Sept, 1100-1200, Subj's office
8 September 1966
1. On 7 Sept at about 1100 the C/O made a routine call to Subj's office to determine
if. Subj would be available that day. Subj responded that he was glad that the C/O
-
had called because he had to see him urgently. In characteristic manner Subj trying,
=
=
doubletalk told the C/O that he had received a telegram, that his old friend (Prikhodko)
was back, and that he was going to see the "two of them" (Prikhodko and Loginov)
1500 that day at the Flor de Mexico. The C/O was puzzled by the reference to the
telegram, and asked incredulously if the telegram had anything to do with setting:
up the meeting with his friends. Subj's answer was ambiguous, and the C/O let it
go at that because he arranged a brief meet with Subj for 1230 at Sears Restaurant,
at Ejercito Nacional, where Subj was to be on his own business at that time.
2. Nevertheless, in considering the briefing instruction to give to Subj the c/o
had to allow for the fact that there might have been special circumstances in
the Sovieta' arrangement for their meet with Subj. Further, this was Prikhodko's
first meet with Subj after return from Moscow, where it is presumed he had taken
up Subj's case with his superiors and the line decided on how to deal in the future
with their flaging, non-cooperative "agent." A reasonable contingency expectation
was that the Soviets might have
a "hot" proposition to make to Subj, and the C/O
decided to brief Subj to the extent that if the Soviets broached a really important
operational assignmont, which Subj was to judge, Subj would conduct himself so as
to draw out the Soviets but stall on acceptance. If nothing of overriding importance
camo from the Soviots, Subj was to continue his friends-yes; work-no" stance
123
485
n
At 1230 the C/O saw Subj for just a few minutes, during which the telegram
was explained it was from Moscow, inviting Subj's travel agency to participate
seminar in Moscow 24-29 Oct 1966, detailed letter to follow. Further, Subj
had learned from Prikhodko when the latter had called earlier in the morning to
make the appointment for the meet that afternoon that Prikhodko was aware of the
1
Invitation and would talk to Subj about it at their meet The C/O imparted to
Subj the briefing outlined above, stressing that Subj must judge whether the
Soviots were proposing something that was so important that he couldn't dismis
it out of hand - in which case he was to be non-committal and stall on a decision
3. The C/O had communicated to the Station the tack he was going to take, and
was later informed by the Station to reverse the planning of Subj's attitude toward
a contingency proposition of the Soviets to a flat, unconditional "no."

CONTACT REPORT
SUBJECT:
Ernst GOEBEL
DATE OF MEETING:
8 September 1966
1. I met with Subject at his office on 8 September 1966
from 1730 to 1800. Next meeting is in about two weeks to be
arranged by phone.
1-7
Subject reported that LOGINOV still comes fairly
regularly to the French Club on weekends. Occasionally he brings
his wife. Once or twice he brought two young Soviet men in
their early twenties. He has also brought a Soviet woman ca
25 who has played tennis with two other women (club members)
whom Subject doesn't know Subject hasn't seen GORLITSYN since
our last meeting.
1
3. Since LOGINOV doesn't play tennis but only sits around
outside or in the bar, Subject doesn't see him for sustained
periods Subject has seen LOGINOV talking to SARMIENTO or his
wife two or three times. From observing him in the bar, Subject
saw that LOGINOV is on speaking terms with several members.
asked Subject if he know Ofelia
a good friend of the SARMIENTOS and also in contact with the
Soviets. He didn't recognize her name as a club member When
School of Economics, he
I told him that she teaches at the FARO Lopez (P-11339):

remembered that at a dinner party at the home of Henry *SIEGMANN
an American and local head of Continental Oil Co., a Mexican
woman was present who was a professor of Economics. She speaks
excellent English and is in her thirties. He thinks this is
ALFARO but is not sure He will check his wife who is the name
rememberer in the family.
25.

-
5 Subject remarked that he found the above dinner strange
for its odd mixture of solid bussness types and a few off-beat
"beatnik" Mexican types including the female professor. He
hastened to assure me that SIEGMANN was a sterling character.
111
6. For the next meeting Subject will attempt to confirm
ALFARO's identity and also to spot likely club members who
appear to be on close terms with the SARMIENTOS with the view
of getting an assessment of the latter
14
7. Subject is interested and willing. However, he does
not appear to be very much interested in people. Thus he has
played tennis with SARMIENTO for years and hasn't a thing to
say about him except that he is a pleasant tennis companion.
Similarly SARMIENTO's wife is good looking and a good tennis player.
8. I haven't had an opportunity to talk to Subject's wife
yet because Subject says that she does not know the SARMIENTOS.
I met his wife last fall and noted that she is much more alert,
interested and lively in social relations than he is. Therefore
I bet that she knows a lot more than he gives her credit for.
I intend to invite them to dinner soon in order to talk with the
wife and explore possibilities.

Accordingly, the C/O tried to reach Subj at his office. Subj was not there
so the C/O left a message to be given to Subj if he should arrive before 1500.
The message wası " En el negocio con sus amigos deberia usted decir "no" a todo."
The message purported to come from "Señor. Berger."
13
In a telephone call to Sub at 1800 that evening the C/O learned from Sudj.
that nothing of transcending importance had occurred at his meet with the Sovieta,
nil received
and so the c/o arranged to meet with Subf the following day 8 September. ***
4. On 8 Sept Subj reported that he had met Prikhodko and Loginov at 1500 the
preceding day in the Flor de Mexico Restaurant. Prikhodko did most of the talking.
He brought Subj the two kilos of caviar that Subj had requested (and paid for).
He said he had had a good leave in the Soviet Union, and that the wedding (of his
son) had gone off all right. He had spoken with Nechi porenko (who is still in Moscow
and with the Ministry of Foreim Affairs) who sent his regards to Subj and also four
Russian records. He had seen Pavel Yatakov in Moscow who told him that he had met
Subj in Paris. Yatskov would be returning to Hoxico about 17 September 1966. Either
Prikhddko or Loginov told Subj that loginov was now the Soviet Consul in Mexico
Loginov told Subj that he would pass by Subj's office on Monday (12 Sept).
C'le
They discussed the invitation to the travel agents to come to Moscow.
Prikhodko
said that twelve INTURIST representatives in Mexico had been invited, that he had
the telegram and that he was going to coordinate the arrangements for the travel
agenta to attend the conference. /Comments The telegram sent to Subj in Spanish on
6 September 1966 said: "there will be a conference 24- 29 October in Moscow of
travel agencies that collaborate with INTURIST dealing with international tourism;
we invite your agency; a reduced price for the stay will be afforded; a detailed
letter follows." Prikhodko asked Subj if he thought of attending the conference
Subj said ho would like to go (and added with
(and added with a twinkle) - "only from
"only from a business
sturdroint."
Prikhodko, for his part, in thin reference to Subj'a uncooperative attiture
said that Subj had put him into a hard spot with his superiors in Moscow. And now
ne would have to consult with Moscow to see whether Subj can attend the travel agent
conference. Subj asked archly "By letter" Prikhodko replied "You're crazy-
everything goes by cable." Subj stated "You can refuse me a visa." Prikhodko
dismissed that, saying that if Subj goes to Moscow he will ha meet Prikhodko‘a
colleagues, and that if Subj is in Moscow the doctors there would be happy to
check into Subj's health (a matter mentioned previously with both Loginov and
Prikhodko). Subj, responding somewhat mockingly to this expression of concern
by the Soviets, said he was still their friend and one of them.

/Comments Subj explained to the C/O that he sensed the trap immediately, recognizing
that this was the old bent of the Soviets on which he had furnished a wealth of
information in the past. Subj reasoned that if the Soviets were fishing with the
old bait, he would not rise to it eagerly because in view of his recent non
cooperative behavior it would only confirm to the Soviets that he was being
controlled (by the AIS). He would not reject the insinuation of his cooperation
out of hand and categorically, because that would not be consistent with his posture
of remaining on friendly tormo with the Sovieta. Therefore he took the middle road,
that of being non-committal or uncommitted, where the initiative of compliance was
always in his hands. Parenthetically, Subj told the C/O that if the "roller" is
that of complete rejection of the Soviets he should not have even met them; but
following the policy of "hasta la muerte- amigos, pero hacer nada" he felt he was
doing the right thing in stringing them along a barren path. Thus, without batting
an eye he simply repeated what he had already told them./ Subj said he would have
to coniult Gobornación- because he

capitalization to place a foreigner in a job but this being Mexico, anything could.

could not seriously consider using Subj's firm to "legalize" their man
because.
it would be a patent fraud to the employees in his firm, and he did not think the
Soviets were stupid about such things/.
The C/O's summary comment to Subj's unspoken plea for criticism of his course
of action was that under the concept of a "friends, yes; work, no" policy toward
the Soviets he was doing a fine job of walking the tightrope.
as a German Jem, and
to the Soviet Union.
14
5. The C/O asked Subj if there had been any travel arrangements for non-Soviets
to the Soviet Union. Subj replied that Julio Rothenstreich, whom Subj characterized
his wife, a Russian Jew, had left 5 Sept to New York en route
Subj said Rothenstreich had told him that he was friendly with
the Soviet Ambassador in Mexico and represented "Russian firms" (sic). He was to
remain in the Soviet Union 15 days and visit a few cities, Moscow, Kiev and folzgred=
and then some cities in Europe, Vienna and Paris. Subj said that Rothenstreich's

own firm was making the hotel reservations in the Soviet Union for him. Subj said
he had met once before with Rothenstreich years ago, but didn't know anything about
him.
*
Subj also mentioned a widower in his sixties, David Nonofsky, who left for
the Soviet Union on 1 Sep Rosefsky Mau & brother in Kiev.
6. The C/O had noticed a now face among Subj's employees and asked Subj who the
Girl was. Subj˝explained that he had taken on the new girl, Leticia Cisneros, the
daughter of one of Subj's guides in Moxico, as possible replacement for Miriam
Avila Kats, who has an offer to work for the Israeli Embassy in Mexico. Subj said
he would not want to lose Miriam because, even though she is a slow wórkér, she is
capable and also a nice girl. If Hirian should leave, Leticia would take over
her work (which includes the responsibility for non-Soviet travel to the Soviet Union).
7. The C/O questioned Subj about his attitude toward attending the travel agent
conference in l'oscow. Subj said that from a business standpoint he would want to
attend, or if not him personally someone from his firm, like Miriam. He was
interested in INTURIST business, and felt that he should know what plans INTURIST
will be formulating inasmuch as his competitors will be there. He is interested
to know what percentage he gota of INTURIST business. He believed that INTURIST
would foot 50% of the costs of staying in the Soviet Union during the conference.
The C/O asked if Subj knew the other travel agencies that were to be invited. Of the
twelve from Mexico Subj felt that the following were included Garza, Carza Tours,
De Carlo Tours, Viajes Kelia, Cook's, NexAmerica, Pegaso, Excursiones y Viajes (SVISA),
American Express, and possibly Autoviajes Internacionales. Subj knew the "jefes” of
all these.
-
Subj plans to attend the International Congress and Convention Association
meeting in Israel on 30 October 1966. He is considering the possibility of going
to Moscow for the travel agent meeting 24-29 Oot and then going on to Israel.
The C/O told Subj to let him know Prikhodko's results re permission for Subj
to attend the Moscow meeting.
8. Subj requested the C/O to obtain one case each of Red, White and Rosee French
wine, the "best" available.

his Statement was a bit indiscreet since he could have burned

in security measures. He said I was right but it was obvious

behavior about wanting, women, pornographic material, etc. in that
he raises and drops the subject without any sense of continuity.
Subject answered this by proposing that we send a girl under our
control to visit his store and he would introduce her to
SILVEKOV (Com Exactly what we are trying to do with LIRUSTIC-1)
I pointed out that such a girl would have to live in the neighbor
hood or her presence in the store would be suspect. He then said
that the girl could be invited to his home at a time when
SILNIKOV was there Subject would introduce her as a friend
from Jalisco and let nature take its course. I told him that his
idea has basic merit but could be quite difficult to implement
in a secure nanner. I remarked that it was a shame that he had
been unable to come up with suitable candidates in his neighborhood.

2. Subject started out by showing me 4 pieces of paper he
had picked up near the incinerator. They were worthless and I
later told him not to attempt to pick up any more paper since it
is not worth the risk.
3.
I then reviewed the SGSWIRL examination with him. I told
him that because of his lies and exaggerations, none of his peevious
information was considered valid and that rather than "being more
useful to us" his material had meant a lot of work for nothing. I
told him that I would give him another chance and that we were
starting a new operation. Throughout my talk he was quite un-
comfortable. He did not try to defend himself but simply agreed
to whatever I said. Although he thanked me for the second chance
he did not appear to be too contrite.

4. Following are the few interesting items from his notes
14
On 12 December at ca 1700 KORMUSHKIN came in with another
Soviet. KORMUSHKIN asked Subject when he was going to invité him
to his home for a drink Subject suggested Sunday, 18 December.
They agreed to meet at the store at 1500. Subject described the
other Soviet as a young diplomat ca 29-30 with a thin build who
comes in only seldom. He was a friend of Oleg NECHIPORENKO was
already here when NECHIPORENKO was here) and went to the fiesta
at Subject's home which was attended by NECHIPORENKO and KOSTIKOV
and wives. (COMMENT: I remember a report on this fiesta but can't
find it anywhere). Subject asked me for instructions, dinner, girls,
etc? I told him to go along with it, have them to his house without
other guests and offer them only liquor and snacks. Subject is
to determine KORMUSHKIN's motive in asking himself to Subject's
home. By the way whenever Subject has mentioned KORMUSHKIN in the
last few months he has invariably remarked that he is a very heavý
drinker.
5-
•
b. On 6 December LOGINOV came in from 1230 to 1242. Ho
had previously asked Subject about helping the Soviets to find a
house for their school. This time he asked about the new (LILYRIC)
building how much an apartment costs (1500 MN), who lives there
(chemical engineer in penthouse (LILYRIC), a German family on the
second floor, etc. LOGINOV's questions were general and so were
Subject's answers.
-
c. On Saturday 3 December 1966 SILNIKOV came in from 1412
to 1430. He asked for two receipts of ca 5 MN each for bread, saying
that he had lost the real ones. Subject thinks he uses these small
sums to buy beer and girlie magazines. SILNIKOV then leafed through
a girlie magazine and then said he wants Subject to find him a girl
for whose favors he is willing to pay 100 MN. (COMMENT: chiseling
10 MN in false receipts and in the next breath offering 100 MN
for a girl?)

The C/O arranged to deliver some liquor to Sub] at the time he was hosting.
an Air France cocktail at the Hotel Reforma. After the liquor was transferred
to Subj's car in a nearby parking lot, Subj recounted to the C/O the story of a
visit he had had from Valentin Loginov that day.
2. Subj reported that Loginov came to his office unannounced and prevalled on
Subj to step down to the street to have a coffee with him. Loginov presented.
Sub with four bottles of vodka for Christmas, and then started to ask Subj
some personal questions
1) How had Subj left Poland (after WILL) for Parts had his documentation
been legal or tilegal. Subj answered that it was legal.
2) How was he able to enter Paris- did he have a valid French visa. Subj
said he did. How long did he stay in Paris. Subj said a few months.

3) has he released from service with the (Polish) UB? Subj_gald yes. Nero..

contacted in Mexico. (In March 1955) by a Polish diplomatic courier who brought.
a letter from Subj's old boss in the UB, Stanchuk (phonetic), and how Sudj
answered that latter. /Comment: Believe the story given in some detail in
debriefing of Subj on his experiences in UB and WWII. Loginov wanted to know
if Subj's response to Poles had been, positive or negative. Subj´said it had
been neutral. Asked why, Subf replied that he believed that eighty percent
of the Foles were anti-Soulet. Loginov said "You are right.”

4) Loginov asked Subj how he was getting along with the American airlines.
he deals with. Subj said "fine", and asked why. Loginov said that maybe, Aƒ
Sub has the chance, he can learn the name of the director of the CIA in
Mexico".¨· Subj told Loginov he was crazy, or couldn't be serious; he couldn't
get that information. Loginov asked Subj if he could, would he tell the
Soviets. Subj said "maybe."
R
"
"
Subj said to Loginov that he would show Loginov the documents that back
up his answers to Loginov's questions, but that he was busy through Christmas
but could possibly see him after Christmas and before New Years.
The C/O asked Surf if he had inquired of Loginov why the latter was asking
such questions. Subf said he did not, even though he was completely puzzled
by this tack on the part of the Soulets. But Subj felt perfectly at ease in
telling the truth to the Soviets, and had no hesitation in showing them his
documentation.
The C/O told Subj that we would discuss this matter further.

and that his "maybe" was just a uny of Joshing Loginov. Subf then anserted to
to
the C/O that he felt strong in his capacity to deal with the Sortets, and that
his joking remarks in now way vitiated that strength..
he-
The C/O brought up the matter of Subj's having told Loginov he would supply.
his personal documents to Loginov, and (solely with the design of reaching for:
Subj's motive) stated that we thought it would be better if Subj did nothing
to pass these documents to the Soviet's and held them off indefinitely. Subj
appeared a bit chagrined at the C/O's request, and told the C/O why:
munted to give those bastards" his documents to show them he had nothing to
hide, and that he was not afraid of them; if he didn't give over his documents
they night think they had something on him. Further he felt that he was buying.
Insurance by handing them over openly, and gave as an example that he might be
flying in Europe and might find himself diverted or force-landed in a place
Like Prague or Warsaw - and it would be a comfort to him to know that he Afthing.
to be afraid of concerning any irregularities in his past.
t
-
Therefore, Subj asked the C/O to check with his "bosses" to see if he could
get the go-ahead on handing over his documents. Subf said if the answer to "no"
he will comply, but his pleading to the C/O appeared as if Subj thought his was
the wiser course. Comment: Despite the C/O's method of challenging Subj on
specifics, like the "maybe" and the passing of the documents, the C/O's own
opinion is that Subj has achieved a very satisfactory status in his dealings
with the Soviets, satisfactory in the sense that it is in accord with the
Station's objectives in the case and equally important that it can be maintained
because it is consistent with Subj's personality and outlook.f
.
and
7. Subj expressed a destre for another get-together with the C/O and his wife.
The C/O explained that his wife would be leaving Mexico by mid-January
Subj, who doesn't need any pictures to be drawn for him, immediately hazarded
the opinion that that meant that the C/O would be leaving not too long after.
The C/O acknowledged this possibility, but said he had no idea of when it would
take place. Subj wanted to know if there would be someone to take the C/O'a
place when the time came, and the C/O answered that of course there would.
The time for the get-together is left for some indefinite date before the
C/O's wife departe.

On 11 October 1965 at 2200 hours Pavol A. YATEKOV
was soon having dinner with an unidentified Mexican male at the
Tablita" Restaurant on the corner of Ejercito Kacional and
small
Gutenberg. At the end of their meal the Bexican pushed A
object scross the table towards YATSKOV. YATSKOY covered this
object with his napkin and then put the object in his pocket.
It was obvious that this object was passed in a clandestine
mankor. They then left the restaurant together and separated.
The Mexican then went to a jeep with DP license 11-63 (1964-1965
issue) and drove off alone. This jeep had a seal reading
"Procuraduria General de Justicia del Distrito y Territorios
Federalos - Policia Judicial." Thus, it can be assumed that
the person is an employee of the Judicial Polico.
The unidentified Mexican male
Mexican male was described as about
35 years old, about 170 cm tall, 70 kilos in weight, slight
build, dark complexion, dark eyes, black moustache, and he was
dressed in a conservative business suit.
It is noted that both Carlos CABAMADRID and Carlos
BLANCO are similar in appearance to the above described person.

LOGINOV took the place of HECHI PORENKO when KICHI PORENKO left

able to see Subject. ISAYEV then added Subject shouldn't forget
about what lOGINOV had asked him. Subject answered that he didn't
know what ISAYEV was talking about. ISAYEV simply answered,
"Good, he will come to see you). I asked Subject why ISAYEV
would be discussing LOGINOV's business with him. Subject had no
idea, except that he thinks, because of this, that they are
connected professionally. (COMMENT: GRU and KGB?)

2 or 3 years. (COMMENT: Colonia Pensil is in the
western part of Tacuba and is full of Lagos, but nothing
anywhere near Lago Coni). I told Subject to go ahead and get
me the information on Nicolas LNU anyway. His notes on this
are in the entry for 26 October.

we attacked his notes which contained the following items
worthy of note :

On 11 October LOGINOV came in and asked Subject
to keep looking for a house near the Embassy. He said they
want it for a school to which the children can walk since
driving them back and forth to the present school is proving
cumbersone He also suggested that Subject sign the rental
contract since many people are unwilling to rent to Soviets.
When I expressed surprise about Subject signing a contract for
5,000 pesos a month he said that he had done it before for a
Soviet Colonel in 1953 (the year Stalin died). This house was
at Chicontepec 70 and rented for 4,000 pesos. (COMMENT: That
Subject could sign a contract for 5,000 pesos a month is
Pidiculous That the Soviets are looking for a new school
Just after moving into the new one is strange).

2.
Subject started things out by saying that (LOGINOY is
tryin to recruit him to report on LIEMPTY-6. Review of his notes
and discussion revealed the following: On 5 November LOGINOV
came in. Subject told him he had found a house on Juanacatlan.
LOGINGV said that he's looking for one on the Chapultapec Park
side of Talz. Tacubaya and for Subject to keep looking. Then
LOGE V. said that he would like to rent an apartment at P.A.
de
Santos 104. Subject told him they are all occupied.
LOGINOV said Subject must know these apartments well. Subject
admitted that he did and began to sketch them by LOGINOV
didn't seem to be interested in his efforts. LOGINOV then asked,
how many apartments there were in the building. Subject answered,
16. LOGINOV then said that since Subject knows the apartments
so well he must also know the people who live there. Subject
admitted that he did. At this point some other Soviets came in
and the conversation was terminated. On 6 November LOGINOV
dropped by for some small talk and left some Soviet chocolate
(which Subject showed me) for Subject's grandchild. On 9 November
LOGINOV came in at 1230 and asked Subject to go to a restaurant
with him. Subject countered by saying his wife was home sick
and he had no one to leave the store with. Subject then invited
LOGINOV to his house but LOGINOV insisted on a restaurant.
Subject agreed to go on 12 or 13 November.
:
3. From the above Subject concludes that LOGINOV wants to
recruit him to report on LIEMPTY-6 (who lives in P.A. de los
Santos 104). I asked why LOGINOV would be interested in LIEMPTY-6
(there is nothing about him in the notes). Subject answered.
that he finds LIELPTY-6 very suspicious because in the 5 years
that he has known him, Subject doesn't know what he does for a
living. He thinks he writes novels. In any case he is home
all day long. In addition, he lies. Example: He told Subject
that he owns the new (LILYRIC) building. He is also eccentric.
Besides his windows face on the Embassy. LIEMPTY-6 has apartment.
17. The apartment directly below his, number 13, (probably old
LILYRIC) is empty. Subject went to see the owner having LOGINOV
in mind. The owner said that the apartment had been rented by
LÍF MPTY-6 which Subject also finds surprising. The whole theme
was that he is suspicious of LIEMPTY-6 and that LOGINOV wants
to recruit him to report on him. All of the above on LIEMPTY-6
and his apartment was verbal. There was not a word about him
in his notes.
4. I told Subject that if LOGINOV tries to recruit him for
any purpose, he is to cut him short and to indignantly refuse.
He is also to tell LOGINOY that SILNIKOV had tried the same thing
two months ago.

he hoped I didn't, if there was anything I wanted to

time and proceeded to backtrack over some of the ground
just covered. As for his schedule and itinerary, he
plans to leave for Moscow on 23 October via Air France,

Paris to Genoa for a day on travel business and then
return to Mexico from Paris on Air France via New York,
where he plans to pick up a couple of suits and take in
"Superman" on Broadway. He will arrive back in Mexico
on 3 october November.
3. Subject said that in addition to the other
three agents whom he had mentioned last time as having
been invited to the Intourist Conference--Moises SCHUSTER
of Mundos Tours, Carlos IBARGUEN of De Carlo Tours, and
*
Edmundo GARZA of Garza Travel Service--he had learned that
Isaac BULAEVSKY of Jet Travel Agency had also received
an invitation. Besides himself, however, only SCHUSTER
and BULAEVSKY are going, the other two having decided
against the trip for unknown reasons. Subject mentioned.
that SCHUSTER is going to take his son, who is in his
early teens.
4. I asked Subject if he had been in touch with
anyone at the Soviet Embassy about the trip or if anyone
there seemed to be responsible for lining up participants

1. Subf repeated that Valentir Leinov and dropped by the office during the wook
and went to have coffer with Subj (subj remarked that Loginov doesn't seen to want
to talk in the office)." Lorine had brought along visa application forms for Subj,
and Subj filled them out for himself and his son, Marcos, and turned them over to
Loginov along with the passports (attached are copies of the visas- note: the visaa
are good for over 20 days in the Soviet Union, although the INTURIST conference is
from 24 Oct to 29 Oct).
Loginov told Subj that Pavel Yatakov, wanted to see him (presumably Yatnkov
has brought something back for Subj). Subj asked Loginov what Yatskov is doing.
The Soviet replied that Yatskov has a job in the Embassy. Subj pressed: "What kindw
of a job. It's worthwhile that you gave him a good job." Loginov replied: "You"
want to now too much."
2. The C/O asked Subj what decided him to go to the Soviet Union. Subj replied
that he had a commission from the Petroleum Congress (Subj is involved in orgnizing
the Congress for Mexico for 2 to 8 April 1967), actually in behalf of KW! and his
own interests, to persuade the Sovieta that they use some other airline thin
Aeroflot to transport the Soviet delegates to Mexico. /Comments the C/O a

He said the latter remains his position in Mexico, or anywhere else but in the Soviet
Union.

late that afternoon. He told Subject that the "people"
at the Embassy whom he had introduced Subject to earlier
were interested in talking with him and asked if he could

drop into the Embassy in the next few days. Sub
immediately recognized which "people" Lautz was referring
to, said that as a matter of fact he had something to
discuss with "them," commented that it probably in fact
involved the same matter, and agreed to come to Lautz's
office at 11:00 the next day. As he had done with Irving

1. Subj had been to Los Angeles, California for a few days and had returned to
Mexico on 5 Oct. Evidently he had accompanied a Puebla delegation that visited
Douglas and Lockheed aircraft factories in California. He mentioned that
Aeronaves had purchased two DC#8's from Douglas, and ordered some DC-9's. At
the Lockheed plant they saw the new super-sonte airplane.
2. Subj had received on 6 Oct a confirmatory telegram from INTURIST, for Subj
and his son (copy attached), re attendance at the INTURIST conference in l'oscow.
Also, in the mail of 7 Oct Subj had received INTURIST releases on travel regulations
for tourists to the Soviet Union, pronational plans, tours, etc. (Subf will make
copies of these for turnover to the c/o).

Subj reported that Valentin Loginoy come by the office on 29 Sept. Subj was
with a friend, Peter Parr, of New York, so he went to have coffee with Lorinev
taking along his friend. The discussion was innocuous, but Loginov, asked Subj
if he would be coing to see his friends, which Subj took to mean that all was 0.Kk.
as far as Subj's attendance in Moscow for the I'TUPEST conference. Subj answered
"yes". Loginov jckingly asked Subj whey Rusk had come to Mexico. Subjantered
a reply that the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs was going to serve some rare
Champagne that husk liked. Loginov pressed Subj for the real renson. Suby and

for doing so little to alleviate the lot of the Jewn in
the Soviet Union. He anclared that the Soviet Union was the worst offender aminst
the Jene, because they were eliminating the race, not through physical extermination,
but through forcing asimilation. His own view was that the Soviets were more
dangerous to the down and Israel than were the Arabs, for instance Lebenon or Jordan,
who if it weren't for four of Nasser would make their peace with Farnel.
The C/O tried to counter the self-recrimination of Subj by telling him that
he had accomplished a superb job in the duel of the West with the Soviets through
his cooperation with us. That, in view of his real feelings about the Soviets, his
dealing with them had been masterful. Subj shook off the C/O's optimistic view of
Subj's contribution to the "cause."
4. The C/O brought up the request to get full details on the travel of all non-
Soviets to the Soviet Union - and augested that Subj automatically have duplicates
made of the visa requests for such people. Subj said that would be simple and

Subject replied that he had been at the Soviet Embassy
about the middle of September on visa business and had
seen the Soviet he always deals with on visa matters,
but that this individual seemed surprised to hear Subject
had been invited to Moscow and claimed to know nothing--
or at least none of the details--about the Intoruist
Conference.
Subject claimed not to be able to remember
the Soviet's name, hunted around in his wallet unsuc-
cessfully for the Soviet's card, and then said, well,
in any case it was the individual he had mentioned
last time as having just gotten a promotion to Consul.
I finally asked him if he meant LOGINOV- whose name he
had given me last time--and after thinking for a moment,

he rolled that yes, that sounded right. I then asked
him if LOGINOV had shown any more interest in him or
in any way been more friendly toward him in the last
couple of months or since he had received the Intourist
invite. Subject replied that he had not.
5. Subject seemed a little sensitive to this
question, and I stated that I was sure he understood
why I was asking, since I knew he had been thoroughly
briefed by one of my predecessors prior to his 1963
trip to the Soviet Union on Soviet interest in visitors
to the USSR. I explained that we had no intention to
ask him to do what he had agreed to do on his last.
trip to the USSR (accept recruitment if offered), and
that we did not want to burden him with any instructions
on how to behave or respond while there. However, I
said, we continued to feel he was of potential interest
to the Soviets and wanted to make sure he was aware of
this when he went over, had a healthy respect for the
leverage the Soviets have on their home ground, and

the USSR and had given Lautz a list of three other
invitees to the Intourist conference. Lautz introduced
me by true name as Oronsky's replacement. Subject, in
what Lautz had forewarned me was his usual over-enthusiastic
manner, greeted me with a "believe me, it is my pleasure"
salutation and, upon confirming that it was the Intourist
conference I was interest in, took off from there. Without
the slightest prompting, he rattled off the following:
a) He had received a telegram from Moscow on
6 September inviting him to an Intourist conference in
Moscow from-24-29 October. He had immediately thought
of informing the Embassy, but because of the pressure
of business simply hadn't gotten around to it. When
Lautz called him, he knew immediately what we were
Interested in.
1 b). He had prepared a Xerox copy of the telegram
for us, which he gave to me. He has not yet definitely
made up his mind about attending the conference, but
thinks he probably will go. At the moment, he was still
awaiting the detailed letter on the conference which,
according to the telegram, was to follow. (LICOZY-5 has
already received his letter.) In reply to my question
as to whether he was sending enough people to the USSR
to make the trip really worthwhile, he said that he
had sent only five people there so far this year, but
that he thought travel to the Soviet Union was definitely

to Moscow could consequently be made at relatively little
additional expense.
c) Subject continued that if he did go to Moscow,
he would be glad to submit a report on his trip when he
got back, get (group) pictures, if we wanted them, of
intivasymmetra opanibe the leukandaj,
his eyes open. However, he said, as he told Oronsky, he
is not interested in working for us on a permanent basis,
meeting clandestinely with us, or taking any money,
was willing to help, he explained, because he believed
basically what we did about current world problems and,
after all, had lived in the States for many years and
regarded it as his "second home." He said he liked the
arrangement of meeting in Lautz's office because it made
clandestine meetings unnecessary and because he had a
perfectly legitimate reason for being there..
d) Subject stated that he had already given Lautz
the names of the other travel agents in Mexico whom he
had heard had been invited to Moscow and said that once
he received the Intourist letter giving the details on
the conference he would begin calling around to see
exactly who was going.
3. Since a) Subject had already volunteered to do .
primarily what I intended to ask him, b) had not yet
definitely decided to make the trip, c) Lautz gave no
indication of preparing to leave us alone, and d) I
clearly could not get any farther with Subject on a
personal level with Lautz present, I brought the meeting
to an end with a request to see Subject again after he
had received the Intourist letter, obtained the names of
those of his colleagues who were going, and decided"
definitely whether or not he was going to go. Subject
said he would be happy to talk with me again, get the

Subject also gave me an Air France tourist pamphlet on
the USSR in Spanish for my information.
6. Subject mentioned in passing that he would be
glad to furnish us (presumably on a regular basis) with
the names of those people who book travel to the Soviet
Union through his Agency, but said Oronsky had previously
shown disinterest in such information. In view of Oronsky's
alleged disinterest, I let the subject pass without comment,

"be briefed"
on the trip. It was agreed he would call Lautz to set
up the meeting. (The situation was such that I do not
blame Lautz for apparently thinking it unnecessary to
leave us alone this time, but I made a special point
of requesting that he leave us to ourselves next time..
Lautz, who seems to be thoroughly friendly and accommodating,
readily agreed.)
1~
4. Subject impresses me as a very sharp, shrewd,
cool-headed, but probably basically sincere individual.
He had the situation figured perfectly when he arrived
in Lautz's office, had decided precisely what he would
be willing to do, knew exactly what he was going to say,
and wasted no words in saying it. I plan to try to get .
to know him a little better next time, give him a defensive
briefing as well as one on what to keep his eyes open
for, and also explore his attitude toward a possible
recruitment pitch from the Soviets. (Prior to his trip
to the USSR in May 1963, Subject agreed to accept Soviet
recruitment if approached and to serve as a DA Upon
his return, however, he reported that the Soviets made.
no approach to him.) I also want to ask him about LOGINOV,
og on whom he agreed to supply personality data
to Oronsky, put evidently never did. Subject mentioned
that LOGINOV had told him about ten days ago that he
had been promoted to Consul. Subject did not say if
he had been in touch with LOGINOV or anyone else at the
Soviet Embassy about the Intourist conference. I will
get this from him next time.

5. Subject told Lautz that the following individuals
had been invited to the Intourist conference:
(a) Moises Schuster of Mundos Tours.
(b) Carlos IBARGUEN of De Carlo Tours
(IBARGUEN
is also the president of the Mexican Travel Agents' Assoc.).

PERSONALITY ASSESSMENT QUESTIONNAIRE
:
1. This is a new, experimental version of the Personality Assessment
Questionnaire (sometimes informally called the PRQ III) which has been in
use for several years. This new form is largely a checklist and thus requires
far less essay-type reporting than the previous form.
2. For a number of years, our operational psychologists have been de-
veloping a system for indirect assessment of target personalities. The
system employs-in lieu of psychological tests and interviews-observations
of appearance, manner, and style of behavior. Such observations are
used as if they were items in a psychological test, and like test items, are
weighted and analyzed to yield a personality profile. Working from the
profile, operational psychologists describe the target personality's basic
aptitudes, attitudes, motives and susceptibilities. The goal of the assess-
ment is to identify feasible means of influencing the target person.

3. Reliability is vastly increased when two or more observers complete
this questionnaire independently. All items need not be completed; in fact,
is a rare case where
encouraged to guess wontact is sufficient to complete it fully. Your
at
where complete information is lacking. Mark such
items with a "G," instead of the customary check mark or "X." Thus, an
observer with very limited contact can be expected to enter more
than "X's.

Overall impression of eating and smoking behavior. (Check the
most appropriate description:)
A hearty eater with well-defined preferences. He eats and smokes
with considerable gusto but tends to be a little on the coarse and
boorish side. It is rather easy to imagine him eating huge sand-
wiches and drinking beer with the boys at the neighborhood bar
A heavy eater with limited preferences. He eats and smokes
with gusto but his manners are definitely coarse and boorish
It
is rather easy to imagine him becoming quite sharp with
waiter who serves him unfamiliar fond or a dish prepared in
an unfamiliar way.
A sensual eater who knows all the restaurants and their native
specialties. He is very anxious to have others try dishes he
has discovered. He eats with obvious pleasure, savors his
smokes, and though rarely gauche, he is more aware of his
food than his manners.. It is easy to imagine him cooking and
serving special dishes to his friends.

A conventional eater who usually goes along with the crowd.
He probably has food allergies that prevent him from eating
certain foods. He gives the impression of enjoying smoking

bite at a sidewalk stand at any time of day.
A gourmet eater who has marked and varied sophisticated

(Check the most appropriate description.)
11.03.01
11.03.02
He is a hearty, hale fellow who laughs with gusto and pleasure.
His humor is forthright, not subtle, and although he is somētimes
loud, he is rarely unpleasant or objectionable. Most of the
time, his good humor is contagious.
He is a hearty fellow who, when he laughs, does so with con-
siderable gusto. However, he is fréquently dour and sometimes
intolerant and somewhat humorless. His humor is direct, even
crude, and at times, inappropriate. He tends to be the kind of
„person who laughs more at people than with people.

Overall impression: Which of the following best describes him?
He is an earthy, lusty man who shows little embarrassment about
sex. He treats women appropriately, but makes little effort to
conceal his admiration and attraction. He appears virile and
self-confident with women, and most women seem to like it.
He is an earthy, lusty man who on occasion can be crude or
even vulgar. He treats women rather harshly, and can become
quite pushy when attracted to a woman. He seems to be very
proud of his virility. Many women would be offended or re-.
buffed by his aggressiveness, but this does not seem to bother
him.

He is a good-humored fellow who sometimes can be considered
jolly and carefree. His humor is clever and well timed. He is
quite sensitive to the moods and feelings of others and often
can do a good job appropriately livening up a party. Although
something of a tease, he is never cruel or insensitive.
'He is generally a rather quiet and somewhat complacent person
who, at times, can be surprisingly gay and carefree. However,
when gay, he sometimes overdoes it and causes some strain for
those around him. His humor is often cleyer but he can be
quite sarcastic and even biting on occasion.
He is an urbane fellow, generally quite conventional and appro-
priate. He does not necessarily appear to be a humorless person,
but he seldom displays his sense of humor. It is sometimes diffi-
cult to tell whether he is in a good humor, because of the way
he covers or controls his feelings. His humor is more studied.
than spontaneous yet it is never crude or inappropriate.
He is a dour and humorless person, always serious and intense
It is difficult to joke around him partly because he is not re-
sponsive and partly because he seems to disapprove...
He is a sensitive, sophisticated fellow with a subtle wit. He
can be quite charming and amusing in the right sort of setting.
However, there is something of an aristocratic quality to his
sense of humor and he can be quite condescending towards
people who do not understand or appreciate his sense of humor

flippant at times. His humor tends to be a bit far out. He

He is a somewhat sensual, rather soft man who is very consid-
crate of women. He is prone to hold a woman's hand overly
long when talking to her and frequently puts his arms around
women he admires. He often uses flattery and compliments
but does so rather graciously. Most women usually like his
attentiveness.
He is a sensual person, but is embarrassed and insecure about
it. He is a rather soft man who tries hard to be inoffensive..
However, he will frequently follow attractive women with his
eyes when he thinks no one is looking. He is also prone to
brush against or touch women accidentally" whenever he gets
a chance.
He is a self-confident, rather polished person who is proper
and conventional with either men or women. He is always
considerate and polite with all women and it is difficult to
ascertain what his sexual attitudes and interests might be.
In a group, he always behaves according to protocol and
usually can be quite efficient in doing so.
"
He is a self-confident and precise person who has something
of the air of a professional man about him. · He is polite,
almost to a fault, and is inclined to go out of his way to
light a woman's cigarette or see that she is properly taken
care of. Nevertheless, he shows considerable distance in
his relations with women. Sometimes his formality is out
of place, but he will rarely, if ever, change his manners
or procedures to fit the situation.
3
He is a charming, urbane person and both friendly and
sophisticated. He deals with women in a cultured way
but shows little sensuality or sexual inappropriateness.
He is neat, even dapper, and can be quite fastidious.
Most of his relations with women appear to be quite pla-
tonic. He is the kind of person who likely has several
Every close friends who are women.
He is a somewhat shy and indifferent person whom some
people consider odd or unusual. He shows little or no
interest in women in public. In general, he is a preọc-
cupied person who only seeks out people with similar
interests. There is an ascetic, asexual air about him
most of the time.
None of these fit. I would describe him as:

8 Dec 1300- 1345, Subj's office
December 1966
2.
The C/O arrived at Subf's office while Sub] was on his way down to the
street to meet Valentin Loginor who had called by phone to ask sub to step
down to the street. It turned out that all Loginov was interested in uns to
gire Subf two tickets for the Ballet for 9 December. Loginos kingly asked
Subt if he had gone to the meeting of the two presidents at the border- and
Sub rejoined that he didn't make that meeting but would be on hand for the
turning over of the Chamizal. /Comment: the C/O was not aware of any Soviet
lottering about as he entered Subj's building/.
=
2. Sudj reported that Alexandr Prikhodko had dropped in to the office
unexpectedly on 3 Dec, but was prevented from talking to Suby deccuse Subj's
wife and son were there. Prikhodko asked when he could have lunch with Subj,
and Sub] told him to call next week, but that he was terribly busy during the
Christmas rúgh.
The C/O took the opportunity to impress on Subj again that he was to do
nothing, absolutely nothing, for the Soviets. Even if the Spotete only wanted
to know about charged visa requirements for travel in Latin America - Subj was

3. The C/O brought up the subject of Jacobo Zabludovsky's mention to Subj of
Echeverrid's interest in enlisting the support of influential Jews in his bid
for the Presidency, and asked if subj had heard anything further on this.
Sub said "no.""
But he related the story ccain for the
Back in October 1965 Schererria was attending a conference at which Subj
was present. Echevarria came down off the presidium directly to Subj's table

Subj related this to Zabludorsky, and it was then that tablutovský told
that Echevarria had spoken to him and said he feels he is a strong candidate:
the Presidency, and would like to have a committee of five people in the
Jewish community to coordinate with him. Zabludovsky told Subt he was intending
to propose Subj. Zabludovky did not make any others.
c
The C/O asked Subf who he thought some of the other likely Javish leaders
Light be. Sub seld it was hard to say, but he named two: Nickey Feldman, a
Parker and Fernando Jana, the head of B'nai B'rith.
The C/O asked Subj to check with Zabludovsky on the whole matter again, when
he had the opportunity. Subj said he would do so.
Subf is intending to take a two day trip to Colombia, either 9 or 10 Dec,
connection with the Fetroleum Congress.

The C/O dropped by Subj's office on 22 Dec, after having delivered a
Christmas gift of liquor to. Subj's home the previous day.
Subf was very appreciative of the gift.

2. Subj showed the C/O the reservation card for travel of Soviet Georgi Viako
and his family, Nina, Irina and Marina. They're booked for departure from Nexico
for 25 Dec by Air France, for Paris. "Juris to Brussels, where Visko has four days

Visko had visited Subj in company with another Soviet who Subd was told was
Vtako's successor: (from the latter's card) - Victor M. Ivanov, Consejero Comercial
de la Embajada Sovietica.

3. Subj stated that he had received a letter from Sidney Weintraub, U.S. State
Department official now in Chile, Inviting Subj to visit him. /Comment: Weintraub
formerly stationed in Mexico and later in Washington was the subject of interest
by the Soulets in Mexico, who had subj try to maintain contact on his Washington
trips/. Please forward this information to Gerald F. Gestetner in Santiago.
"
Subj sold he had received a firm invitation from Mr. Hawning (phonetic), Mgr.
of Air France in Mexico, to go on the inaugural flight of Air France to Red China,
posɔlbly in April 1967. Subj was completely neutral about his going, but asked
the c/o if we had any interest in his taking the trip to Red China. The C/O sald
we would let him know about that..
.
5. The C/O asked Subj to have the door to his office closed, so that we might
discuss a serious matter. The C/O said he wanted to explore frankly the status
of Subj's relationship toward the Soulets. The C/O stated, bluntly that there
was a feeling "higher up" that Sub] had not achieved a sufficient degree of
cut-off from the Soviets, and that his posture of friendly compromise weakened
his stance. In reply, Subf mentioned the two elements that went into his
attitude toward the Soviets:
71
a) rẻ the financial gain from associating with them, Subj sald that had fallen
to such an insignificant level that it had no effect in his dealings with the
Soulets. And he said that level would sink even more when the Soviets inaugurate
Aeroflot flights from Montreal and New York (the Soviets do not handle bookings
on Aeroflot through agents).
}
b) his personality (the C/O had asked if it were possible for Subj to become cool
or even unfriendly toward the Soviets); Subj said he could not change his
personality. In the past year he had cooled off noticeably, having resisted all
cooperation with them, avoided them, put difficulties in the way of meetings, etc.
But it was against his grain to be unfriendly toward people with whom he might
be thrown into association. He cited proudly that he was not beholden to the
Soviets for anything, and never went out of his way to seek anything from them;
for instance, he had been told that Panel Yatskop had brought back caviar for
Subj on his return from the Soviet Union but Sudj made no move to call Yatskov
(when, and if Yatskov calls him, he will see him and cannot understand how he
could be unfriendly to Yatekov under such circumstances).
-
The C/O mentioned to Subj the latter's equivocal reply of "maybe" when
Loginov had asked if Sub) would report the name of the CIA chief in Mexico if
he knew/it. Subj replied that he had told Loginov that the latter was crazy

5. The Station had not believed that Subject would be able
to take the 21 March flight to Havana, since there had been no
record of his having requested a Cuban visa; however, a LIONION
photograph subsequently received showed that Soviet Vice Consul
Vladislav Sergeyevich KORMUSIIKIN (201-744341) had visited the Cuban
Embassy in person on 16 March 1966, at which time he probably
arranged for Subject's visa.

3. During January 1966 Cristobal
employed by the American Embassy in Mexico City, made several trips
to the Soviet Embassy in regard to a Soviet visa for one of the
American Embassy officials. TORRES spoke with Subject, who, after
asking whether it would get TORRES in trouble if he went to dinner
with Subject, ended up by inviting TORRES to dinner on 24 January
1966. TORRES did not meet Subject that date, and on 8 February 1966
Subject called TORRES at the American Embassy to ask why he had not
shown up.
TORRES, replied that he had had to work. Subject asked.
whether TORRES had located a person who could teach him English.
TORRES replied that one person whom he had asked had not been
interested, and Subject asked him to keep looking for someone.
Subject again called TORRES on 9 February 1966, but TORRES was out.
(It is noted that Subject's calls to TORRES have not appeared on
LIENVOY and were therefore presumably made from a pay station.)

Valem in Sergeyevich LOGINOV (201-285412), stopped by his office on
legitimate business, then sald he had some (operational) business for
him. LICOZY-5 demurred, but LOGINOV went ahead, took a plece
of paper out and began reading from it, asking LICOZY-5 If he knew.
"Eduardo WEBELMAN," LICOZY-5 Interrupted, saying he did not know the
man and did not want to do anything about him, LOGINOV sald he did not
want LICOZY-5 to do anything, it was just that he did not know who he was.
LICOZY-5 refused to discuss it further. When LOGINOV left LICOZY-5's
office be left behind a plece of paper with the following written on it in
Russian:

owner of a steel plant and a firm which sells photographic equipment. Came
to Mexico during World War II, Lives in the Pedregal at Teololco 320.

to Mexico on 8 December 1939 as a student. In 1942 he had received
"Immigrante" status and was working for Adolfo *WEBELMAN Cookpe (?),
manager of WEBELMAN y Cla. a firm then located at Aluminio 192 In

KGB and GRU. Residencies in Mexico City
.
1. Attached are analyses of the KGB and GRU residencies in.
Mexico City. Included are only those officers who are probably
or known to be intelligence officers. Of the 52 Soviets currently
assigned to Mexico City, 22 are identified intelligence officers
and 13 probably intelligence officers, i.e. roughly 67% of the total
Soviet colony.
2. The case officers have not been divided into separate
target groups, with the exception of KGB S & T ce the Station's
information is too fragmentary for a realistic breakdown. with the
exception of S. S. KONSTANTINOV, who is known to be the KGB resident,
the positions of resident and deputy resident are unconfirmed, but
represent the Station's best guess.

LOGINOV and a cond Sovlet at an unknown restaurant at 1800 hours
on or about 18 May. He claimed to have talked to these two
Soviets for approximately one hour (1.e, until about 1900 hours)
after which they left the restaurant, walked to and entered LOGINOY's
car, drove to an unknown apartment near the Sovlet Embassy,
parked the car and entered the apartment and then phoned three
call-girls who arrived within 20 minutes. Following the arrival
of the girls Subject excused himself and left the apartment about
1900 or 1930 hours. To our knowledge there is no precedent for
the KGB using call-girls for the purpose and to the manner
described by Subject

4. Subject stated that he believed that the automobile
driven by LOGINOV, an automobile that he had seen several times,
bore the license number "67 Our records show that no Soviet
Embassy official or employée drives an automobile with the number
67 or 76. LOGINOV drives an automobile with Mexico City
diplomatic license 19 DA.
5. Subject's statements to the effect that LOGINOV despos ited
50,000.00 Mexican pesos to Subject's account in the Banco de
Londres in Veracruz as a "gift" for nothing" and then took
the money back when Subject refused it, is not in keeping with
our experience with regard to KGB modus operandi. Also,

Subject's general vagueness as to daten, ilmes,
addresses and locations in connection with his encounters with
LOGINOV, in addition to those points cited above, leads us to
the conclusion that Subject has fabricated a large portion of what he
has stated. This office has little doubt that he did meet LOGINOV

subsequent to this occasion as fabrication,

Soviet Embassy in BUENOS AIRES in 1960, and was listed as
Attaché in HAVANA in 1961-63, where his exact duties
were not known." If he now assumes ECHIPORENKO's post

Travel of Soviets to Mazatlan

This office has received a report that two
members of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City,
Valentin Sergeyevich LOGINOV and Yevgeniy Nikolayevich
GORLITSYN, planned to travel by air to Mazatlan on
2 November 1965. The length of their stay and the
purpose of their travel was not reported, but it may
well be connected with the docking of a Soviet ship.
2. This office would appreciate receiving any
information available to you on the trip of these
Soviets.

1. LICOZY/5_reported that on 12 October 1965 Subject visited
his place of business and said that he had been referred to LICOZY/S
ho
by the Soviot Embassy. Ho said he was interested in a one-way ticket
to the Soviet Union. Subject furnished the following information
to LICOZY/S : Ho was born on 19 August 1942 in Michigan. He is
a student at U.C.L.A. and wanted to visit the USSR as a tourist.
Subject held U. S. passport number C 530394 issued 29 August 1962.
His permanent address was given as 19222 Pacific Coast Highway,
Malibu, California. His tourist card showed that he entered Nexico
by bus at Sonoita, Sonora on 9 October 1965. Subject paid for 15
days in the Soviet Union but said that he planned to stay longer.
2. He left Mexico via Air France flight 702 on 16 October
(confirmed by flight manifests). His plans call for him to depart
Paris for Moscow via Air France flight 724 on 17 October
3. During a routine visit to the Consular Section of the Soviet
Embassy, Valentin S. LOGINOV thanked LICOZY/5 for "taking caro"
of Subject but, in the presence of both PRIKHODKO and Consular
officor Vladimir S. KORMUSHKIN, LOGINOV admonished LICOZY/S for asking
=⠀ for more biographic data-than he needed to fill out the necessary
papers.—LICOZY/5 denied that he had asked for more information than
he needed. (Subject apparently reported LICOZY/5's actions in
obtaining the above biographic data (or was debriefed by LOGINOV,
a suspect KGB officer).
It seems unusual for an American student to travel from the
U. S. to Mexico in order to travel to the Soviet Union since ho is
automatically increasing the cost of his travel by a considerable
amount. Since Subject crossed into Mexico on 9 October, only a
week before his departure for the USSR, it would appear that he
came to México exclusively for this purpose. It thus appears that
the purpose of travelling via Mexico was to conceal this trip from
the U. S. authorities.

the store at various times of the evening on different days
of the week. His wife is not always in the store and he
would have to close the store in order to meet me. He
closes at 1400 hours on Sundays. I also instructed him to
change the speed of the recorder from 1-7/8ths to 3 3/4ths.
We have no recorders in the Station that will take a large
reel at 17/8ths and this extremely slow speed is not
necessary.
2. During early September Subject commented that there.
is a new apartment building being constructed on the corner
of Gelati and General de los Santos, across the street from
the Soviet Embassy. (This is our new basehouse). I took
considerable notes on this as though I had never heard of the

I asked him if a small fiesta might not help this situation
and he said that he thought that it might help. I told
him to make plans for a fiesta in honor of Mexican
Independence Day and to invite as many of the new Soviets
as possible. He said that he would probably give the
party on Friday, 17 September. I suggested that he invite
Yuriy ANDRIANOV (the GRU chauffeur) first and tell ANDRIANOV'
to invite sevēral of his friends. At the next meeting with
Subjeat he reported that NIKIFOROV, LOGINOV and KORMUSHKIN
were the only Soviets who came to the fiesta on the 17th.
They arrived, had a few drinks, danced to some Russian
records which they had brought with them and then left.
(All are KGB types). They told Subject that the other
1.
Soviets could not attend because they had to attend a Czech
Embassy reception that same evening. I can find no record
of such a reception either at the Czech on Polish Embassies
and there is no indication on the Soviet lines that they
1
had anything planned for that evening. A Soviet from
Cuba arrived on the 17th but we have no idea how many Soviets
were at the airport to greet him. I questioned Subject
about the Soviets who had appeared at the fiesta and he
gave me a little information about them. They visited his
atore several times in the next few weeks and I showed him
Le
photographs of the men and expanded on his previous information.
He had the following to say about them (he has previously
reported on NIKIFOROV).
LOGINOV: Subject said that he believes LOGINOV replaced

place before and asked several questions about it. He said
that the owner of the building is Sr. VILLAGRAN and that
VILLAGRAN has the reputation of being an anti-Communist
and a loyal Nexican citizen. He said that the building
would probably be completed by March 1966 and that it will
have about six floors. Several Soviets have mentioned to.
Subject that they would like to rent apartments in the
building since it is so close to the Embassy.

1..
3. Subject said that ISAYEV had been in his store about
the last week in September. (As far as I can tell this is
ISAYEV's first visit to Subject's-store.) ISAYEV made a
great many anti-U.S. remarks during his visit to the store
and blamed the U.S. for most of the world's troubles. At one
point he said that the Soviets made much better cars than
the U.S. and that Soviet cars were built like "tanks".
Subject laughed at this remark because the thought crossed
his mind that only a soldier would like to drive a "tank".
and from where Subject was standing at the time he could -
see the Soviet's new fleet of American Fords and Chevys.
__
4. I again asked Subject why the Soviets had not been
visiting his store in the evenings as they had in the past
and he insisted that it was because most of his "friends"
at the Embassy had returned to the Soviet Union beginning in
July and their replacements had not warmed up to him yet.

described him as being vulgar, crude, 111-mannered, short
tempered and a tyrant. He is a person who thinks that he

cigarettes. At the fiesta LOGINOV told him that he was
from the northern part of the Soviet Union, is married and
has children. He claimed to have served in the Red Army.
:
KORMUSHKIN:
Subject likes KORMUSHKIN who is friendly,
we'll mannered and outgoing. He speaks good Spanish and
told Subject that his wife likes Nexico. Although KORMUSHKÌN
was wearing glasses in the photo shown to Subject, he
commented that he often sees KORMUSHKIN without his glasses.
He smokes "Record" cigarettes and Subject calls him.
"El Jovencito".
5. Subject said that ISAYEV had dropped by his store
during the week of 18 October and spent some time making
fun of the King and Queen who were visiting Mexico at the
time. ISAYEV felt that the very existance of a King and
Queen in 1965 was silly. He also claimed that the Soviets
had discovered the Comet that was then in the sky. (The Comet
had actually been discovered by two Japanese and bears
their names.) He bragged about the great advances in the
Soviet Union in all fields and told Subject with great pride
that the ruble was worth more than the dollar.
He commented.

I changed the topic of conversation by saying that if he
reported that SILNIKOV wanted a girl for this Sunday,
would return the machine to him on Saturday, 6 November.
If not, he would get it back at the next regular meeting
which I would set on Friday when I meet him.

2. Subject reported that he had come back to Mexico from a trip on 10 August.
Nochiporenko was at the airport to greet him. Nochiporonko had visited his
office previously, and brought along his replacement "Valentin", and at that
timo had found out when Subject was expected back. Nochiporenko was invited
by Subject to visit him at his home for breakfast on 11 August. Ho showed up
alone. The only business discussed was that Nochi poronko said that Subject
P -2370°
would be contacted by "Sasha" (Alexander Prikhodka). Subject was not to contact
the Soviet Embassy, or in any other way try to reach Sasha. Subject had´a
souvenir pistol which he had obtained from some Cauloiter (presumably during
WII), and Nechiporenko asked if he might have it. Subject gave it to him.
Nechiporenko evidently asked Subject to arrange for a one day trip to Paris
for him while he was en route to the Secret Union from his stopover, Brussels.
(Subject complied, and notified his agent abroad. Subject received a wire a
few days ago that Nechiporenko was "no show" in Patis). Nechiporenko was not
interested in Subjoot's observations of U.S. attitudes toward the Viet Nam and
Dominican situations, although Subject had been asked to note such attitudes
while he was on his trip. Nechiporenko mentioned, without Subject knowing
that Catalina Torres, who had worked previously in Subject's office, who had
attended the Noxican Soviet Cultural Institute, who had as boy friend the merican
who was giving English lessons to Nechiporenko (Gary Hodges ?), and who had
married some Mexican and was now in Acapulco with her husband (works at Las Brisas)-
would be able to contact Nechiporenko by mail to the Soviet Embassy in Mexico.

that the U.S. was a waring nation while the Soviet Union
sought only peace and that the United States would change
to something similar to the Soviet system in the near future.
6. The rest of the meeting and the next two, were spent
discussing Stanislav SILNIKOV and his request that Subject
act as "fiador" on an apartment for him as well as supply'
him with a prostitute. (800 IIMMA-27568 of 4 Nov.) .
7. In addition, Subject said that ANDRIANOV had asked him
to get Viktor KALININ some aphrodisiac pills. ANDRIANOV
said that they were "for Viktor KALININ in Moscow" but
Subject thinks they are "for Yuriy ANDRIANOV in Mexico",
Subject said he hasn't the slightest idea where to buy
such a thing.
8. I told Subject to test the recorder by speaking into
the microphones both in the upstairs room as well as in the
main part of the store and then to play back the tape.
Although RESCIGNO has explained the workings of the recorder
to Subject several times, he claimed that he did not know
how to do this. I then instructed him to disconnect the
recorder and to deliver it to me at 2100 hours on Friday,
5 November. I said that I would test the recorder myself.
He asked why RESCIGNO could not come to the store and test
it and I told him that RESCIBNO was away. He then asked if
RESCIGNO was a Mexican or an American. He said that RESCIGNO
speaks Spanish like a Mexican and looks like a'Mexican but
that he (Subject) is sure that he an American. I told him

connection with Inturist. During the past few months he has
been giving Don Lautz reports on various Soviet tourists
such as the Soviet Orchestra which visited Mexico and Cuba
recently. Lautz passed these reports on to me and Cynthia
sent them home. Subject sees Lautz once or twice a week
in connection with visa matters. He told Lautz that he had
been contacted by KUBARK some years ago but that due to

He also wanted the costs of travel and baggage. Subject has
not given this report to YATSKOV. (A copy is attached.)

He said that he hoped that he and Subject would be as friendly

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD:
FOR THE RECORD:
FROM: Oronsky
SUBJECT:
LICOWL-1
14 February 1966
1. I met Subject on Friday, 11 February at 1900 hours. The
meeting was a very short one since I only wanted to determine
If he had found a girl for SILNIKOV to "paint". He said ue
was still looking.
-
The boy who watches Subject's store at night did not
show up on 7 February and Subject was forced to sleep above
the store himself. At 0300 hours on Tuesday (8 February) he
was awakened by the noise of a car horn and looked from the
window to see Valentin S. LOGINOV and Vladislav S. KORMUSHKIN
blowing the horn of their car in the driveway of the Embassy.
Both Soviets were drunk and were yelling for the gato guard
(who happened to be SILNIKOV) to open the gate for them.
They were driving car 337-D (LEONOV's) or 336-D (KORMUSHKIN's).
Subject returned to his bed and did not see them leave the
Embassy.
3. Since both LOGINOV and KORMUSHKIN live in apartments
outside the Embassy and since they would not willingly go
to the Embassy at 3 a.m. while drunk, it is likely that they
were working when they got drunk and therefore had no fear
of being reprimanded for it. They may have returned to the
Embassy to make a report or to secure some classified materials
before going home. Both men replaced known KGB officers.
and both work under Pavel YATSKOV.
}
4. I set our next meeting 24 February.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
FROM
SUBJECT
COS
KUBARK ONLY.
Charles G. MUELLER, U.S. Embassy (Economics
Section) Officer
1. Reference is made to LIENVOY (three conversations
on 12 and 13 January 1966) reports of conversations of
Subject with Valentin LOUGINOV, Soviet Embassy Officer,
and conversations of Mrs. Edith STENSBY (Citizenship,
U.S. Embassy) with Soviets concerning a proposed visit
by Subject's wife and daughter to the USSR.
2. Paul Dillon and I advised Minister Boonstra (who
was Acting Charge) on 14 January 1966 of this proposed
visit and of the conversations we had learned about.-
3. Mr. Boonstra had not previously heard of this.
proposed visit of Mrs. MUELLER to the USSR. He said he
would (without divulging CAS as the source) look Into this.
4. Later on 14 January 1966, Mr. George VARROS told
me of the proposed trip. He said the Ambassador had
personally approved: It (Mr. Boonstra later also confirmed
this)..
5. VARROS also said he thought it "not good" for
Mrs. MUELLER to make such a trip. He said (Confidentially)
that she gets really drunk quite often and she talks
about anything and everything she knows about. For
example, she told at a party (when she was practically
"blotto") about MUELLER's "taking pictures all over Mexico
for CIA!"
+
6. VARROS WIll give Mrs. MUELLER a pre-briefing,
(defensive briefing) just prior to her departure. She will
(and VARROS thinks this is wrong) be travelling on a

Wednesday, 6. April: SILNIKOV arrived about 1330 hrs and had
drink of tequila. While there, a high level Soviet came into
the shop and after he had left SILNIKOV told him that the Soviet
is studying Spanish in the Embassy. (This followed Subject's comment
to SILNIKOV that the Soviet spoke very good Spanish). SILNIKOV.
said that each Wednesday all the Soviets must speak Spanish and
those who refuse to do this must pay a fine. With the fine money
they buy more. Spanish booklets and records. SILNIKOV said that
there are some Soviets who simply refuse to learn Spanish or
Mexican customs and that these people will probably not be sent
abroad again. Commented that this would be a shame since Mexico
has such excellent beaches, weather and everything is so inexpensive:
here. He left the shop about 1430 hrs. Subject was about to
close his shop at 2100 hrs when Valentin S. LOGINOV came into
the store. He asked if he could use Subject's phone and then
made a long distance call to Cuernavaca and spoke to someone in
Spanish. Subject could not hear what was being said but got
the phone number Cuernavaca 2-30-65. (I told Subject to bring
me the phone bill when it arrives so that I can double check the
number.)

25 March 1966.
CONTACT REPORT -
SUBJECT:
Dr. Ernst GOEBEL
1
Subject called me on 23 March to report that he had
learned a little which might interest me. Wo made an appointment
to meet in his office at 1700 the same day. The meeting lasted
for 20 minutes.
'
2. Subject stated that at 1200 hours on Sunday, 20 March,
LOGINOV came to the French Club. He was accompanied by his wife
whose salient features were redish hair which could be died and
very generous proportions, "a typically stout Russian woman."
There was also another Soviet couple with them. The man was
described as very blond, bōyish haircut with a part, not quite
as tall as LOGINOV (ca 5'9"), with a solid muscular build, like
a weight lifter. His apparent age was 25 to 35. His wife was
dark haired, normal figure and also young. The two couples had
three children with them all in the 4-6 bracket. Subject did not
remember their sexes since he was concentrating on the adults.
(COMMENT: I first thought that the second Soviet would be KÖRMUSHKIN
but. Subject insisted that he did not wear glasses (KORMUSHKIN
always wears glasses). However, Subject's description fits
GORLITSYN and wife perfectly. I will take pictures to the next
meeting for confirmation.
-
3. Subject stated that upon arrival the two men went into
the locker room and emerged in shorts. The women were already
dressed in shorts. They had their own badminton rackets and
repaired to a side lawn where they played badminton until Subject
left at 1330. During the period 1200 to 1330 they did not contact
anybody but simply played badminton among themselves.
tuy
Upon leaving Subject spotted LOGINOV's car in the parking
lot noting the make, color and license plates.
5. Subject was apologetic about the paucity of his information
but I encouraged him and told him it was a fine start. Subject
said that he had briefed his wife on LOGINOV and she will be on
the lookout for him during the week. Subject appeared to be very
much interested in pursuing this subject for me and gave everý
indication that he will keep working on it.
