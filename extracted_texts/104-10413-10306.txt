Re International Conference on Diagnosis
and Treatment of Radioactive Poisoning,
Vienna, Aust. 15-18 Oct 62. "Most
interesting aspect of meeting was conduct
and contributions of Prof. MOSKALEV of
USSR Academy of Sciences. His subject was
listed as "Uptake and Retention of
Plutonium in Man"; no abstract was
presented. When he spoke he changed the
title to "Problems of Kenetics of Uptake
and Retention of Radioisotopes." His
paper presented nothing new and can be
described as elementary. He apparently
spoke no English.

MOSKALEV participated in Second Int'l
Symposium on Delayed Effects of Bone
Seeking Radio Nuclides, Sun Valley,
Idaho, arriving two days early. He
had travelled alone to Sun Valley and
apparently was able to use his knowledge
of English language to get along on his
own. However, he complained to Chairman
of conference that he did not know enough
English to read his paper which also
required condensation because it was too
long for the time allowed. A colleague
who had known MOSKALEV from previous meet-
ings said MOSKALEV's knowledge of English
improved greatly after a few drinks.
However, he did not drink at all during
this conference. He did mention that he
had written the English version of the
paper he presented himself. A respected
U.S. scientist with nore experience
than MOSKALEV said he frankly did not
believe MOSKALEV's findings. (Said this
in private.) MOSKALEV attempted to
make propaganda of a report by a West
German. MOSKALEV left the conference a
little upset. He took copious notes on
all papers, which indicated he understood
what was going on. He also took many
pictures with a 35 mm camera. From questions
he asked in private, it was obvious he
understood English quite well. Considerable
time was spent in arranging visit to a U.S.
lab. in route to his home. He took a
different route, without telling anyone
of plans, and did not visit the lab.

MOSKALEV, one of the Soviet delegates
was frequent commentator on other people's

their reports with respect to radiation
lethality.
Sources (3 U.S. scientists) were asked
if they thought MOSKALEV's objectives
were motivated from anything more than
genuine scientific position. They
responded. - "Who can say?" MOSKALEV,
both from papers he gave and his questions

presented no new data. His paper said
nothing specific.

same Transuranium Biology Symposium at
Hanford during week of Sept 26. They
were in San Francisco by chance at the same
time and desired to visit Berkeley on the

coincidental, Drs. MOSKALEV and MASSE
reportedly understood more English than
they could speak. Dr. MOSKALEV was the

1. Photographs of the unidentified man were taken by

into or coming out of both the Cuban and Soviet Embassies in
Mexico City. Copies were provided to the FBI in Dallas.

2. On 17 March 1977, a former member of the Cuban General
Directorate of Intelligence (DGI) recognized photographs of
the unidentifid man as Yuri LNU, a KGB officer, whom he met
in Moscow in 1964 while attending an intelligence course
there. He said that Yuri, a fluent English and Spanish
speaker, was acting as a trouble shooter for the Cuban group,

Any time the Cubans had a problem, Yuri would solve
it for them. Yuri was a good friend of Juan (pseudo) a KGB
officer who taught the Cubans about the Agency (CIA) and the
West German intelligence apparatus. Juan told the DGI member
that he had served in Mexico for about 20 years and in the U.S.

4. On 23 March 1977 several identification experts of
the Disguise and Identification Section of OTS/GAD compared
photos of the unidentified man with photos of ☑ Yuriy
Ivanovich MOSKALEV from the FBI, British Liaison, and CRS.
It was their opinion that MOSKALEV could very likely be
identifiable with the unidentified man.
5. Page 59 of the book "Appointment in Dallas," shows an
Identi-Kit Model composite of an individual who told the
author in London in 1972 that he was involved in the assassination
of President Kennedy. The composite of that individual (code
name "Saul"), whose real name is unknown to the author, bears
a striking resemblance to the photos of Yuriy Ivanovich
MOSKALEV.
According to the author "Saul"identified the
1
picture shown in the Warren Commission Exhibit #237 as
having been taken at the Russian Embassy in Mexico City,
either in the foyer or just outside.

The author of the aforementioned book, Hugh C. McDonald,

McDonald claims

sometime after the Bay of Pigs invasion, and that a colleague
of McDonald told him that "Saul" was an assassin.

1. On 23 March, Chris Hopkins of Latin America Division handcarried
photographs to OTS/GAD for identification comparison. These photos were
examined by the undersigned and two identification experts of the Disguise
and Identification Section.
2. The results of the comparison is as follows:
A. Facial Shape - Close similarities, although there are slight
differences which are probably due to subject's age differences.
B. Chin

Fair similarities-the loss of muscletone due to ageing

C. Hair Line

-
Again good similarity with the natural ravages of
D. Set and Proportion of Eyes and Eyebrows - Close similarities.
(Comparison of eye detail is not possible due to poor photo quality)
E. Nose and Caliper Lines - Close similarities in the nose but
the younger man has no sign of the distinctive caliper lines which extend
from the nose to either side of the mouth on the known Soviet. This could
be explained by loss of muscletone and/or differences in lighting.
F. Mouth - The shape, proportion and expression of the mouth and
the whole area from the tip of the nose to the tip of the chin is perhaps
the most distinctive characteristic of both subjects. Here the similarities
are very close.

G. The proportions of the head, check bones and the body style of
the younger man tend to indicate he is of slavic origin.
3. The results of this type comparison are rarely absolute and are
usually limited by poor photo quality or differences in viewing angle.
With that understood it is our opinion the two subjects of the forementioned
photo comparison could very likely be the same person. If additional
photographs of the subjects, particularly if they are of better quality,
are obtained, we would be happy to examine those as well.

he implied was sufficient, comes from the Soviet Ministry of Health.
The actual Soviet work with the dogs is virtually parallel that in
the US. It involves studying the low level effects of radiation
from inhaled or injected materials.
Moskalev's work appears to be very good as far as it has gone.
But he has only worked with nitrates and chlorides of plutonium,
not with plutonium oxide. Oxides (solid components) should be of
interest to anyone working in this field because the chemical forms
of plutonium are quite useful to know about when doing accident type
studies - to understand plutonium metals it is essential to know
about plutonium oxide. Whether the Soviets are working only with
solutions rather than oxides is not known. It is always possible,
of course, that Soviet work with plutonium oxides is classified.

US biophysicist who had conversations with Yu I Moskalev and Alex
Moiseev during the visit of the two Soviets to the US in October 1971.
1. In October 1971 Dr Yu I Moskalev, Institute of Biophysics, Ministry
of Public Health, Moscow and Dr Alex Moiseev, Central Advanced
Institute for Training of Physicians, Moscow, visited several US
biological and biophysical research facilities. During one of these
visits it was learned from Moskalev that he is the Chairman of the
USSR equivalent to the US National Council on Radiation Protection.
In this position, Moiseev is Moskalev's secretary.

Hoiseev was a difficult individual to figure out, He stated that his
training is in health physics and that his job in the USSK is to be
informed at all times of the status of US health physics and radiation
protection programs. He said that he reads the US journal "Health
Physics" regularly as well as other Western radiation research journals.
Although in discussions with Moiseev he appeared to be technically
competent, he kept very close to Moskalev and rarely let him out of
his sight. If Moiseev is Moskalev's "guardian" (as he appeared to be)
he let his own guard down during a cocktail party hosted by Dr David M
Taylor, Department of Biophysics, Institute of Cancer Research, Belmont
During the course of the evening Moiseev consumed countless gin
and tonics until he could barely articulate. Moskalev, on the other
hand, sipped one or two drinks all evening.

Moskalev was a very adept diplomat. He finds it easy and
convenient to adopt his conversation to whatever kind of group he is
with. He talked at considerable length about the role of women in the
Soviet economy and mentioned that his own wife is a pathologist.
was always much freer in his conversation when Moiseev was out of
hearing.
In terms of his professional work, Moskalev stated that he has a
program in the USSK of exposing dogs to various doses of radiation
to learn the biomedical effects of radiation. It is a program quite
similar to that at the Lovelace Foundation in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
The major difference being that whereas the Lovelace inhilation
experiments involve only the beagle dog, the Soviets do not use a
controlled breed, but rather use mongrels. Moskalev's budget, which

The two visitors presented the Soviet papers in English (Dr. Moiseev
speaks English quite well) and participated in the discussions of
other papers.
The visitors were already acquainted with many
attending the Symposium so informal discussions were very common and
apparently productive. Representatives from all major U. S. labor-
atories working on the transuranium elements and from the Atomic Energy
Commission were able to meet with the Soviet visitors. The visitors
related current status of their studies on biological effects of
plutonium in their formal presentations and in their discussions.
Their manuscripts have been received and will be published in the
Symposium proceedings. During the week, they met with Dr. R. C.
Thompson, Symposium Co-chairman to discuss editing of their
manuscripts.
Visit to Life Sciences Laboratory
On October 1, Drs. Moskalev and Moiseev were escorted to the 331
Building by W. J. Bair. Discussions with the staff occurred during
the day in the conference room with visits to various laboratory
facilities occurring as necessary.

Dr. J. F. Park - Past, present, and future experiments on the
biological effects of inhaled plutonium in laboratory animals;
therapeutic removal of inhaled plutonium, and USSR recommendations
to the ICRP to lower plutonium MPC's were discussed. These Soviet
scientists have completed more work on the biological effects of
inhaled plutonium in animals than any other research group except
our own laboratory. The interchange of experimental methods, results,
and concepts was valuable for planning our future research and
evaluating the results of past and present research.
Since they
have reported biological effects of inhaled plutonium in experimental
animals at extremely low exposure levels and recommended to the ICRP
that limits of exposure should be lowered, the opportunity to
understand and evaluate their experimental results, interpretation,
and logic in making their recommendations was very useful.
-
Dr. V. H. Smith Drs. Moiseev and Moskalev were reasonably well
acquainted with the field of therapy for plutonium poisoning but
not intimately in terms of details or recent Soviet literature; the
former because his field was more on the ecological side, and the
latter because he has concentrated on radiation effects and ceased
active work on removal about ten years ago. Dr. Moskalev was inter-
as removal agents
ested in our plans to test phosphorothioic acids with DTPA as an
and mentioned his own work on the removal of 144 Ce with DTPA as an
example of THA riming of treatment. Hu staled DTPA was given i.v.
to humans in the USSR, not by inhalation, and that Zn-DTPA was not
used or being experimented with. The latter is difficult to believe
due to his former close relationship with Dr. Catsch. He was not
satisfied with the lack of side effects of multiple DTPA treatments
and said that some problems with bone in long-term experiments could
be due to DTPA but he wasn't aware of the details. Answers to questions
about other treatments than DTPA, experience in treating humans, or
future plans were not obtained because presumably this was not a
primary research concern of Dr. Moskaley, although he did state
there was considerable research effort in this field.
238.
Dr. C. L. Sanders discussed our low-level inhaled
Pu02 studies
(life-span), metabolism of plutonium and cellular interaction with
Pu02 particles. The Russians were particularly informative in
describing their low-level life span studies with 239Pu. It was
learned that Dr. Moiseev is primarily a radioecologist who worked
in Siberia and is familiar with oil pipe lines and associated
ecological problems such as arctic and lake pollution problems.
Dr. J. E. Ballou discussed their studies with soluble plutonium
compounds, comparative metabolism and effects of DTPA, and our
americium, plutonium, and cerium work. Dr. Moskalev had tried
inhaled EDTA therapy many years ago to no avail. He was interested
in our work with age effects on gut absorption and wanted to know
why the very young absorb more plutonium. He agreed there is
prolonged gut transit time and different intestinal morphology in

SUBJECT: Theory re MOSKALEV, Yuriy Ivanovich and
Unidentified Man
That Yuriy Ivanovich MOSKALEV might be identifiable with
the "unidentified man" going into and coming out of the Soviet
Embassy in Mexico City in October 1963. The "unidentified man"
was recently identified by SLIPSTREAM as a KGB type by name of
"Yuri" whom he knew in Moscow in 1964.
According to travel records MOSKALEV was in the
USSR in 1964.; in the U.S. in October 1963 .
MOSKALEV functions officially as a Soviet scientist
and often attends international conferences. He
has been in contact with known GRU Soviet diplomat in
the U.S.
MOSKALEV bears a striking resemblance to composite of
"Saul" in book Appointment in Dallas who claims he was involved
in the assassination of President Kennedy. "Saul" claims:
he crossed border into U.S. illegally and was in
Dallas on 20 November.
That he had been to Mexico City, had a contact in
Soviet Embassy there, in 1963, and that he knew the
identity of OSWALD because he (OSWALD) had been
fingered to him in Mexico City.

During the week, in addition to participating in the Symposium
social functions. they were guests in the homes of Dr. W. S. Bola,

and Pufety Division, 0. 5. Atomic Energy Commission,
Richland, Drs. W. J. Bair and C. L. Sanders. These occasions were
enjoyable for the hosts and, apparently, for the visitors. Dr.
Moskalev is an excellent chess player and very patiently played chess
with both adults and children. Dr. Moiseev was interested in current
fashions and consumer products. Mrs. Bair gave him the current Sears
and Roebuck Christmas catalog as an example of consumer products.
He was familiar with the mail order concept but we could not determino
for certain that it is common in the USSR. Both Drs. Moskalev and
Moiseev have dachas near Moscow which indicate they are well up the
status ladder in USSR science, but it was also obvious that Dr.
Moskalev's dacha is a level above Dr. Moiseev's.

The visitors also expressed interest in our standard of living.
visits to our homes seemed to dispel some doubts they might have had
about our standard of living. They seemed particularly to enjoy
the opportunity to meet our children.
Comment
All those having an opportunity to meet with our Soviet guests were
impressed by their congeniality, willingness to discuss their
research, interest in our family life, and the spirit of good will

DCHI 00-A(S) 322/33488-70
13 Nov 70
1. In September 1970, Dr. Yuri Ivanovich Moskalev visited a
US facility devoted to research in the field of nuclear medicine.
Dr. Hoskalev was born on 23 July 1920 in Igumnobo, USSR, which is
near Kalinin. In 1922 his family moved to Leningrad, He has lived
in Moscow since 1948. In 1958 he became the head of a division
comprised of approximately 30 people at the Institute of Biophysics,
Soviet Ministry of Public Health, Moscow. He is the best known
investigator of the metabolism and toxicity of radioelements in the
Soviet Union and has published a number of papers and reviews on
this subject. During his visit, he outlined his as yet unpublished
experiment on skin carcinogenesis in rats (dosage administered to
the body surface by Sr90 -90 plaques on the sides of the cage) and
reported two percent tumors of the skin and some mammary tumors
after a 245 rad 'exposure. It is obvious that he is a careful and
trustworthy worker.
2. Moskalev is conversant with English but not fluent and has
come difficulty in finding the correct English words; however, with
a little patience, scientific communication is very satisfactory.
He is genial, frank, and possesses a good sense of humor. He prefers
Leningrad to Moscow, considering the former to be a more traditional.
and cultured city. His chief recreational diversion is his dacha,
near Moscow, to which he sometimes, travels by skis in winter (a dis-
tance of approximately 20 kilometers).
3. Dr. Moskalev has visited the United States on two previous
occasions; once attending the Sun Valley Symposium in 1967 and again
for the Annual Hanford Biology Symposium in 1969. He has traveled
to other places outside the Soviet Union and was present at a
meeting sponsored by the IAPA in Vienna in 1964.

REPORT ON VISIT OF FOREIGN SCIENTISTS, OCTOBER 4, 1971 3318.
There were four guests in the group:
Dr. (Prof) Yuri I. Moskalev; Inst. of Biophysics, Ministry of Public
Health, Moscow.
6002547
Dr. Alexei A. Moiseev; Central Inst. for Advanced Medical Studies, Moscow
Dr. Jean-Claude Nenot; CEA, Centre D'Etudes Nuclaires, Fontenay-aux-
Roses, France.
Dr. R. Masse,; CEA as above.
The four visitors were not traveling together, but by coincidence were
participants at the same Transuranium Biology Symposium at Hanford during
the week of Sept. 26. They were in San Francisco by chance at the same
time and desired to visit Berkeley on the same day.
Mrs. Ann Low-Beer picked up the four guests in San Francisco and brought
them to the Donner Laboratory where they were greeted by Dr. John Lawrence.
Drs. Donald Van Dyke, James McRae, and Howard Parker took them on a short
tour of the Anger camera facility and whole-body counting and scanning
equipment. The current uses and potential in medical diagnosis were dis-
cussed. Major questions concerned the use of these instruments in monit-
oring and assessing the extent of persons contaminated with radionuclides
in industrial accidents.
Lunch was attended by Dr. Hardin Jones, the four guests, Drs. Van Dyke and
Parker, and Dr. Patricia Durbin, who acted as hostess and guide through
the day. Topics discussed at lunch were centered about the Transuranium
symposium. The efficacy of two new techniques to remove lung contamina-
tion by alpha-emitting isotopes was considered. The two techniques are
lung lavage and aerosolized cheating agents, particularly DTPA.
A tour of Bldg. 74 followed lunch. Three of the visitors are biologists--
Drs. Moskalev and Nenot are physicians, and Dr. Masse is a veterinarian
and all deal with animal experiments or the interpretation of the results
of animal experiments. They were much interested in how one achieved
and managed a "biologically clean" rodent colony, in the minimum mainte-
nance rabbit rooms, and the cage-washing facilities. There was some
discussion about the 90-Sr-injected monkeys, there exposure levels, years
of follow-up, and the essential absence of biological effects at the
dose levels in the study.
A two-hour general discussion between and among the four guests and Dr.
Durbin followed the building tour. The chief topics discussed were how
to explain the observed differences in the metabolism of the transuranic
elements among species. The usefulness and verifiability of models of
human Pu metabolism were considered at great length. New areas of re-
search in internal emitters problems were considered including the influ-
ence of age on local dose and ultimate biological end-points; the useful-
ness of common experiments with various species particularly those with
known variations in iron metabolism, bone formation rates and liver func-
tion.

Dr. Durbin proposed a collaborative effort with two of Dr. Moskalev's
colleagues. They have collected data on human skeleton weights, but
now do not have the time or interest to write up their material. Dr.
Durbin has collected all of the 19th century and early 20th century
human bone weight data and would like to add the modern Russian material
to the set. Dr. Moskalev agreed to propose a joint article with his
colleagues looking towards publication in an international journal. He
sur rested that the original data would be forwarded in any case as soon
as it could be copied.
In the late afternoon the visitors toured (briefly) the Bevatron guided
by Ralph Thomas%; the californium separation facility guided by Francis
McCarty; and the Hi-lac guided by Al Ghiorso. Dr. Moiseev, who is a
physicist, was very much intrigued by the proposal to make an advanced
scientific instrument by joining the Bevatron and the Hi-lac. Dr. Moska-
lev was not interested in how the machines worked, "physics was not his
Tield he said, but asked what he as a biologist might do in the nature
of radiobiology experiments with such machines.
Dr. Moskalev regretted that it had not been possible to visit with Dr.
Tobias. (We could probably have fit in a few minutes or made arrange-
ments for the following day, but I had run them ragged with sight-seeing
the day before, Monday was very full, and frankly they were exhausted
and needed rest. pwd). They would also have liked to visit the Medical
Services group. Mrs. Low-Beer tried to fill them in on the duties and
routine of that group.
Comments on money, budgets, problems of communication, demands on time
such as committees, etc. ran through all of the conversations. Dr. Nenot
and Dr. Moiseev spoke English and understood it well. Dr. Mokkalev and
Dr. Masse understood more English than they could speak. All four are
chiefly occupied with radiation protection and especially with problems
raised by internal emitters. Dr. Moskalev is his country's representa-
tive on the ICRP internal dose committee. They all forsee the develop-
ment of nuclear power in their countries at a fast pace. This obviously
includes, as they were careful to point out, Pu fast breeders, hence
the overriding interest in Pu and its transplutonium contaminants.
The Russian visitors will be guests of the AEC Division of Biology and
Medicine in Washington. (I feel certain we will receive good marks as
hosts and as scientists. pwd).
One further point needs to be added. Although nuclear medicine is not
a cuurent specialty in either country, and the use of nuclear medical
techniques, especially as diagnostic tools, is very limited, the two
physicians indicated thay they personally were much interested, and there
was a definite trend in both countries towards more and more use of
such tools. "It is coming", they said.

1. The Soviet delegation to the Second International Congress on Radiation
Protection arrived several days late. As a consequence, the only presen-
tation from the USSR personally attended was a paper: entitled, "Disorders
in Embryonal Development of Rats after Injection of 131," by AM Lyaginskaya,
Y D Parev and S N Sinitsyana. Since this same experiment has been conducted/.

The most interesting work presented at the meeting from a personal point
of view was that of Professor J Lafuma, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France. He is
charged with the responsibility of setting the plutonium protection standards
and removal techniques after exposure to plutonium for all of France. Lafuma's
most impressive work involves the success he has had in removing copious
amounts of plutonium and other transuranium products from humans using DTPA.
:-
Lafuma explained that from his point of view he was concerned with only
two primary aspects of human contact with plutonium, inhalation and wounds.
His studies have shown, of course, that the earlier treatment is begun the
better the results; but also he has found it easier to decontaminate an
area of the body exposed to plutonium through contact or a wound than to
remove it from the lungs. Lafuma has used intravenous injection exclusively
for the treatment of wounds and finds that a very significant amount of the
transuranium particles are discharged from the body in urine. For the treatment
of inhaled particles, Lafuma has used both DTPA aerosols and injection. He find
his results from injection are better than the use of aerosols, even in lung
decontamination.

US citizen; a professor and researcher in radiation biology at a US univer...
[This report was prepared for submission to the US Atomic Energy Commission
and is disseminated in accordance with DCID:2/3.]
A US radiation biology researcher attended both the Biology and Ecology of
Polonium and Radiolead Conference, Sutton, UK, 30 April - 1 May 1970, and
the Second Congress of the International, Radiation Protection Association,
Brighton, UK. 3-8 May 1970.
t
The nature of the Sutton meeting was such that few significant scientific
positions were taken: however, in general, the quality of the paners was
very high. The scheduled Soviet participants: P V Ramzayev and/FNU] Moskalev
were presumably not permitted by the USSR to attend: D Panov (Yugoslavia)
was in the US, and D Djuric (Yugoslavia) did not attend for unknown reasons.
The countries represented were UK (26), Italy (5), France (1), Sweden (2),
Poland (1), South Africa (1), and the US (7).
To the extent that the proper "half-life for lead in man" was discussed,
the consensus appeared to be that (a) the loss rate can not be represented
as a single exponential; (b) the presently available data on baboons and
beagle dogs does not extend for a sufficient period of time to provide a
measure of the "last slow rate loss constant"; (c) it is likely that lead
and radium loss rates will differ because of the selective reutilization of
Pb in bone. D Barltrop (UK) and US researchers have been performing
experiments which indicate that lead is not bound by red cell membranes,
but at sites in the cell interior.

significant consideration to biological researchers engaged in dose

some propaganda of this report by asking in a small group, "Why did you
do this?" almost accusing Spiez of doing it himself.

Moskalev left the conference a little upset. It was suggested that he
might visit a US laboratory en route home, and considerable time was
expended to arrange this visit. However, he apparently took a different
route and made no effort to tell anyone of his plans, and he did not
visit the laboratory. He took copious notes on all papera, which indicated.

Kennedy.
that two hours after the assassination he, "Saul",
was out of the U.S. That he used limp as a

QUESTIONS
1. Could MOSKALEV be "Saul"?
2.
Could MOSKALEV, therefore, be mystery man who
boarded plane in Mexico City for Havana on 22
November 1963?
3. Was assassination a Soviet comspiracy without
Cuban knowledge?
RECOMMENDATION
1. Can we obtain voice tape of MOSKALEV, since he
has delivered speeches at scientific conferences
in U.S. and abroad?
2.
If so, could we arrange to have McDonald (unwittingly)
hear it, to see if he recognizes it as that of "Saul"?

1 I was quite surprised when I arrived in Sun Valley, Idaho, to participate
in the International Symposium on Delayed Effects of Bone Seeking Radio
Nuclides to find that Dr Yuriy I Moskalev of the Institute of Physics.
had arrived two days earlier. Moskalev had traveled alone to Sun
Valley and apparently was able to use his knowledge of the English language
to get along on his own. However, he complained to the chairman of the
conference that he did not know enough English to read his paper which also
required condensation because it was too long for the time allowed. A..
colleague who had known Moskalev from earlier meetings said Moskaley's
knowledge of English improved greatly after a few drinks. However, during
this conference, he did not drink at all. He did mention, however, that
he had written the English version of the paper he presented himself and
said he could read and write English quite well but was deficient in the
spoken language.
2. Moskalev's paper concerned the results of a series of experiments utilizing
an unusually large number of rats and mice. The numbers he used were far in
excess of those that would be used in a western laboratory. These figures
were undoubtedly meant to impress his western associates.
The data he pre-
sented was primarily on Strontium 90. His findings indicated that Strontium
90 was much more toxic than had been reported anywhere in western literature
and that it was more carcinogenic than has been previously reported. His
technique was almost exclusively injections of radio nuclides. The control
he had on his animals was not explained, but very likely was very poor. He
claims to have been able to induce cancer in laboratory animals at permissible
exposure levels for atomic workers in the US. The animals were not examined
for radioactivity, only for the existence of cancer. A respected US scien-
tist with much more experience than Moskalev flatly stated, in private, that
he did not believe Moskalev's findings. Moskalev did not ask questions during
the question periods. However, he did talk privately to several scientific
reporters after their presentations.

knew. From the USSR viewpoint, he stated that no objections would
exist, but I doubt that this was true. He was in Sun Valley four days;
immediately after the conference he went to Salt Lake City, and then
on to Montreal Canada. His schedule allowed for several days in

I attended the Second International Symposium on "Delayed Effects of
Bone Seeking Radionuclides", Sun Valley, Idaho 12-14 Sept 67.
2. An interesting paper was presented by Yuri I Moskalev, USSR on "Some
Late Effects of Radionuclide Damage Dr. Moskalev was not expected
at the meeting and he came alone, arriving two days early. He had
furnished no brief and it was a surprise to hear his paper.

I was unaware that research such as he presented was being done in the
USSR. His demonstration was a good piece of scientific work, that is,
his procedures and results in pathological consequences of radioisotopes
fit reasonably well with our procedures and results in the US. He did
not present anything new in his paper, and it must certainly reveal
that they are a few years behind the US in biology and radioisotope
studies and applications. They are apparently still testing the toxi-
city of radio elements, which we have already established and accept,
knowing the effects and using them accordingly. In other words, we
are through with his reported work, feeling that it is completed; ap-
parently they are not. Else, they don't yet know the toxicity bound-
aries, are still experimenting along these lines, or are experimenting
to see how much more they can learn. But his paper reveals remarkable
research.
Dr. Moskalev understands English reasonably well, but speaks it less
well. Therefore, his appearance alone at the conference was even more
unusual.

The meeting gave me an opportunity to renew my acquaintance with David
Shugar of the Warsaw Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Academy
of Sciences of Poland. Though a highly competent scientist and a dedi-
cated Communist, Shugar seems to be short of funds. The organizing
committee of the Congress sent him money to insure his presence at Cortina
d'Ampezzo. He and his wife drove by automobile from Poland to Italy.
Shugar introduced me to one of his students KL Wierzchowski.
In per-
forming the introduction Shugar declared the young man was highly capable
and had a brilliant future.

5. The International Committee of Photobiology had an executive committee
meeting at Cortina d''Ampezzo. It was decided to hold a photobiology
symposium in the late summer of 1967 on the Island of Hvar, Yugoslavia.
The symposium will emphasize photosynthesis. The general plan calls
for participation by about 100 scientists, with emphasis being placed
on invitations to the younger scientists in the Sov Bloc. The chief
organizer of the forthcoming symposium is Maria Drakulic, Laboratory of
Cellular Biochemistry, Institute "Rudjer Boskovic", Belgrade..

1. About one third of the Soviets expected at the Third International Con-
gress of Radiation Research put in an appearance. The papers I heard
were disappointing. In my opinion the Soviets are confining themselves
to a narrow range of interests in their radiation research. In Session
6002547 32, which was concerned with ingested or injected radioisotopes, a paper
written by Yu I Moskalev and Y N Streltsova of the Institute of Biophysics
of the Ministry of Public Health, USSR, did not impress me.
A very poor
reading marked the presentation of the paper prepared by A Tumanyan of the
Gamaleya Institute for Epidemiology and Microbiology, Academy of Medical
Sciences of the USSR. The paper was given in a hurried and garbled fashion
by a person who obviously was not a scientist. After the session ended,
I talked to Tumanyan regarding her radiation experiments with monkeys.
A woman about 45 years of age, Tumanyan had no English but spoke excellent
French. She was quite enthusiastic about her work which I in turn con-
sidered commonplace.

2. It appears to me that the Soviets have a strong tendency toward experi-
ments that enable them to study radiation effects on large animals.
They do not seem interested in radiation response the effect on tissue;
on the other hand, they concern themselves with metabolic effects; which
are important because they are related to the ability to suppress immunity
mechanisms. They stress immunology and transplants.

is something on which I can speak somewhat as an expert. Although
people may claim to have this, I do not think anyone has it,
including the Soviets. One can find biological criteria at low doses,
1 Mether they have meaning beyond the limited experiment is the big
✓ption, you see.
W results presented on cosmic and Van Allen belt radiation effects on
Dost organisms in such areas as lethal, metabolic, developmental and
matic?
Tothing.
More conclusions presented on determining the relative biologic effective-
ness factor of biologic material when exposed to radiation from nuclear
testing?
Main, I can speak with some certitude. There is no conclusion about the
elative biological effect of this factor. People will argue about it,
at there is no conclusion. The Soviets had some things to say about it,
mt i was thoroughly confused about their position. There are two ways
of minking about the RBE factor. One is from the viewpoint of theoretical
biology which is interested in the why of differences of biological
effectiveness, and this becomes one of the parameters of experiment. The:
otuer is the question of an empirical number that one can use in handling
questions of judgment about radiation exposure in man. With regard to the
questions of judgment, I think that most biologists would agree that we
do not have any reliable and valuable RBE factors. We have numbers that
reprosent what we might be afraid of, more than anything else.
Did the Soviets say anything bearing on physical measurements of radia-
tion in space in terms of relative biological effectiveness factor and
implications for future manned space flights?
One of the Soviet delegates, [Yu.I) Moskalev was a frequent commentator.
other people's work and he made a practice of denigrating the reports
these people with respect to radiation lethality. His comment was to
the ofrect that the studies of radiation Tethality done usually in small
zainals were not to the point, were not germane to problems in the
Human case, and that to be useful these studies should be done in animals
closer to man.
What is your critique of his argument?
Well, a mass of work has been done with the smaller animals in variuos
laboratories and we are beginning to get certain generalities about the
nature of radiation injury, or at least certain kinds of radiation
injury, and therefore I think it is worthwhile to pursue it. As you
wight imagine, I presented a paper on radiation lethality and was among
those to whose work Moskalev objected.
Do you think Moskalev's objections were motivated from anything more than
a genuine scientific position?
Aho can say? In their published work the Soviets show a lot of attention
to effects in the central nervous system-they are very interested in
this and US people have tended to ignore this area. So conceivably
Hockalev is oriented to CNS work and physiological functions, I do not
know. But quite a lot of the Soviet work has a different orientation)
from western work--at least their published stuff.

of energy, on the order of one kiloton or greater?
To the best of my knowledge there was no formal discussion of any
nuclear reactions, as such. The great majority of the material presented
had to do with biological effects, and the physicists at the Symposium,
were using high energy machines largely to produce the radiation that'
would be comparable to solar flare radiation. *.
Was anything presented on effects of space radiation on the human body?
:
A. I can recall no Soviet references to the Vostok flights. The two Soviet
speakers confined their references to purely laboratory observations.
There was a number of US papers, and as I recall one from France,
oriented to space flight conditions, however.
Were there results in the use of drugs in radiation protection?
A. I do not recall anyone's discussing drugs--Soviet or other. And I think
that although research in drugs is continuing many radiobiologists are
not very optimistic about their value. This is something many of us.

mostly as regards tumors. So they are interested in carcinogenesis and
in fact Moskalev asked me a question following my paper on carcinogenesis,
I said nothing on acute, short-term effects of low doses of radiation,
so presumably they are not concerned with these,
'
31. People from other countries, and particularly the US, reported work
xving to do with low dose effects and reliable biological indicators
for low ranges of dose using the chromosome aberration methods in human
colls. But the Russians had nothing to say about this particular thing
and seem not to be working on it as yet.
h
:
In your opinion, what is the level of accomplishment, worldwide, in this
Matter of getting reliable indicators of biological damage?
Insofar as I know, the most sensitive and reliable biological index for
damage at low dose rates involves the study of chromosome abnormalities.
The approach was developed in the US and is being used extensively here
and in England, and other countries are taking it up. Moreover, I think
that in radiobiology in general, in almost any question you could ask,
the west and particularly the US and England are very much in the fore-
front. Prom what I know of Russian radiobiology from translations and
Hearsay, the Russians are years behind us, but I exclude their related
physical work from this judgment.
Q. Was there reporting from the Soviets on types of radiation detection
equipment used in the Vostok flights? Did they report findings on the
relative biological effectiveness factor values for neutrons, protons
and cosmic ray attenuations?
A.
34.
Q
35.
A,
35.
Q.
Hell, again, there was no specific mention of this, but the interest in
the relative biological effectiveness factor for neutrons and cosmic
radiation was a major concern of the whole Symposium: the attempt to
Elucidate the FBE factor and particularly the problem with respect to
large animals, like humans, where in the case of neutrons you have a
change in the type of radiation in the interior of the animal. · You do
not have this change with x- gamma rays, but you do have it with fast
neutrons.
How is this neutron change manifested in large animals? :
The neutrons become moderated. As they proceed through the tissue, the
nydrogen in the tissue reacts with the neutrons and there is a change
in the energies taken up. At some point you have gammas. So, the first
few layers of hydrogenous material on the outside of the animal tend to
change the dose, and in the interior, where the important effects occur,
you do not know what the dose is. We talk about mid-line doses,
average doses, but the actual dose in the cells of the bone marrow or the
gut, we do not know yet. This is one of the problems of the RBE and a :
very big one.
[A G] Searle of Harwell reported genetic effects of low dose rate
neutrons in mice finding that there were as many if not more mutations
with low dose rate neutrons than with high dose rate neutrons. His work
is the first direct evidence of the cumulative effect of a prolonged,
or fractionated, low, dose of neutrons. You do not have such an effect
with x- or gamma rays. If you prolong the dose with these, the effect
will be very much less than it would be if you gave the same total dose
in a single fast pulse.
The neutron dose given gradually might have an even more damaging effect.
than if given all at once, is that it?
A. Yes. At least. But the matter is still delicate, for Searle's experiment
was with mice and the question remains whether neutrons, as such, will

Moskalev, both from the papers he gave and his questions and comments
in discussion indicated that he was very sharp, very advanced in his
knowledge of the biological effects of radiation, particularly with
respect to distinguishing among the effects of various energies of
neutrons and the techniques for measuring these energies. I think it
may be safely assumed that the Russians are using very advanced methods
for detecting and measuring the various energies of neutrons--the
dosimetry of neutrons. In the biological effect, I think they are
way behind us. But they are much involved in the potentials of neutron
irradiation and their objectives are, I am sure, the effects of space
radiation on human beings.
25. Actually, [V P] Afanas'yev, who is a physicist, was even more sophisticated
than Moskalev. Afanas'yev's paper was entitled "Production and Investiga-
tion of Dose Fields for Irradiation of Experimental Animals with Protons
of High Energy". His paper showed that both their production of high
energy protons in the laboratory and the measurements of these protons
with respect to animal work is sophisticated. They are advanced in this.
I think this is the distinction to be made: they are more advanced in
the technology of producing high energy radiations and the measurement
of these than they are in biological effects of radiation.

Q.
A.
.A.
Was anything reported on effects of radiation on non-regenerative tissues
such as the brain?
The Russians are very much involved in CNS effects of radiation, but they
presented no data at the Symposium. The paper that Moskalev gave was
a survey of Russian research work on biological action of neutrons and
isotopes. It covered maybe twenty different pieces of work with only
a few sentences for each. It presented no new data and nothing on the
CNS as I recall. Afanas'yev's paper, on the other hand, presented new
data on the production of dose fields with high energy protons.
•
One gets the impression that whereas Russians physics is mechanistic
and quite indistinguishable from ours in that respect, Russian biology
is impregnated with philosophy. Hoskalev, for example, spoke of how
the body "adapts" to radiation in the sense that a single animal adapts.
Most biologists will reserve this word to changes in a species over a
very long period. I suppose you could consider wound healing as
adaptation in a sense. But western biology: sees certain events.
occuring in an organism as the consequence of a wound which can be
described without resort to notions of teleological adaptation.
philosophical tendency has been a damaging element in Russian biology,
I believe,
Were there results in the use of drugs in radiation protection?
This
I can recall nothing on protective drugs from anybody. There was here
and there a reporting of drugs used to enhance the effect of radiation
with respect to tumor treatment..
Was anything presented on the characteristics of a bio-element used for
space radiation detection including the number required for an extended ·
space probe and the method of transmitting information?
I am afraid I do not understand the question.
Q. Was there anything on biological indicators at low ranges of radiation

doses?
There is a tremendous amount of interest in such indicators everywhere.
Moskaley's presentations did not say anything specific except that the
Russians are working on long-term effects of small doses of radiation

or will be moderated and changed into gamma rays. The neutron RBE for
mortality in dogs, as reported from my laboratory and Brookhaven, is
around 1. For small animals like mice it is more like three or four. So
there is this discrepancy, and it may be promising for large animal
research. Harwell, my laboratory, and the Argonne National Laboratory
near Chicago are now setting up to apply low dose rate neutrons in
sheep. This will be new work and should have important results.
•
Were results presented on cosmic and Van Allen belt radiation effects
on test organisms in such areas as lethal, metabolic, developmental and
genetic?
There was nothing on this as far as I know, except for a paper from the
Donner Laboratory people at the University of California, Berkeley
entitled "Some Biological Effects of 730 Mev Protons".
This may
simulate the kind of radiation that occurs in space and this is why
they are playing around with it, you see.
Were conclusions presented on determining the relative biologic effective-
ness factor of biologic material when exposed to radiation from nuclear
testing?
Well, this kind of interest is implied in work with neutrons. With
neutrons there is this question of RBE and it was one of the major
points of discussion at the Symposium.
Did the Soviets say anything bearing on physical measurements of
radiation in space in terms of relative biological effectiveness factor
and implications for future manned space flights?
All I can say is that it is logical to suppose that this is what they
are after: good physical measurements of radiation of a type that
might be anticipated in space.

There was nothing on this.
Did the Soviets report progress in radiation resistant materials and
components for application to long space flight electronic equipment?
This Symposium was all biological, so there was nothing on this.
Was there anything from the Soviets on methods of radiation shielding?
A. It was there by implication. The fact that they were talking about the
investigation of dose fields, the radiation of experimental animals with
protons of high energy, implies that they would be using some kind of
shielding to get the animal exposed.

Due to a misunderstanding in the USSR, the topics covered by the sym
posium were not known sufficiently in advance for Soviet scientists
to contribute papers of other than zucisar toxicology. Therefore,
Soviet Delegate. N Tschesnokow briefly discussed USSR uranim zinë
health practices which included three areas of activity: (1) Maximum
efforts are taken to suppress dust at the source, and mines are well
ventilated; (2) Personnal protective devices; such as respiratory masks.
and filters, are used, and (3) Preventive health or prophylactic pro-
cedures include assignment of mine workers to a sanitarium for one.
month each year. No kidney damage or other pathology apparently has
been seen as a result of uranium mining activities in the USSR. There
was no mention of cancer due to this activity. Four papers' from the
USSR dealt with laboratory studies on the toxicology of internal emi
ters. Most Soviet studies involved intratracheal administration of
the isotopes although it was brought out that the importance of
inhalation as a route of entry is being recognized. The symposium
brought together a world cross section of scientific disciplines for
discussion of uranium mining and milling hazards. Details of all of
this are given in my trip report which follows:

This is apparently due to the high acceptance of data pub-
lished by the University of Rochester. It was pointed out
that the possible contribution of radioactive dust composed
of other than radon daughters was not actually evaluated
in the case of the Schneeburg lung cancers because dust
samples were not collected. Although radon is released by
crushing of ores, radon and radon daughters were not con-
sidered to be a problem in uranium mills of France because
of large work areas and high ventilation rates.
e. Four papers from the USSR dealt with laboratory studies on
the toxicology of internal emitters in general, particu-
larly Cs137, Sr89, Sr90, 91, Ce144, 2r95, N195, Ru106, and
U
uranium and radon. Most studies involved intratracheal ad-
ministration of the isotopes, although a few inhalation
studies were described. These papers were all given by
Dr L N Burykina in the absence of Drs Moskalev, Sanotsky,
Novikova and Kustmieva. They report that 10 to 18 per cent.
of the inhaled radioactivity was found in the lungs of rats
and dogs after exposure, and that five per cent was cleared
by ciliary activity. These data are difficult to evaluate
since the particle sizes of the aerosols were broadly des-
cribed as being between 1 and 4 µs Translocation of the
inhaled radioisotopes was similar to that reported by others.
.
Biological effects were reported only for intratracheal ad-
ministration of Ce144 and Ru106. They report degenerative
inflammation of the lung and aplastic changes in the bone
marrow accompanied by leukopenia in acute stages. In longer
term studies they find chronic pneumonia and degenerative
and proliferative changes of the bronchial epithelium and
connective tissue. They also reported reduction of bone
marrow hematopoiesis and degenerative changes in the liver,
kidney, etc. These occurred after deposition of 1 to 19 µc
Ce 144 in rats, 0.6 to 2.6μc Ce 14/gram of dog, and 0.4 µ c
Ru106/gram of rat. No cardiovascular changes were noted,
but were not specifically studied. The results of studies
with uranium were similar to those reported many times, with
the exception of central nervous system injury which consisted
of changes in conditioned reflexes and in hibitory and ex-
citatory processes. Due to this and relatively high burdens
found in skeleton (3 to 4 per cent) they conclude that uranium
toxicity is not necessarily confined to kidney damage. Kush-
neva's paper on synergistic effects of silica and radon re-
ported previously published data. Silicotic rats were exposed
to 8 c radon." The radon treated silicotic rats showed
more serious clinical symptoms, drop in circulating blood
cells, and more extensive lung pathology than rats treated
with radon or cilica alone.

An excellent paper describing experimental work on the in-
halation of Rn 222 and its decay products was presented by
Dr E Pohl from the University of Innsbruck, Austria. When
Rn was inhaled in equilibrium with RaA, RaB, and RaC the
concentration of daughters in lungs and other tissues were
higher than when the concentrations of RaA, RaB, and RaC
in the inhaled air were less than the equilibrium values.
However, in the latter case the concentrations of daughter
products in the lungs and other tissues were higher than
would be predicted from the concentrations in the inhaled
air. Further experiments are in progress to confirm and
explain these results. Similar, but less extensive, studies
were reported in a paper co-authored by Dr Lafuma of France
and Medjidovic of Yugoslavia.

The most interesting aspect of meeting was conduet and contributions of Prof
Yu I Moskalev of USSR Acad Sci. His subject was listed as "uptake and Retention
O Plutonium in Man"; no abstract was presented. When Prof Moskalev spoke,
however, he changed the title to "Problems of Kinetics of Uptake and Retention
of Radioisotopes. During his presentation, it was suggested that the retention
of multiple dosis of Sr90 in the rat could not be predicted on the basis of
single injection studies. After continual questioning via translation service
(he apparently spoke no English), we concluded he meant by this that the rat
is a continually changing animal. In any event, his paper presented nothing
new and could by described as being rather elementary.
In contrast, Prof Moskalev's questions throughout the four day meeting covered
a wide range of topics, and left one with the impression that he was a competent
individual. In response to questions, however, his answers were far from
satisfactory. He have no specific answers to questions regarding Soviet ex-
perience with radioisotopes in man.

The Symposium on Radiological Health and Safety in Nuclear Materials
Mining and 'Hilling in Vienna, 26-31 Aug 63, did not provide much new
information mainly because the US is so far ahead of the other countries
represented at the symposium in its studies of theṣe subjects. The ES
was actually the only country which presented original material at the
conference. The Soviets sent a small three or four-merber delegat lori
headed by Yuriy Ivanovich Moskalev, a very personable and diplomatica”

apparent sincerity, that the Soviets had misunderstood the exact point
of the meeting and had presented very minor papers.
