Thank you for agreeing to participate in briefing the JFK
Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) to be held on Monday,
17 March, at 2:00 p.m., in 2C06 IP Bldg. I regret the short
notice. As we discussed, the ARRB has asked for information
relating to the creạtion, transmission, and dissemination of
cables and your name instantly came to mind. Their specific
questions are:
1- Can you describe the cable process in place in the Agency
during the
1960-1964 time period?
Prior to 1962 messages were delivered to the DPD
・handled U-Z
Enge/Peg
(Development Products Division) at 1717 H Street or to the
Communications Center at “I” Building. In addition there
"L" Street
also was a Q building that received special traffic.
After 1962 messages came into the CIA Headquarters and
were processed in different areas depending on the
types of traffic.
Imagery traffic would be sent to to a specific floor
14
for the imagery personnel. Intercept and Special Programs
would either be passed to a Special Sections Area of the
Communications Center or to the Cable Secretariat.
2- How did cables come in?
Messages came in from the field via the Brandy Station State
Channels or military channels.
3- How were they decrypted?
Messages were deciphered using a OTT (One Time Tape)
or a OTP (One Time Pad) process.

5. Does OS process security clearances for non-employees (e.g. sources) to receive
access to classified information? What kinds of files are created by this process? How
long are these files maintained. For example, Clay Shaw was given a security clearance
and had access to classified information based on his "responsibilities" as a source for
the Domestic Contacts Division (DCD).
6. Where are records that would describe liaison (etc.) cooperation or operations
between OS and CI located? How are these records organized?
7. Where are records regarding operations that OS participated in or ran located. For
example, where are the OS records on the Castro assassination attempts?
8. How many files did OS have on Oswald? Which OS components maintained files on
Oswald? Why did OS have any files on Oswald?

Types of Questions for DA Records Briefing
March 17, 1997.
1. In Cold Warrior, (p. 52) Mangold refers to a CI secret slush fund which was tightly
controlled by Angleton and never audited by the usual procedures. According to
Mangold, it was this fund which allowed Angleton to run his own operations without
supervision. Did the fund exist? Was this fund ever audited? Are there any records of
CI operational expenses for the period 1959-63?
2. Mangold also refers (p. 53) to an unnamed CI/B&F officer who says he worked for
Angleton from 1958-1964 and never dealt with him directly on a single matter. Is there
a list of B&F officers assigned to the CI Staff from 1959-63. Do their records still exist?
3. We have seen Directorate of Operations monthly operational reports which contain
information on the allocation/distribution of operational funds. Are there other DO or
DA records which reflect how a certain project utilized its funding? Can this type of
information from the early 1960's still be retrieved?
4. What records are kept on disbursements to sources in the field? If, hypothetically,
LHO had received money from the Agency, what records would exist?
Personnel
1. What records are maintained on contract personnel? > OP

UMS
1. For the period between 1955-65, what was the universe of files that OS had on
individuals of groups?
2. How are Office of Security records indexed? card to key punche
(SAG)
3. What was the function of the Office of Security/Security Research Staff (OS/SRS)?
Why were defector records kept in this component? dested point
CI function"
4. In the OS/SRS memo of Oct. 31, 1960, written by Marguerite D. Stevens, the file
numbers of several defectors are listed: "Robert Edward Webster, EE-18854; Lee
Harvey Oswald, MS-11165; Libero Ricciardelli, MS-8295; Vladimir Sloboda, MS-10565;
and Joseph Dutkanicz, MS-10724." What do the "MS" and "EE" file prefixes designate?
How are these designations assigned?

4- What happened from the time a cable was sent from a field
site until it arrived

High Frequency Radio. The message received from Brandy
and relayed to headquarters and then it was decrypted.
The analyst of the Cable Secretariat would then read the
message and match what they read against customer
requirements. They then would have a typist type the
dissemination on the message. The message then would be
picked up from the message center by the various staffs
and or divisions.
5- How were cables disseminated?
See item four.
