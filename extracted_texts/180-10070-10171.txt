Status of Document:
Postponed in Part
Number of releases of previously postponed information: 9
Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors
including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the
absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United
States or to any individual.
Number of Postponements: 5
Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.
Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could
reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of
privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

Gentlemen:
December 28, 1978
Mrs. Anne Paul Wilander is one of the staff members from the Select
Committee on Assassinations who is being terminated as of December 31, 1978,
O per copy of attached letter.
To protect Mrs. Wilander's medical benefits until she secures employment,
she is being restored to the Committee's payroll on January 1, 1979 at the
minimum salary of $100.00 per month allowed under the Rules of the House.
While she will work two days per month to earn the $100.00, she is tech-
nically unemployed.
When she applies for unemployment benefits, the Clerk of the House will
probably respond to your inquiry that she is still employed but at a reduced
salary.
I wanted you to know what the facts are about her continued employment
so that nothing would interfere with her application for unemployment benefits
in case she is not able to secure new employment.
TH:ht
Sincerely yours,
Thomas Howarst
