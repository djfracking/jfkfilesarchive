the counter-intelligence responsibility. And I might have told
the division chief about it, although it was not, it had not
achieved such stature at that point that I would have
necessarily talked to the Division Chief, who I believe at
that time was John Richardson of later Vietnam fame.
It's also possible that the Division Chief in that era
was John Baker, now deceased, who left that division to
become Chief of the PP staff, and that would have been a
normal follow through for me if I had discussed it with John
Baker, my direct Chief, and then to have discussed it with
him when he was my staff chief in the overall political and
psychological staff.
Mr. Baron. Anyone else who would have known about your
approach to Colonel Pash or about
Mr. Hunt. Or his function.
Mr. Baron. Yes, that Colonel Pash was considered to have
assassinations as one of his functions.
Mr. Hunt. We had a Colonel Buffington who at that time
25 was a member of the PP staff, the overall PP staff, and I think

Mr. Hunt. Does this satisfy your request?
Mr. Baron. It does, indeed.
Of all of the individuals that you have just mentioned,
which ones do you know to your own certainty were clearly
knowledgeable of Boris Pash's activities?
Mr. Hunt. Artie Lazarus would be the first one, and
after that I can only speculate. I would have to assume that
Doug Blaufarb acquired knowledge of it, but perhaps he acquired
knowledge through me. I'm not sure. I have made a list of
other people whom I have not mentioned who conceivably, by
virtue of personal contact or functional responsibility, might
well have been aware of Pash's true functional responsibility
within the Agency.
Mr. Baron. Before I ask you to tick off that list, let's
make it clear that all of the names, in addition to Artie
Lazarus, are names that you have given as people who are
likely to have been knowledgeable of Pash's activities because
of their place in the organization structure at that time.
Mr. Hunt. That's correct, or as I have indicated in some
cases, as with the PP labor branch by virtue of physical
proximity to that office.
Mr. Baron. Okay. Why don't you now just run very briefly
through the names of other people who you think could conceivably
have been knowledgeable of Pash's function?
Mr. Hunt. In some cases I'm going to have to give you their

Mr. Hunt. Yes. I think he later went on and had a career
in the Office of Security. Milton Buffington ves.

Anyone else?
Mr. Hunt. Yes, I have the names of three men who unfor-
tunately are dead. I could give those names, though. Mr. C.
Tracy Barnes, Mr. John Baker, who I've already mentioned, and Mr
Lewis W. Thompson. These men were all at one time or another
chiefs of the Agency's PP staff.
Another man now living to the best of my knowledge who
might well have had knowledge of Pash's function was the
then-chief of the Economic Warfare staff of the PP staff and his

Reporting to the Deputy Director for Plans, i.e. Frank

the Counter-Intelligence, Counter-Espionage staff, and of
course the famous staff "D".
Also reporting to the Deputy Director for Plans were all
of the geographical divisions, such as Western Europe, Southeast
Europe, Asia, Near East, and so forth.
Mr. Baron. Now at this point Frank Wisner was DDP,
Richard Helms was his deputy.
Mr. Hunt. Richard Helms was his Chief of Operations.

There's a man named Harold Burris Meyer, who was in the
Psychological Warfare Branch of the PP staff. I believe at
that time there was an International Organizations Branch
which later became the International Organizations Division,
then headed by Cord Myer, Jr., and his Deputy at that time was
Tom Braden, the now-columnist whose wife has just ascended to
the Executive Office Building. There were members of the
Labor Branch, and I'm trying to think of that branch of office
that was down the hall.
There was a labor branch. The people in there might know.
There was a lady lawyer named Carol somebody who was very
knowledgeable about what was going on in that area.

Mr. Baron. Knowledeable about Pash's activities?

16
Mr. Hunt. Well, in the sense that when you have an
adjoining office, you usually pretty much know what the other
17
fellow is doing. Just in that sense, because her function
18
in the labor branch had nothing to do with Pash, to my
19
20
21
knowledge.
What I'm trying to do here is to give you sort of a
congeries of people alive and dead who would have had contact
22
knowledge, at the very least, of what Pash's function was.

Mr. Baron. Were each of these units referred to as

It was about that time that General Cushman was still
assigned to the CIA. I could be wrong about that but I seem
to have a memory of Cushman being around in those days. He
was then a Colonel. I had associated with him. In fact, we
had shared an office at one time, but that was several years
earlier. I would place it about early 1949. But I'm quite
sure that Cushman was around in that period of time and
involved with the PP staff, though what his function was I
don't know.
Now there are alive two close friends of mine who were
then members of the PP staff, Joseph Bryan Ill and Finis Farr.
These are men who in effect established the PP staff for
Frank Wisner and then left to go on to other things. They
13
are both well known writers.
14
Mr. Baron. Let me just return to one name that you
15
mentioned and that is William Harvey.
16
Did you
first, generally, what was the nature of your
17
operational relationships to William Harvey after this period?
18
410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
Did you have any?

20
Mr. Hunt. I never had any, no. In fact, I've only seen
him once in my life, to the best of my recollection.

24
Mr. Baron. As you may know, William Harvey was tasked
in 1961 with setting up an executive action capability at
the CIA, tasked originally by Richard Bissell to carry out
assassinations if required.

the then Chief of Western Europe Division, of which Germany
was a functional part and the Chief of Operations of Western
Europe should know.
I would think that Jim Angleton, who would have had
direct knowledge and always was the Chief of the CI/CE staff.
The Chief of base in Berlin, if in fact Pash conducted any
activities in that area, certainly the Chief of base in
Berlin would have been knowledgeable about it.
Also, the Chief of base at Pollack, which was where we
had the Golden Operation going on. I don't know whether
Bill Harvy, that is William Harvy, at that time was Chief of
Operations far Berlin or whether he was simply running the
tunnel, but Harvy might well have some knowledge of Pash.
I would certainly assume that when we're talking about
liquidations and that sort of thing that the Agency's overall
Office of Security somewhere within it must have been involved,
such German Division personnel as might be available today,
West German, and I would also suggest that General Cushman might
be knowledgeable for this reason.

because we're going to slop over into this other matter that

Mr. Baron. Well, why don't we hold off then, except
that for this one question, which is are you aware of any
involvement that Dr. Gunn had in assassination planning?
Mr. Hunt. No, I'm not because I'm just not familiar

reason, I'm not aware of any involvement that Dr. Gunn might

have had.
Mr. Baron. Let's return now to the point of departure,
which was your conversation with Colonel Pash and the events
that led up to it.
Who were your supervisors that gave you the impression
that Colonel Pash was prepared to carry out assassinations?
Mr. Hunt. I wish I could give you a distinct name. I
think I covered that in an impressionistic way by saying that
Tracy Barnes and John Baker, who were at different times
sequentially chiefs of the PP staff, it seems to me that Barnes
was probably the one who indicated that Pash had such a
capability.
I know that I did not get it from Blaufarb and I'm
quite sure that my information did not come from within the
Southeast Europe Division. It must have come accordingly
from the Political and Psychological staff, the contacts there,
and I would have to say Tracy Barnes or John Baker are the

most likely.
Mr. Baron. And neither of those two men are alive today?
Mr. Hunt.
That's right.
Mr. Baron. Did whoever gave you the information about
Boris Pash indicate to you that there were any other units
in the CIA that could take care of such problems by means of
assassination?

No.

the function, if indeed it existed, and I believed it then
to have existed as I do today, was centralized or focused in
Colonel Pash and Antle Lazarus.
Mr. Baron. Now what would have been the formal title
of the unit that Colonel Pash and Artie Lazarus were running?
Mr. Hunt. If it had one, I never knew it.
Mr. Baron. Can you add any other detail to the record
on your talk with Colonel Pash and his reaction to your
request that he consider on a general level the planning of
an assassination of a suspected double agent?
Mr. Hunt. Well, as I recall it, my conversation with him
was a relatively brief one. I stepped in the door, met him,
saw Artie Lazarus, who I knew briefly, or at least knew him
by sight, and I sat down and I said, we have this problem in
the Albanian branch. We may need somebody liquidated in
Western Germany. Can you handle it if that day comes, or if
it comes to that?

And he seemed a little startled. I have already indicated
that. What I'm trying to do now is to refine my thoughts more
than I did previously when we were taking sort of a wide
swipe at the canvas.
Colonel Pash indicated or said to me that it was a matter
5
6
that would have to be approved by higher authority and as
WARD & PAUL

a relatively low ranking officer in those days, I thought he
was probably referring to Frank Wisner. And indeed, he may

there
It never got pushed up to Frank Wisner's level because
no direct approach or a request for such approval
was ever made.
I left with the impression that Colonel Pash was glad
that he wasn't going to have any business for me or that he
had successfully deflected whatever approach I might be making
to him because it would give him and Artie Lazarus an
opportunity to drink more coffee and to draw their salaries
from the Agency while affecting to do a job that they were
perhaps not equipped to do.

Now again, that impression I had when I left him was at
variance with what I had heard before I came in, where I heard

in wet affairs, particularly kidnappings and that sort of
thing.
Mr. Baron. And you carried into his office the impression

Mr. Baron. Did you ever discuss this matter with anyone
other than Colonel Pash?
Mr. Hunt. In that context?
Mr. Baron.
Mr. Hunt.
In the context of assassinations or kidnapping.
Well, I wasn't involved in plotting or planning
any kidnappings. Again, I would suggest that I might very
well have gone back to Blaufarb, who was the most interested
individual, because he was responsible at the branch level
for King Zog as an operational tool, whereas, I had an overall
political responsibility for King Zog And I have described
the background of that, the rubric under which I became
interested in the Albanian problem in the first place, and
then having talked to Pash, it would have been only natural
for me to have said to Blanfarb, look, I've talked with Pash
and he says it will have to be approved by higher authority.

de Lazarus ever mention it to you again?

mine.

Colonel Bash is not dead.

Mr. Baron. Is it possible that your conversation with
Boris Pash about the assassination of a suspected double agent
took place in that time period?
Mr. Hunt. I would have to say it's possible, yes.
Mr. Baron. Would you have been dealing with East
European problems or
Mr. Hunt. No, I was dealing with West European problems.
Mr. Baron. I'm sorry. Would you have been dealing with
a problem like this one, a problem with a suspected Albanian
double agent in West Germany during that time period?
Mr. Hunt. I can't recall having done so. The West
European Division had its own PP staff officer and he would
have been the one to take it up, whereas my recollection is
that this was generated at a later time when I was in the
Southeast European Division and had a direct reason to become
interested in the matter.
I have to say that it is possible, but I would say maybe
5 percent possible.

Now whether Frank would have been required to go to
Allen Dulles, I rather doubt it. I think it is something that
he would have been able to authorize himself.
Mr. Baron. All right. Let me ask you now before we get
into Colonel Pash's version of the story, which we will,
whether it is possible that you are confusing the time periods
here?
So as not to hold anything back from you, Colonel Pash
has said that the time period has to be off because he
retired from the Agency, or left the Agency in probably late
'51. It's possible that it went into 1952. But he wasn't

status was that of a military officer who had been detailed
to the Agency from approximately 1948 to '52.
Now does that affect your recollection in any way of the
period '54 to '55 as the period when your conversation with
Boris Pash took place?
Mr. Hunt. Well, from 1950 to 1953, I was in Mexico as
Chief of the OFC station
Mr. Baron. And where were you from the time that you
joined the Agency until you went to Mexico?

Pash's activities in the years 1949 to 1952?
Mr. Hunt. Not at all, no. My only other collateral
recollection is that Colonel Pash was said to have come to us.
He was recently assigned in Germany and he had come to us
from there. That was all that I knew.
Mr. Baron.
Artie Lazarus, who has also testified this
past week on this subject, said that his recollection of the
charter of PB7 was that it gave PB7 responsibility for
assassinations, kidnappings and such other functions as higher
authority may assign or as were not being performed by other
units.
Does that square with the impression that you were given
by your superiors of the functions of Colonel Pash's unit?
Mr. Hunt. Yes. I didn't even know that Artie was
still alive. So Artie then supports my functional recollection,

Mr. Hunt. Not as such, no. Does Colonel Pash define

what his functions were in the PB7?
here.
Mr. Baron. Before I answer that one, let me ask you one.
Mr. Hunt. I've been trying to develop a helpful colloquy
Mr. Baron. This is very helpful.
Do you recall any charters that any of those planning
branches had?
Mr. Hunt. At this juncture, no. I was only aware that,
I think mine was PB2. This is when I first went in in 1949
or 1950. I think that was Joe Bryan's outfit.
Mr. Baron. Colonel Pash described the charter of PB7
as giving PB7 responsibility for such other functions as the
six other units didn't perform.
Does that square with your recollection of what he was
doing in those early days?
Mr. Hunt. Well, you see, I don't associate Colonel Pash
with the very early days. I associate him with a later period,
about three years or five years later.

Mr. Baron. Did you travel to West Germany during that

of the man except in that particular context.

Mr. Hunt. Is it possible?
Yes, I believe it's possible
because Antiė Lazarus was one of the original people in OPC.
Mr. Baron. At what point did OPC merge or was it
transformed?
Mr. Hunt. Well, it merged with Oso, I think, in 1953
when I was Chief of the OFC station in Mexico and I became
the Deputy Chief of the merged station in Mexico in '53, and
I came out of there in, I think, March of 154, I left Mexico.
By that time the merger had taken place.
Mr. Baron. So is it possible that this chart could have
been a chart of the PP staff as it operated under the OPC
structure, the 453?
Mr. Hunt. Yes. In fact, I don't think that there was
any particular change from the PB to the PP era.
Mr. Baron. The reason for my own confusion here is that
Colonel Pash and Antie Lazarns have both said that at the
point when OPC was merged, or at some point shortly thereafter,
PB7 was abolished and they don't know what became of it.
They say the functions that these seven planning branches
performed were scrambled and reorganized and they were never
sure exactly who carried through the functions that had

had this conversation?
Mr. Hunt. I do, because to the best of my knowledge and
belief, it was the first time that I had met Artie Lazarus
That is, I had seen him in the corridors, but it was the
first time that I was able to append a name to the particular
6 individual who I had come to recognize visually.
7
00
My memory is further jogged in this respect, that hazarus
having identified me as a member of the SE division of the

10 the possibility of his being assigned to the SE division.

And my recollection of the conversation is that Artie told

benefit, and it could be best done by his being transferred
to SE division for ultimate assignment to Athens.

or the other except that in his recent book I read about his
involvement in the Manhattan Project and I certainly admired
his contribution to national security in that era.

Mr. Baron. It appears to me that the Bandoeng Conference
took place, according to Artie Lazarus's testimony, in 1955
and that the incident he was describing was either in '55 or
late in 154.
Mr. Hunt. I had no recollection of it whatever. Arties
is not suggesting that is some basis for personal animosity,
I trust.
Mr. Baron. No. He did say, though, that you might have

assassinations at high levels of the American governemnt?

made my trip to Havana the summer of 1960, and then we had
the Bay of Pigs invasion the following April, of '61.

communications were handled independently between myself and
Tom Karramessines, who was then Deputy Director for Plans.
This was a project that had been laid on by Dick Helms.
I had no station contact at all and I had no responsibilities
to the station, and I had no Cuban activities of any kind.
And did you have any knowledge of a relationship,
to a plan to assassinate Castro, supposedly to take place

I was assigned for about a period of a week to the CA staff

I was the first Chief of Covert Action for the Domestic

of projects that had been running for a period of time, that
had been run by the commercial staff of the Agency and by a
number of the geographic divisions.
The purpose of turning these ongoing projects over to the
Domestic Operations Division was to centralize contacts with
publishers in the United States for the benefit of geographic
divisions such as the Asian or Far East Division which might
want a book published on Indonesia for a particular purpose.
They would come to Tracy Barnes with a particular request.
And I should say that the relationship with the Frederick
A. Praeger Publishing Company had been in existence for quite
a period of time and I think they were managed by Cord Myer

attached an extra paragraph to this cable which suggested the

spokesman on behalf of many Asian nations.
And the way that Antle Lazarus, recounted the incident,
he knew nothing about the paragraph that had been attached to
his cable until the reply came back very strongly in the
negative and eventually, a high ranking CIA official came out
to Taipei to reprimand everyone involved in the incident for
suggesting assassination.

I don't recall any Agency-created manuscripts that were

I recall we had a lot of accounting problems with Praeger
and finally we got really almost bogged down in arguments
about back copies. It was a little on the nightmarish side.
We did turn out some good books, but I couldn't give you a
title at this point. But I'm sure that they are a matter of
record within the Agency.
Mr. Baron. What was the nightmarish aspect of it?
24
25
Mr. Hunt. Well, apparently, before the project came under
DOD, it had been handled on a very freewheeling basis by the
previous project managers. Praeger got everything he wanted
from the Agency in terms of subsidy money and expense money
and publicity money and that sort of thing and when we took

professional management, but I do so in a qualified sense in
that I was the only one, I guess, who knew anything about the
publishing industry, who had ever been connected with the
project. So I knew a little about it.
And at that time, with the help of our own commercial
people within the Division, our accountants and auditors and
so forth determined that there were a number of aspects of
our fiduciary relationship with the Praeger company that would
bear greater investigation.
So the relationship from a freewheeling one prior to our
DOD managerial take-over, it became from a freewheeling thing,

I was told that somewhere within the overall political
and psychological staff there was located a man with a small
office.
This man's name was Pash, Colonel Boris Pash, and
my understanding was that Colonel Pash had been doing business,
let us say, with the Agency in West Germany for quite a while.
I sought out Colonel Pash. I was directed to his office
and found sitting with him another Agency officer named Artie
Lazarus I'm not sure whether it is Arthur Lazarus.

This had been alleged to me. So I spoke to Colonel Pash

identified the Albanian suspect. So we were talking hypothetically

Mr. Hunt. Because the international operations or Inter-

to go into this, although I have discussed it with John
Crowdson. But this is another one of those difficult areas
where it's very hard for me to prove.
There came a time in the spring of, I think it was the
spring of about 1969, when the Soviet Russia Division asked

And so I went to Helms. Howard Osborne was then Chief

It was just information which was supplied which he wrote

to supply either prefabricated articles or the material for
articles to favorable press contacts in this country?
Mr. Hunt. Well, we know about the Reader's Digest book,

and that was done by the SR Division.
You are aware of that, aren't you?
Now in that case, you see, the SR reached out on its own.

with that in DOD. That was done, again, by SR division.

I would be very surprised if a memorandum showed up saying
that we were dealing with Random House, for example. I just
don't recall now.
Mr. Baron. Was there any other aspect to your liaison
with these publishing houses other than their seeking funds
to publish books that you were interested in having published?
Mr. Hunt. Only this, that the USIA was, I think, finally
brought into a formal relationship with DOD, at least my
part of it, and the head of the book division at USIA and I
would meet from time to time and he would indicate that he had
a good one that we really ought to do rather than USIA and
vice versa. And he knew fully of the Praeger relationship.
Mr. Baron. Can you describe the process that you would
go through to ensure the publication of a book that the CIA
was interested in having published? An example that I was
given by somebody on our staff who has been looking into this
was books written by or ghosted for Chinese defectors.

Mr. Hunt. It was impossible because Praeger was a

be reviewed, had to be bought here, had to be read. Again I
say it was a matter of great difficulty.
Mr. Barnes resolved
all that philosophically, and I simply carried out the dicta.
Mr. Baron. What was your philosophical opinion of the
danger of propagandizing Americans?
Mr. Hunt. Well, I knew that it was not a part of the
Agency charter, and it was a matter that the USIA looked at.
The USIA coincidentally had

reasons. I was never enchanted with the Praeger operation. I
thought it cost far too much money and had minimal benefits
abroad, and further, we had the liability, the vulnerability
to quite reasonable critcism that we had U.S. citizens as a

earlier, that when I first inquired around for the location of
Colonel Pash and his assistant, the reaction I encountered
was a rather jesting one, and the impression I gained was
here were a couple of men who were drawing salaries and doing
very little.
And so when Colonel Pash seemed reluctant to become
involved in responding affirmatively to my questions, my
inference was that Colonel Pash and Lazarus could well not
have such a capability but for purposes of employment and
status, this was the job they had. But they didn't want
anyone to call upon them to activate their particular
abilities,

Mr. Baron. Were any techniques used to prevent contamina-

CIA was actually publishing or arranging to have published?
Mr. Hunt. I would assume so, and I would guess that that
would be done in the first instance by the knowledgeability of
the reports officers in the various geographic divisions at
headquarters who would scan newspapers, for example, or they
would receive raw reports from India, let's say, and see that
there had been a big sale of a particular book which we had
sponsored, which they knew we had sponsored but nobody else
knew. Of course, the station in New Delhi would have known about

If your targets are foreign, then where are they? They
don't all necessarily read English, and we had a bilateral
agreement with the British that we wouldn't propagandize thei
people. So unless the book goes into a lot of languages or it is
published in India, for example, where English is a lingua franca,
6
then you have some basic problems. And I think the way this
7
00
10
was rationalized by the project review board that looked over
the Praeger operation, and the Fodor thing, and Continental
9 Press and things like that was that the ultimate target was
formed, which was true, but how much of the Praeger output
actually got abroad for any impact I think is highly arguable.

Now, in the case of Contnental Press the material was
physically mailed from Washington to foreign targets, the
Turkish newspapers, I think particularly the Mideast News
Agency was a client, The mere fact that the project was
rooted in the United States gave it sort of a credibility
lustre abroad in that particular era. If it came out of
Washington then it was probably okay.
But I Continental Press had no domestic U.S. papers
as clients. What I'm trying to get at is that DOD handled
operations which were based domestically in the United States,
the commercial operations, and this includes proprietary
airlines and things like that, whose ultimate target was

Aside from dealing through publishing houses

with authors who were non-CIA employees?

the President had given certain
undertakings to Cuban leadership and to our own paramilitary
people, and had failed to carry them out.
However, this fact was successfully disguised for a number
of years, but Dulles and Dick Bissell-paid the price.
In any events, the Bay of Pigs cost Dulles his leadership
of the Agency, and I had the utmost respect for him. I was
associated with him as an assistant for the special Cuban
Bay of Pigs purposes, for a period of several months prior to,
perhaps six months prior to his eventual retirement.
I had had occasional contacts with him as a Chief of
Station and I had seen him in Japan when he came over there
and we had some discussions. Mr. Dulles brought into the
formal Central Intelligence Agency the same feeling of esprit
de corps that we had all enjoyed in the Office of Strategic
Services, and this was largely lost during the McCone director-
ship. And I think we had some admiral after that, Admiral
Radford, possibly. We got under a group of managers, and the
human element that we had enjoyed in OSS was gone with the
passage of Allen Dulles until Dick Helms came back in.
You
see, I'm an unrepentent admirer of Allen Dulles and the way we

STATEMENT BY E. HOWARD HUNT
Exhibit 1
A year ago when Congress established the Church Committee, Senator

on Appeal and readily available to testify concerning CIA involvement in
allegedly illegal activities. Moreover, I viewed testifying before the
opportunity
Committee as a further/to testify under oath concerning my total non
involvement with Messrs Oswald, Bremer and Sirhan, persons with whom my
name has been slanderously and libelously linked in press and electronic
media. Although I had been interviewed previously by the FBI and the Rock-
efeller Commission with regard to these allegations a host of assassination
buffs and media advocates continued irresponsibly to associate me with the
deaths of the Kennedy brothers and the crippling of Governor Wallace.
My Appeal denied, I re-entered prison in April, 1975. Three weeks
later US Marshals escorted me to Washington DC for what turned out to be a
three-hour interview with a new Watergate Assistant Special Prosecutor. For
a 9-day period I was lodged at the Leesburg, Va., jail, and finally returned
via Detroit and Tallahassee where I was imprisoned in the isolation area
before being driven on May 26 to Eglin Federal Prison Camp. On May 27,
Assistant Committee Counsel Michael Madigan telephoned me to say that the
Church Committee wanted to interview me "within the next two weeks". I
apprised Mr. Madigan of Public Law 93-209, Title 18. Sec.4082(c) Para. 1
(amended) which authorises minimum security prisoners such as myself to be
furloughed for up to 30 days for purposes of testifying. Counsel Madigan
agreed to my testifying on this furlough basis.
Over the summer, however, I heard nothing further from Mr. Madigan
or his Committee associates. Then in mid-September a Washington POST story
alleged that I had been assigned by a White House superior to assassinate

me in prison. He asked if I knew anything about "CIA assassination capa-
bilities", and I related to him my encounter with Col. Boris T. Pash.
Crewdson then inquired whether the Church Committee had interviewed me.
I responded in terms of the foregoing, noting that I would have testified
about the Pash encounter had I been given the publicized opportunities.
My interview with Mr. Crewdson was published and shortly thereafter my
attorney was contacted by a representative of the Committee.
I consider it highly discriminatory that the Committee is
unwilling to have me testify in Washington as a furloughed witness.
Further, the Committee's refusal to postpone interviewing me in prison
until one of two counsel familiar with my career and affairs is available
places me in a difficult position with regard to representation by informed
legal counsel. And, as during the Ervin Committee hearings ( whose cost in
legal fees to me approached $100,000) I must again pay legal fees occasioned
by the interest of the Senate in a matter of no discernible benefit to me
Between last January and April I could freely have traveled to
Washington to testify at the pleasure of the Senate. From then on I could
have been furloughed for that purpose and testified accompanied by customary
counsel who are not now available to me. Nevertheless, in demonstration of
my willingness to cooperate fully with the Senate I agree to be interviewed
under oath today.

Mr. Hunt. I am not.
Mr. Baron. Does your answer include not only the period
of time before you talked with Colonel Pash but after you
talked with Colonel Pash?
Mr. Hunt. Yes, sir.
I might add that I was rather briefly at CIA headquarters
at that time and within a very short period of time after I
had had my interview with Colonel Pash, I was transferred to the
Guatemala project, the overthrow of Guatemala.
Mr. Baron. Is that the reason why you did not follow up
on the problem with this particular suspected double agent
after not receiving satisfaction from Colonel Pash?
Mr. Hunt. That certainly could have been one reason.

Mr. Baron. But that would be the person primarily
responsible for taking care of this double agent problem?
Mr. Hunt. That's correct.
Mr. Baron. Are you aware of what happened with that
suspected double agent?
Mr. Hunt. I have no idea because, as I may have indicated
previously off the record, it became apparent some years later
that the unfortunate fate of our Albanian agents was linked
10

far more closely to the revelations of Kim Philby, the
Soviet agent who was in direct liaison with us in Washington
and in Great Britain, rather than any penetration, although
the possibility of a penetration was of course always there.

I had a client-King to worry about. And also, we were trying
to bring Zog into this country. So I became interested as

And that was my introduction to the whole
scene in West Germany, where the balance of his retainers were
being held by the CIA. Well, not being held, but where they
were being housed and trained for Albanian operations.
Mr. Baron. Can you explain the term "retainer"?
Mr. Hunt. Well, I understood that when he finally got
out of Albania, that he brought with him what I can best
describe as retainers. That is bodyguards, members of his
personal staff, probably some relatives. I think he had
four or five sisters with him. But the able-bodied portion
of those loyalists who came out with him we had largely taken
over thanks to Zog, who, in effect, ordered then to cooperate
with us. And then he never saw them again. He naturally
became apprehensive.
So that was my interest in what was happening to the
Albanians that we parachuted in through King Zog,
