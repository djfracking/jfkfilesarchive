would not be thought of at age 43.
A retirement progman could provide for partiei-
pation by the individual and also take into consideration
what the individual would receive from his country'G
Social Security progran. This type of plan would give
the individual a vested interest as well as a iccling
of security in terms of the future.

MICROFILES
1. In preparing a recent request for an amendment to Raymond
H. GERENDE's contract, it occurred to us that it would probably be
useful to bring Headquarters up-to-date on GERENDE's cover status.
As a full-time contract agent, GERENDE is on call at all times for
operational activity. His cover activity not only provides him with
the necessary flexibility, it is also solid enough to provide him
with a plausible explanation of his existence and his income.
"
"
OSRAM
2. GERENDE has two major cover activities. One is the teaching
of English, mainly to middle-management personnel of American-owned
firms in Mexico City. This is done on a
This is done on a regular basis for a few
-hours each day and earns GERENDE an income of about 5000 pesos per
month. His second cover activity, and one which is largely a cover
and not really activity, is working as a salesman for IDEN A. GERENDE
actually earns only about 500 pesos per month from this, but this lact
is a closely guarded secret. GERENDE's acquaintances assume that a
good part of his income comes from this cover. Previously, GERENDE
had been able to "prove" a total income of about 8000 pesos per month,
ostensibly from IDEN B. IDEN B was owned by LISTERINE, and for years
he had carried GERENDE on his payroll as an independent salesman on
commission. He would ostensibly pay GERENDE a certain amount of
money, and IDEN B's accountant would duly file income tax returns and
social security based on this alleged payment. IDEN B would also
pay whatever taxes were called for by the statements filed.

system of "ghost payrolling" is quite common in Mexico, as everybody
gains: the company because its declared profit is lower than it
really is and, therefore, subject to less tax, and the individual
because he is ordinarily given a kickback for allowing his name to
be used (or in GERENDE's case, because it provided cover).
I
3. All this ended on 31 December 1967, when LISTERINE sold
IDEN B to IDEN A. For a while thereafter, GERENDE paid taxes only
on the money he actually earned with IDEN A, which was, as stated,
about 500 pesos per month. As of 1 July 1968, however, LISTERINE
arranged, at GERENDE's request, to have his accountant (who continued
to handle GERENDE's taxes as a favor to LISTERINE) to lump together
all of GERENDE's earnings (from teaching as well as IDEN A) as
"professional earnings" and to file returns for GERENDE which included
the total amount. This is not quite as satisfactory as the old
arrangement (among other things GERENDE must now pay his own taxes)
but for cover purposes it is entirely adequate. Other than LISTERINE
and the accountant, no one knows that GERENDE's ostensible earnings
have dropped, and, as far as we know, LISTERINE is the only person
who is aware of GERENDE's tie with WOFIRM.

1. The Station has finally compiled the information necessary
to answer the questions raised in Ref B and, in doing so, wishes to
repeat the request originally made in Ref A to amend Raymond H.
GERENDE's contract to provide him with a certain amount of job security
2. First, Ref B raised the point that there had been no efficiency
reports written on GERENDE or "evidence of outstanding performance."
GERENDE's performance has been evaluated regularly within the context
of the regular LIEMPTY Project progress reports, and a review of the
past several reports will demonstrate that the Station has been more
than satisfied with GERENDE's performance and is anxious to take
advantage of his full potential. The Station does not believe,.
however, that "evidence of outstanding performance" should be a
prerequisite for the type of contract amandment being requested. It
is perfectly true, as pointed out in Ref B, that the Station had gone
on record in 1959 that GERENDE should not be paid a termination
bonus if he should resign simply to get the extra money or to pursue
another career. By now, however, GERENDE has cast his lot with
WOFIRM. He really
He really has no other career, and to try to start one at
this point would be extremely difficult. On the other hand, if he

undoubtedly wish to reward his long years of loyal service with a
generous termination payment. He has earned it, and only termination
for cause per paragraph 10 (b) of his contract would prevent him
from receiving it.
3. Mexican law (it is the law, not custom) says that an employee
who is fired must be paid three months' salary plus twenty days'
salary for each full year employed by the company at the pay rate
existing at the time of separation. GERENDE's current cover company
adheres to this formula. Since GERENDE's termination clause has
always read that he would be paid a full month's salary for every
year of service (in the event of his termination by WOFIRM), we would
not want to change that, and in fact we wish to add to it the three
months' pay guaranteed by Mexican law. At the same time, we do see
some virtue in the suggestion in paragraph 3 of Ref B that full
retirement benefits (in the event of GERENDE's resignation) would
apply only aïter 20 years' service, with lesser benefits until then.
Our suggestion would be that in the event of his resignation prior to
15 full years of service (i.e. prior to 18 March 1970) he be paid
twenty days' salary for each full year, that after 15 years but prior
to 20 he be paid this amount plus three full months' salary, and that
after 20 years he be paid three months' salary plus one months' salary
for every full year. It is
It is true, of course, that Mexican law does
not make any provision for payment of a termination bonus to an
employee who resigns, but most enlightened companies have some sort
of retirement program, and, as Ref B correctly points out, "working
for WOFIRM is a very special case and deserves exceptional financial
consideration." In the case of GERENDE, we are not attempting to
establish any pattern. This is a special case (as are most) and the
Station merely wishes to insure that GERENDE, who has made WOFIRM a
career without receiving any career benefits in return, is rewarded.
for his loyalty and is given some incentive for the future. GERENDE
is not without his faults, and he is being adequately compensated for
the work he performs, but we cannot expect to get more out of him
without showing him greater respect.
4. The Station requests, therefore, that the following amendment
be made in paragraph 11 of GERENDE's contract:
a. In the event of GERENDE's termination by WOFIRM, he will
receive three months' pay plus one month's pay for every full
year of service since 18 March 1955, calculated at the rate
applicable at the time of termination.
:
b.. GERENDE's resignation upon 60 days' notice will be
accepted by WOFIRM as being in its best interest, and GERENDE
will be eligible for terminal payment according to the following
formula: Prior to 18 March 1970, GERENDE will receive 20 days'
pay for every full year of service since 18 March 1955; after 18
March 1970 but prior to 18 March 1975, GERENDE will receive
three months' pay plus 20 days for every full year since 18
March 1955; after 18 March 1976 GERENDE will receive three months
pay plus one month for every full year of service since 18 March
1955. All payments are to be calculated at the rate applicable
at the time of resignation.
5. Paragraph 10 (b) will, of course, remain in force.
6.
Ref D asked that GERENDE's contract be extended for another
year without change. We assume that this has been done, although we
have not been notified.

SUMMARY
.
UNIA-35030, 22 July 1968
1. There have been no basic changes in the operation of the
project during the reporting period. Raymond H. GERDE continues
as principal agent, handling the personnel of the two base houses,
LILYRIC and LICALLA, and performing other additional tasks. On
27 December 1968, consistent with our effort to get as much of the
support activity as possible handled by outside officers, direct
agent-handling responsibility for GERENDE and the LIENTTY project
was turned over to Bruce H. FERNALD, Vincent P. RIZZUTO remains
as alternate and as FERNALD's inside contact.
GERINDE
2. Until the introduction of FERNALD, there was no change in
the meeting arrangements with GERENDE. Meetings were held on an
average of three times per week until October, when LIEMPTY-19
(GERENDE's wife) was relieved of the responsibility of transcribing
the Spanish-language portions of LIEVOY coverage of the BEDOX
installation. Thereafter meetings averaged twice per week, the main
business being the transfer of LIEMPTY base house material and
discussion of base house business.

3. GERRIDE's agent handling responsibilities within the LEPTY
project remain as previously reported. He had also handled
TN-3
until the latter's termination in August 1968. He developed a good
relationship with EPPAH-3, and he showed that he is quite capable,
with proper case officer guidance, of providing useful service to
the Station in the handling of agents beyond the support type to
which he had been limited in the past. The Station intends to try
to expand this role, with due regard for security and for GERENDA's
limited experience. Furthermore, the Station still has every
intention of using GERANDE selectively in cultivation and development
of operational leads, as outlined in reference. No such leads vere
found for GERENDE during the reporting period (among other reasons,
we have no intention of giving GRANDE a lead simply for the sake of
giving him something to do), but as soon as a suitable lead is
uncovered, it will be passed to GRANDE.
G. GERENDE was particularly useful during the Olympic period.
While he did not get a job with the Clympic Committed as he had
hoped, his wife was employed as a translator by the European television
networks who had come to cover the ganes. This, plus other personal
contacts, gave GERENDE a certain amount of access to Olympic facilities
Both GERMIDE and his wife helped considerably in the distribution of
AEEGGIDAD material, and GERINDE performed a number of miscellaneous
tasks assisting the Station in various Olympic responsibilities.
5. GEREDE has also been used in support of JMROD operations,
such as making mail pick-ups and delivering material and making phone
calls to AMBASSOON. Following the Warsaw Pact Powers' invasion of
Czechoslovakia, GERENDE was asked to cover a demonstration in front
of the Soviet Embassy, and he wrote a good report which was used in
Babassy briefings. Recently, GERINDE has enrolled at the
University of the Americas to work for an M.A. in contemporary
Mexican history. The Station will explore the possibility of his
getting access to persons or information of interest on the University
campus.
LICALIA
6. LIEMPTY-9's work (in the LICALLA base house) was inhibited
in July due to the construction of a maid's room near his working
quarters. During the reporting period, however, he took a total of
2,217 operational photos. His regular reporting and commentary
continued as in the past. LIEMPTY-9 is a steady and dependable per-
former, and his unique vantage point remains the source of the most
interesting and revealing photos as well as often very informative
reporting.
LILYRIC
7. LIEMPTY-13, -14, -26, and -27 have been able to keep the
LILYRIC base house manned on a regular basis from 0800 to 1800 hours
weekdays and 0800 to 1500 hours on Saturdays, with other hours cover-
able upon request. This has proven to be a far better arrangement
than depending on LIMITED for some of this coverage. In addition to
the 6,763 operational photos taken during the reporting period and the
daily fixed surveillance reports, LILYRIC reporting is of considerable
help in compiling current vehicle and license plates lists, PCS arrivals
and departures, unusual activities such as demonstrations or protests,
unusual or lengthy absences of personnel, etc., all of which have
obvious Cl importance. It was LILYRIC photos which made it possible
for LNERGO to identify the Subject of 201-841520, who had been in
clandestine contact with AEGRIP officers. LILYRIC also reported on
a half dozen other American (or American appearing) visitors, some of
whom it was possible to identify through tracing license plates.

of management, and we have been waiting for GERENDE to provide
us with a written statement of his current cover status, as well
as a statement of the retirement rights and benefits provided
legitimate employees of the cover company. Our intention is to
have GEREKDE's contract provide, in so far as possible, termi-
nation benefits equivalent to those granted by his cover -
company to a normal employeo. As soon as this information is
available, a comprehensive reply to FDR-5971 will be pouched.

Summary
aimed
1. During the reporting period, the project's principal
agent, Raymond H. GERENDE, was assigned additional tasks,
at broadening his usefulness to the Station. These tasks
included spotting and assessment as well as the handling of a
recruited agent, ERFAIN-3.* GERENDE did well, and it is believed
that a new dimension has been opened for him, and by the same.
The
token, the Station has, in effect, gained a new asset.
LIEMPTY base houses continued to produce at their usual rate
and with their usual effective support to Station REDTOP oper-
ations. The LIMITED Base House and its operator, LIEMPTY-6,
were terminated on 31 May 1968. Termination was decided upon
partly to save money and partly because advancing age had measur-
ably decreased the reliability and effectiveness of LIEMPTY-6's.
work. LIEMPTY-26 was rehired, which permitted the LILYRIC. Base
House to give us the same total hours of coverage as LILYRIC
and LIMITED had together in the past..

6. In line with the above reasoning, GERENDE was introduced
to Andrew R. DOSCHER on 17 February 1968. The idea was that
GERENDE would be trained to assist DOSCHER in some of his
operations against Central American targets. GERENDE's principal
duty thus far has been to take over the handling of ERFAIN-3,
under DOSCHER's close supervision and guidance. GERENDE has
performed quite creditably in this task. He seems interested
in the work and has learned quickly. On the other hand, an
apparently ingrained habit of procrastination has resulted in
dilatory reporting. If GERENDE can overcome this (and both case
officers are working hard to teach GERENDE the importance of
prompt and complete reporting) there seems to be every reason
to believe GERENDE will develop into a competent agent handler.
-
-
7. GERENDE was also given the task of locating and developing
(in alias) a girl who, per LIENVOY, was being cultivated by
AERODENT. Although GERENDE had to be continually reminded of the
assignment, he did an excellent job of meeting the girl and
gaining her confidence. It is quite likely that he could have
recruited the girl as an access agent against AERODENT, but as
this point was reached another operation against AERODENT was
launched and it was not felt that attempting to recruit the girl
would serve any useful purpose, for the time being at least
(among other things, there was no indication that she had had
any contact with AERODENT for some months). The only flaw in
GERENDE's performance was the time it took him to get around to
doing the job. It should be mentioned, however, that at the
same time GERENDE had a number of pressing personal matters to
attend to, including overseeing the completion of his new house,
which he finally moved into on 10 March 1968, even though
construction is still not entirely completed.
8. Among other assignments completed by GERENDE in the
reporting period were the renting of an apartment for use as a
listening post; and initiating a relationship with a Russian
translator working for the NHRAVEL committee.

2. During the reporting period, the case officer has been
meeting GERENDE an average of three times per week. Meetings
are usually pre-arranged, at various sites and times. Meetings
average 20 to 30 minutes. GERENDE turns over to the case
officer negatives, prints, logs, and other reports which he has
picked up from the base houses since the previous meeting,
along with brief contact reports on his meetings with base
house representatives. Reports on other operational activities
are also turned in and discussed, and GERENDE is given instruc-
tions, notes for the base houses, and negatives for any enlarge-
ments which may be desired by the Station.
by the Station. Also, LIENVOY tapes
and transcripts are exchanged at each meeting. (The departure
of LIACUTE-1 at the end of April 1968 left the Station without a
BEDOX transcriber. As a temporary solution, pending the return
of LIACUTE-1 or the recruitment of another BEDOX transcriber,
GERENDE's wife, LIEMPTY-19, has been hired at the rate of 31.50
pesos per hour to transcribe the Spanish language portions of the
tapes. She does the work in her home, and GERENDE transports the
tapes.)
--
3. GERENDE has the direct agent-handling responsibility for
the following LIEMPTY agents: LIEMPTY-4 (photo-processor; met
twice per week); LIEMPTY-G (LIMITED; met once per week until
termination); LIEMPTYS 13, 14, 26, and 27 (LILYRIC; LIEMPTY-13
normally met twice per week in his absence LIEMPTY-27 makes
meetings); and LIEMPTY-9 (LICALLA; met twice per week). He is
responsible for directing their work, paying them, and handling
all or the administrative problems which may develop. To judge
from the results, GERENDE has excellent rapport with these agents.
and is able to get a consistently high performance rate from
them particularly LICALLA and LILYRIC personnel.
:
4. As noted in reference, GERENDE was employed by the
Mexican MHRAVEL committee, which we found a useful side benefit.
His &HRAVEL activity during the reporting period has been minimal,
but we expect it to start picking up again. GERENDE has con-
ducted a few discreet inquiries and investigations for us within
the MHRAVEL complex, and we have instructed him to try to get
an assignment which will keep him as close to the FJSTEAL
delegation as possible.
.
•
5. Reference also pointed out that GERENDE had performed
nicely in the cultivation and development of an operational
lead, and that the Station planned to give GERENDE more of the
same. Furthermore, GERENDE's standing assignments (LIEMPTY
base houses, MHRAVEL activity, and occasional support of JAROD
requirements) were not challenging enough or occupying enough
of GERENDE's time. GERENDE is rather firmly committed to
WOFIRM by virtue of the fact that he has worked for WOFIRM for
over 13 years and has no other outside employment of any.
consequence. By the same token, he was, through no fault of
his own, doing less work for WOFIRM than at any time in his
career. GERENDE's operational exposure through the years
dictated more and more restrictions on his activity, for sound
security reasons. The solution to GERENDE's problem (lack of
a promising future) and the Station's (not getting its money's
worth) seemed to be to give GERENDE additional tasks which he
could handle under suitable cover and with due regard to security
precautions. Since most of GERENDS's support activities had
been against the FJSTEAL target, particular care would have to
be taken in committing him further in this direction. It was
decided, therefore, that his principal retooling would be in
a non-FJSTEAL field.

1. Before amending GERENDE's contract in accordance with
reference, we would like to clarify a few points about GERENDE
and about terminations and resignations in general.
2. We assume from the files that GERENDE's performance has
been entirely satisfactory but since there are no efficiency re-
ports or actual evidence of outstanding performance, we would
like to have a statement from the station which would justify the
requested amendment. Nine years ago the station said, in A.
13571 that "station would not want to give GERENDE a terminal
payment if he elects to resign just to receive some extra money
or to pursue sose other career." That was a long time ago, how-
ever, and thirteen years of loyal collaboration may very well
have changed your mind on this point.
3. Reference says that GERENDE has no intention of resigning,
and we hope this is true if you feel that he is still as valuable
as he ever was. Assuming, however, for a moment that he might
have in the back of his mind the idea of leaving in a few months
to take a more secure and productive job while the taking is good
do you feel that if he quits at his own convenience he is entitled
to the same benefits that would normally accrue to him if he had
worked longer and was released at our convenience? Assuming that
he were to quit next week, sould you still want to pay him the
proposed termination bonus? Or would you want to include in the

As reported in reference, (HMMA 32721, 7 Aug 67) GERENDE had been
developing a possible access agent to LIRING This eventually culminated in
An attempted recruitment of the prospect by GERENDE. Although the attempt
was unsuccessful, GERENDE exhibited considerable resourcefulness and operational
skill in developing the target to a point where the recruitment attempt was
possible. We plan to use CERENDE in similar roles in the future as opportunities
arise, and for this reason we plan to document him with a set of false Mexican
documentation. GERENDE is collecting exemplars and getting the background
information needed and once the necessary data are assembled, headquarters
(WOACRE) support will be requested.

contract the proviso that full retirement benefits (three months
salary plus one month's salary for each year worked) should apply
after, say, twenty year's service, with lesser benefits to apply
between now and then?
'
4. Could you recapitulate for us the prevailing Mexican law
or custom (which is it?) on termination-at-the-convenience-of-the-
employer? A number of months ago you told us that it was three
months pay plus 20-days-per-year-worked, but the LIFIRE/4 and 5
MOC's said that "following local custom of termination subject only
has to be paid one month's salary for each year of employment”.
Your proposed GERENDE terminal payment formula, (which may be a
special case rather than a pattern and which, as we understand it,
makes no distinction between voluntary resignation and termination-
at-the-convenience-of-the-employer) is one month's pay for each
full year of employment, plus three months pay at the rate applic-
able at the time of termination. Does this imply that the one
month's pay for each year worked is computed at the rate of pay pre -
vailing during each respective year worked? Does Mexican law or
custom dictate the payment of terminal bonus to employees who resign
voluntarily? (Working for WOFIRM is a very special case, obviously,
and deserves exceptional financial consideration, but we do want to
understand the background as it applies to commercial work so that
we may have a frame of reference or point of departure).
5. We apologize for the long delay in sending this dispatch.
It was originally written in Harch, and mislaid in transit, but we
thought it had been pouched.
6. Apart from the foregoing, do you recommend any changes in
GERENDE's contract which will be due for renewal on 1 October 19687

Acting Chief of Station, Mexico City
Amendment of Raymond H. GERENDE's Contract
ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES
REFERENCE:
ENCE: HAWW-8281, 2 December 1959
MCCROFILM
1.
It is requested that the following amendments be made
to Paragraph 11 "Terminal Payment" of Raymond H. GERENDE'☎
contract (see reference):
&. The amount of terminal payment, in addition to one
month's compensation for each full year of employment since
18 March 1955, should also include three months' pay at the rate
applicable at the time of termination.
b. GERENDE's resignation upon 60 days' notice will be
accepted by the goverment as being in its best interest, and
GERENDE will be eligible for full terminal payment.
2. The revision requested in paragraph 1 a above is for the
purpose of having the contract conform to Rexican law, which
calls for three months' salary plus one month for each year of
service. The second revision is designed to give GERENDE the
option of resigning without jeopardizing his terminal payment.:
He has no intention of resigning, but he feels that the contract,
it stands, leaves him with no security. The terminal payment
is his only retirement program, but as written it does not give
him the option of retiring. The Station advised GERENDE that
any request of his to retire would undoubtedly be accepted as long
as there were no adverse security or operational factors, but
agrees that in fairness to GERENDE, who has, in effect, chosen
career with WOFIRM, the clause should be rewritten to guarantee
him a termination payment. GERENDE understands that paragraph
10 (b) of the contract will remain in force, and if invoked will
deprive him of any terminal payment.

3. All assets involved in the LIEMPTY Project performed in a sat-
isfactory mammar during this period. Effective 1 July 1967 WIENSTYA
and LIEMPTY-11 were given slight salary increases, because of their
increased activity.
4. There were no known security incidents affecting the LIEMPTY
Project or the assets involved during the three months under review.
LICALLA
5. This basshouse, the operator of which is LIEMPTY-9, provided
1277 frames of operational photographs covering the patio and garden arta
of FJSTEAL. LIEMPTY-9 also prepared fixed-surveillance reports, sighting
reperts and special notes and comments.
LILYTIC
6. The LILYRIC basehouse, which is staffed by LIEMPTY-13, -14 and -27,
produced 2854 frames of operational photograph during the period. The
LILYRIC basshouse operators continued to prepare fixed-surveillance reports
each member of PSETEAL and turned these in on a weekly basis. LIEMPTY-27
resummed his duties on 1 July as scheduled and this basehouse has now pÓ-
verted to its normal hours of coverage. (See reference relative to the
absence of LIEGTY-27.)
LIMITED
w
7. The LDUTED Basehouse, operated by LIEPTY-6, produced 279 frames
of operational photographs plus weekly fixed surveillance reports on ench
of the members of FJSTEAL. The LIMITED besehouse was closed from 17 through
22 July because of the illness of LIEMPTY-6. During this period LIEMPTY-6
did very little radio-alerting for the LIEMBRACE surveillance team because
of the variation of the surveillance team's activities.
LIETRAP
8. The LITRAP mobile photo vehicle had a decrease in ectivity during
this period because of the dismantling of the old LIENTRAP vehicle and the
modification and installation of equipment in the new vehicle. The old
LIEMTRAP vehicle was used to cover photographically all of the residences
of opposition elements in Mexico City. As in the past LeSTRAP provided
photographic coverage of addresses of the local Commmist parties, residences
of members of other Hemisphere parties and several PERUMEN targets. A
total of 332 frames of operational photographs were provided by LIENTPAP.
PHOTO LAB
9. LIENITY-4, the operator of the LIEMPTY photo lab, processed áll
of the operational photographs mentioned above as well as providing from
2 to 6 enlargements of 299 frames of photographs of special interest taken
by the basehouses. LIEPTY-4 does the photo processing on Tuesday and
Thursday nights.
10. Raymond H. GEREDE started the development of a possible access
agant to LIRING and also contimed to provide support for the JMROD
operation. These task being aside from his regular LIEMPTY duties.
GERENDE was on vacation from 25 May through 4 June 1967.
11. There will be one administrative change during the coming period
when Vincent P. KIZZUTO will assume the Case officer responsibilities for
GERENDE/LILAÆPTY. No problems are envisioned in this change over. No other
significant changes are planned.

Mr. Maurits Roos
4744 Kenmore Avenue
Alexandria, Virginia
Dear Mr. Roos,
As you may be aware, your sister, Hestor Roos de
Alvarez was associated with this Agency in Mexico City
for a number of years, and due to personal problems with
her husband, her services (and those of her husband)
with this Agency were formally terminated on 26 June
1970. In the termination agreement, this Agency agreed
to pay Mrs. Hestor Roos de Alvarez a bonus payment
amounting to $2500 payable in ten monthly installments
of $250 beginning 31 July 1970. Since Mrs. Roos departed
Mexico City in July 1970 and came to the U.S., she could
not be contacted in Mexico City to receive these pay-
ments. While in the U.S., Hrs. Roos de Alvarez contacted
our Agency on 8 July 1970 and requested we pay her the
funds here; and while her request was being considered
she departed the U.S. for Mexico, and later went to The
Hague where she is residing at Ary Schefferstratt 47,
The Hague, Netherlands. Mrs. Roos de Alvarez has
written to this Agency from the Hague requesting we for-
ward the payments to her via international mail. If you
concur, this Agency would perfer to forward these pay-
ments to you directly, and request that you forward them
to your sister via the international mails. The initial
check for $750 covers payments for the months of July,
August, and September 1970; and hereafter, we will for-
ward to you monthly a check (from October 1970 through.
April 1971) in the amount of $250 in your sister's nane
so that you can forward them on to her every month. We
appreciate your cooperation in this matter and request
that these payments not be discussed with anyone except
your sister, Mrs. Hestor Roos de Alvarez, since the case.
is considered to be a sensitive matter by the United.
States Government.

3. On 8 July 1970 Mrs. Roos de Alvarez appeared at
the main gate of Headquarters building, and subsequently
was interviewed by Mr. Paul Leverone, the Security Duty
Officer; and a statement was taken from her. Hra. Roos
was given an Agency Security office telephone number for
future contact while in the U.S., and on 13 July 1970,
her brother, Mr. Maurits Roos, called the Agency and
informed us that his sister had returned to Mexico and could
be reached there at a certain address, so we are certain
that Mr. Roos is aware of the fact that his sister was
employed at one time by this Agency in Mexico City.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division
Raymond H. GERENDE (P) and Wife.
SUBJECT
1. Raymond H. GERENDE is a Mexican citizen and con-
tract agent who has been employed by the Agency in Mexico
City since 18 March 1955 under an NOC, during which time
he has served this Agency well. During the past fifteen
_years GERENDE has been generally engaged in the area of
operational support activities in Mexico City. For the
past two years he served as a principal agent handler
for a sensitive fixed surveillance project, LIEMPTY; was
used in unilateral recruitment approaches against the
Cubar target; and in special support investigations.
Mrs. GERENDE, who is LIEMPTY/19, has been employed off
and on since 1958 as a support asset, (transcriber/trans-
lator) under MOC, and during the past two years has worked
intermittently transcribing unilateral telephone tap tapes.
2. During the past year GERENDE and his wife have.
had serious marital problems which culminated in a sepa-
ration in November 1969, and divorce actions were initiated
by both parties. The divorce proceedings are still in
the courts, and bitter disputes have resulted between both
parties concerning custody of the children, division of
personal property, and the monetary settlements. The above
problem is compounded by the fact that GERENDB's wife knows
in some considerable detail of GERENDE's activities on
behalf of the Agency and if she exposed him, it could lead
to the surfacing of GERENDE's Agency employment and pos-
sible compromise of operations LIEMPTY, LIMESA, LIEMBRACE,
and LIFEAT, as well as numerous individual Station assets
such as LISTERINE, LIRAZOR/1, LIBAND/1, and David M.
WILSTED (P). Since late 1969, Mexico City Station has
been in touch with both GERENDE and his wife on this prob-
lem, and every effort has been made by the Station to have

both parties settle the divorce amicably and to protect
GERENDE's cover and that of the projects. Because of the
above family problems which threatened GERENDE's personal
cover and security, he was relieved of all operational
responsibilities and placed on half salary in December 1969.
3. In March of 1970, Mexico City Station decided.
that GERENDE's personal problems were not being resolved,
and because of the continuing security threat, plans were
made to terminate both GERENDE and his wife by the end of
PY 1970. The LIEMPTY Project renewal, approved in May
1970, was amended to include a termination bonus for
GERENDE of $10,000 for 15 years of service with the Agency,
and in addition approval was received to pay Mrs. GERENDE
the sum of $2,500 as a security measure designed to keep
her from revealing her husband's Agency affiliation and
what she knows about Agency operations in Mexico. This
project approval carried the ADD caveat that the ter-
mination bonuses to both GERENDE and his wife be paid on
a monthly basis rather than in one lump sum as a security
measure to assure at least an element of control over
both individuals, since the continued receipt of these
monthly payments depended on their loyalty to the Agency.
GERENDE and his wife were terminated by Station represen-
tatives in Mexico on 26 June 1970 under standard Agency
procedures, and separate Quit Claims and Secrecy Agree-
ments were signed by both GERENDE and his wife. Neither
GERENDE nor his wife had any objection to the wording of
the Quit Claims or the Security agreements, and both
appeared to be satisfied with the terms of the settlement,
and with the fairness of the Agency's position.
-
4. On 8 July 1970 at 1115 hours, Mrs. GERENDE appeared
at the main gate of the Headquarter's building, and requested
to see an official from the Office Security. During the
subsequent interview, Mrs. GERENDE established her identity,
and supplied the interviewer with details on her and her
husband's past employment with the Agency in Mexico City
and the fact that they had terminated said employment in
late June 1970. Mrs. GERENDE made three specific requests
of the Agency:

7.
On 14 July ¿¡ú, headquarters. cabled Mexico City
Station advising them of the above development, and
requested they contact Mrs. GERENDE and inform her of the
following Headquarters answers to her requests (as out-
lined in paragraph 4 above):
A. We cannot release her from her from her security
agreement.
B. We cannot consider awarding her additional finan-
cail benefits beyond the amount stated in the termination
agreement, which she accepted.
C. We are willing to forward checks to her by mail,
but request an address other than the Netherlands Embassy.
8. Headquarters has also requested that Mexico City
Station keep Headquarters advised of developments in the
case of Mrs. GERENDE.

"A.
That she be released from the stipulation in
her secrecy agreement which prohibits her from revealing
her or her husband's affiliation with the Agency, in
order that she may substantiate her husband's salary to
be awarded support payment from her husband.
"B.
If her first request cannot be fullfilled,
that she be awarded a higher amount of support from the NCE.
Agency.
"C. If neither of the above two can be fullfilled,
that she be sent the Agency check (in present amount)
either at the address mentioned above or in care of the
Embassy of the Netherlands in Mexico City, which is
accepting mail for her."
In addition to the above, Mrs. GERENDE stated she feels
she must permanently leave Mexico City because of threats
made on her life by her husband, and that she cannot meet
her Agency Econtact in Mexico City as specified in hor
termination, to receive the monthly payments from him.
Mrs. GERENDE has been given the phone number of the agency
Securi Duty Officer and her local phone number and
address, where she is temporarily residing, was obtained.
She was advised she would be contacted within the near
future with an answer to her requests.

5. Upon receipt of the above information, Mexico City
Station was notified by cable of the situation and their.
comments were requested. The Station, on 10 July, recom-
mended that Headquarters hold Mrs. GERENDE to her secrecy
agreement, not grant her any increase beyond the amount
agreed upon in her termination, and proposed that she be
givon her termination payment in one lump sum or that
checks be mailed to her monthly.
6. Headquarters, in agreement with the Station's
position on the case, attempted to telephone her without
success on 13 July 1970. That same afternoon at 1400
hours, Mrs. GERENDE's brother, a naturalized U.S. citizen
who resides in Alexandria, Virginia, and works at Fort
Belvoir, called the Office of Security, using the number
supplied to Mrs. GERENDE, and informed the security
official that since Mrs. GERENDE had not received any
response, she expects to hear from JKLANCE by letter in
care of the Netherlands Embassy, Mexico City.

1. RAYMOND H. GERENDE, (IDENTITY A) WAS RECRUITED IN MARCH 1955
AS A MEMBER OF A STATION UNILATERAL SURVEILLANCE TEAM; GERENDE
RECEIVED AN OPERATIONAL APPROVAL ON 28 FEB 55 AND ON 1 OCT 55 WAS
CONVERTED TO CONTRACT STATUS WITH AN INITIAL ANNUAL SALARY OF 83600,
BY LATE 1956 HE HAD BECOME THE P/A IN CHARGE OF THE SURVEILLANCE TEAM
AND ADDITIONALLY WAS IN CHARGE OF PHOTO SURVEILLANCE OF THE SOVIET
MISSION, INCLUDING PROCESSING THE FILM. AT THIS TIME HE WAS DESCRIBED
AS BEING "CONSCIENTIOUS, LOYAL, HARDWORKING AND DEDICATED." IN 1957
HE WAS GIVEN FIVE WEEKS OF CLANDESTINE OPS TRAINING IN THE HOS-AREA,
BEING DESCRIBED BY HIS TRAINER AS MORE "PRO-AMERICAN THAN MEXICAN,
IN LATE 1958 HE WAS DESCRIBED AS ONE OF THE STATION'S HOST. VALUABLE
ASSETS", ETC.
2. SON 12 DEC 58 GERENDE MARRIED LIEMPTY-19 (IDENTITY B), MMO
ASSISTED HIM DURING THE NEXT TEN YEARS AS A PART-TIME SUPPORT ASSET.
IN GENERAL GERENDE APPEARS TO HAVE PERFORMED A CREDITABLE JOB AS THE
P/A FOR THE KDFACTOR ACTIVITY, WHICH PROVIDED SURVEILLANCE AND PHOTO
COVERAGE OF THE SOVIET TARGET. AT THE TIME OF TERMINATION, HIS
CONTRACT AGENT SALARY HAD INCREASED TO $7000 PER ANNUM. SIGNIFICANTLY
EXCEPT FOR GIVING ENGLISH LESSONS AND OTHER MINOR COVER ACTIVITIES,
GERENDE WAS CONSIDERED TO BE A FULL-TIME RTACTION EMPLOYEE. HE
PERFORMED A NUMBER OF TASKS IN ADDITION TO KDFACTOR, INCLUDING
SERVING AS LP KEEPER AND TRANSCRIBER/TRANSLATOR OF AN AUDIO OPERATION,
INVOLVEMENT IN OPS AGAINST THE CUBAN MISSION AND CUBAN EXILE GROUPS,
GENERAL OPS SUPPORT, AND SPOTTING AND ASSESSMENT. ON 8 OCT 1963,
GERENDE SUCCESSFULLY PASSED AN SGSWIRL, ALTHOUGH IT EMERGED THAT HE
HAD NOT ACCOUNTED FOR ALL FUNDS PASSED TO HIM (THE STATION DISMISSED
THIS PROBLEM) AND FELT THAT HE WAS BEING UNDEREMPLOYED BY RTACTION.
CONCERNING THE LATTER CHARGE, THE STATION SEEMS TO HAVE HAD PROBLEMS
THROUGHOUT THE 1960'S KEEPING GERENDE FULLY OCCUPIED, SINCE FOR.
SECURITY REASONS THERE WAS RELUCTANCE TO INTRODUCE HIM TO ANY MORE
OPERATIONS THAN THE CONSIDERABLE NUMBER HE WAS ALREADY AWARE OF.
(FYI: IN ADDITION TO HIS WIFE, GERENDE'S MOTHER,201-0262488, AND
TWO BROTHER-IN-LAWS (KDFACTOR-1) AND (KDADAGE-14) WERE ALSO STATION
ASSETS.

3. IN 1969 GERENDE SEPARATED FROM LIEMPTY-19 IN WHAT TURNED
OUT TO BE THE BEGINNING OF AN EXTREMELY ACRIMONIOUS DIVORCE PRO-
CEEDING AND FIGHT FOR THE CUSTODY OF THEIR THREE CHILDREN. IN
DECEMBER 1969 GERENDE WAS PUT ON HALF PAY AND HAD HIS OPS DUTIES
SUSPENDED BY THE STATION BECAUSE OF HIS FULL-TIME INVOLVEMENT IN
LEGAL MATTERS SURROUNDING THE DIVORCE. ON 26 JUNE 1970 GERENDE AND
LIEMPTY-19 SIGNED QUIT CLAIMS AND SECRECY AGREEMENTS. GERENDE WAS
PAID $10,000 AND LIEMPTY-19 $2500 AS TERMINATION BONUSES, AND THE
PAYMENTS WERE MADE ON A MONTHLY BASIS SO THAT THE STATION WOULD HAVE
SOME CONTROL OVER THE TWO AND THEREBY KEEP THEIR REACTION STATUS.
FROM EMERGING DURING THE DIVORCE PROCEEDINGS.
LIEMPTY-19 UNEXPECTEDLY APPEARED AT HOS IN AN ATTEMPT TO GET A LARGER
ON 8 JULY 1970
TERMINATION BONUS. SUBSEQUENTLY LIEMPTY-19 AND HER CHILDREN WENT TO
RESIDE IN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS, WHERE SHE WAS PAID THE REST OF HER
TERMINATION BONUS VIA MONTHLY CHECKS. SENT TO HER BROTHER IN THE
HQS. AREA. SHE WAS LAST REPORTED TO BE WORKING AS A SECRETARY AT THE
U.S. MISSION IN THE HAGUE.
4. ACCORDING TO MEXICO CITY 19452, 10 APRIL 72, THE LAST:
STATION CONTACT WITH GERENDE WAS IN MAY 1971, WHEN HE RECEIVED THE
FINAL INSTALLMENT OF TERMINATION BONUS. CABLE NOTED THAT GERENDE
APPEARED FINANCIALLY PRESSED, BUT WAS GIVING DAILY ENGLISH CLASSES
AND RENTING HIS HOUSE TO STATION STAFFER JESSE R. GARDALPHE.
WAS NO INDICATION THAT EITHER GERENDE OR HIS WIFE HAD VIOLATED THEIR
THERE
SECRECY AGREEMENTS. STATEMENT, WAS MADE THAT HE NO LONGER APPEARED
TO BE DRINKING EXCESSIVELY.
5. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT GERENDE'S AGENT SERVICE RECORD
QUALIFIES RECOMENDATION FOR HIS REUSE BY SAYING THAT HE SHOULD HAVE
SUFFICIENT OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT INCOME TO OBVIATE THE NEED FOR FULL-
TIME REACTION EMPLOYMENT, AND HAVE RESOLVED HIS PERSONAL PROBLEMS,
IT WOULD APPEAR THAT EXCEPT FOR A POSSIBLE ROLE IN SERVICING SPECIFIC
OPS SUPPORT TASKS, CERENDE OFFERS LITTLE POTENTIAL FOR THE STATION.
SUGGEST THAT THE STATION MAY WISH TO DISCUSS GERENDE WITH THEODORE
.G. KINDOPP (P) UPON. HIS ARRIVAL, SINCE GERENDE WAS HIS LANDLORD'
DURING PREVIOUS STAY IN MEXICO.

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION: SUBJECT made three specific requests of the Agency:
A) That she be released from the stipulation in her secrecy agreement which
prohibits her from revealing her or her husband's affiliation with the Agency, in
order that she may substantiate her husband's salary to be awarded support payment
from her husband.
B) If her first request cannot be fullfilled, that she be awarded a higher amount
of support from the Agency...

C) If neither of the above two can be fullfilled, that she be sent the Agency

stated she feels she must permanently leave Mexico City because of threats made on
her life by her husband, and cannot meet Victor Bellini (allegedly Agency contact)
at the specified restaurant location on a monthly basis to receive her check, as
is the present requirement.
SUBJECT reiterated her statement that she cannot stay in Mexico City because
of her husband's activities directed against the welfare of both herself and her
children. By way of reference, SUBJECT mentioned the names of Victor Bellini,
Bill Mills, and Don Vogel; all of whom are allegedly Agency personnel in Mexico
City.
SUBJECT was advised that the undersigned could not make a decision on any

SUBJECT thanked the undersigned for the interview afforded her and departed the

SRCD and initiated an indices search which produced records of one covert source

referred the matter to Messrs. Kenneth Carroll, CB, and Greg Maruca, WH/SO, who
requested and will be furnished with a copy of this report, and will initiate
further checks within WH Division.
In the opinion of the undersigned, SUBJECT was completely
coherent and sincere in her conversation, and seemed completely rational in her
conversation and actions.

SUBJECT:
GERENDE's Wife's Visit to Washington
1. On 6 July 1970, Mr. Walt Raymond of the CA
Staff advised that GERENDE's wife was in Washington
Apparently Mr.

.
Ramond and GERENDE's wife had been acquainted for
some time in the past. Neither admits that Mr. Raymond

she wanted to get in touch with someone in Agency
Headquarters. Mr. Raymond advised her he would contact
his liaison people to see what could be done.
2. DIRECTOR 048632 was sent to the Station out-
lining this and requesting Station's advice as to
whether a Headquarters representative should meet with
GERENDE's wife. MEXICO CITY 3612 (IN 117477) outlined
details of the termination of GERENDE and his wife and
recommended against seeing her.
3 I discussed this matter briefly with Mr. John
Green, Legal Counsel's Office, who felt even if Station

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION: SUBJECT came to the Main entrance of the Headquarters
building and asked the guard on duty to place her in touch with someone from the
Office of Security. The undersigned responded to the Main entrance and escorted
SUBJECT to the Main Reception area where she was interviewed. After displaying
some reluctance to speak openly, SUBJECT related that she had been employed on
a contract basis by the Agency at the Embassy in Mexico City. She gave in way of
biographic data that she is the daughter of a former Dutch embassy official statione
in Washington, that she was employed at the Dutch embassy in Mexico City, and it
was there that she met her presently estranged husband Ramon Alverez, who at the
time of their meeting was employed also on a contract basis with the Agency. She
stated that both she and her husband renounced their former citizenships to become
citizens of Mexico. After her marriage to Alverez she gained employ with the
Agency and stated that her specific duties included but were not restricted to the
Emonitoring and translation of tapes. SUBJECT stated that her husband was terminated
from Agency employment for Security reasons within the past year, and received at
he time of his termination, six months salary and the promise of $1000.00 per
month for 10 months. She stated that inasmuch as she is in the process of filing
(for divorce from her husband, and could not substantiate her husband's salary
in a court of law because of the termination agreement she has signed, the Agency
has agreed to and is paying her the sum of $250.00 per month which she is using to
support her four children of whom she has been awarded custody. She stated that she
is presently employed as a school teacher, but feels that she cannot provide ample
support to her children on her salary and the allowance furnished by the Agency.

In short, LIEPTY remains a highly effective and highly useful..

operationally, not simply collected for the files.
GEREDE
3. The GERENDE problem is unquestionably a serious one. Tra
are forwarding under separate cover copies of several memoranda
prepared by GERENDE. Ono outlines the history of his marital
problems, another describes the current legal situation, and a
third outlines proposals for a settlement. There is no hope of
reconciliation. The Station's position with GERENDE from the
start has been that he must agree to an amicable settlement with
his wife in order to insure that she would not feel forced to take
steps which would jeopardize the security of Station operations.
For this reason, the Station insisted from the beginning that any
financial settlement with his wife would have to take into account
the fact that he was receiving a certain salary from RYROCK, and
that he could not fairly keep this salary out of the settlement on
the grounds that his wife could make no legal claim to that
salary. GERENDE's wife was made aware of our position on this, and
she was grateful, even though she realized that this arrangement
was strictly informal. The Station felt that GERENDE could not be
allowed to uso his RVROCK salary as a weapon in the dispute with his
wife, because if he did, she could hardly be expected to refrain
from exposing his connections. Indeed, events have shown that
GERENDE's wife is a vindictive woman, and if it had not been clear
to her that she, as well as GERMIDE, would lose money if he loses
his job, she might have blown the whistle long ago. GERENDE, for
his part, would have preferred to keep his RVROCK salary entirely
out of the picture. Eventually, however, he agreed that the Station
position was fair, and he said he would conform.
:
4. The attached memoranda from GERENDE are, in the Station's
opinion, basically fair accounts. In the beginning, the Station
was inclined to give GERENDE's wife (LIEMPTY-19) the benefit of the
doubt, largely because her description of GERENDE's character
weaknesses came as no surprise (particularly his tendency to
procrastinate, even when his marriage was at stake). Early in the
conflict, LIEMPTY-19 contacted RIZZUTO and asked point blank what
she could tell her lawyer about GERENDE's salary. She was told
she could not mention the RVROCK portion under any circumstances,
and that if she told anyone that GERERIDE had any connection with
LNPURE, the connection would be denied and GERENDE would be
terminated. She appeared to accept this gracefully, even though it
meant she would have to scale her support demands down to the
level of GERENDE's overt income (GERENDE's monthly salary from
RVROCK was over 7,000 pesos; he earned an additional 4 to 5,000 pesos
teaching English, and he has since rented their house, for which
he is receiving slightly less than 7,000 pesos monthly).
Subsequently, LIEMPTY-19 was told that the Station would see to it
that as long as GERENDE continued to receive an RVROCK salary, he.
would give her the same proportion of this salary that the courts
determined should be paid from his overt income. This, of course
was strictly an informal arrangement, one which would stop the
minute GERENDE stopped receiving a salary. Later, as LIEMPTY-19's
position hardened and her vindictiveness began to rule her actions,
LIEMPTY-19 was reminded by the Station that the longer it took for
an amicable solution to be reached, the greater was the chance
that GERENDE would lose his job. If she persisted in having him
arrested (which she succeeded in doing twice), his job would be
jeopardized. While she continued to repeat sweetly that she had no
intention of causing his termination, and had never breathed a
word to a soul about his RVROCK affiliation, her attitude was in
fact jeopardizing his job and if he lost his job, she and the
children, as well as GERENDE, would lose income. Her attitude is

ACTION REQUIRED - MENEROKO
Reference: HMMA-38119, 18 November 1969
-
PRIORITY
SUMMARY
1. The LIEMPTY Project has thus far survived the absence from
duty of its principal agent, Raymond H. GERENDE, as well as the
threat to the security of the Project represented by GERENDE's
marital problems. Bruce H. FERNALD has been handling all Project
personnel sinco carly December 1969, when GERENDE was deactivated
and placed on half-pay. No problems have resulted from this, other
than a delay in the receipt of photos (FERNALD is unable to meet
LIEMPTY personnel as frequently as GARENDE was). The security
threat will remain as long as GERENDE's estranged-wife has it
within her power to expose GERANDE's RVROCK connection and the type
of work he was engaged in. She has continually promised not to do
this, and thus far she has kept her word.
2. The LIEMPTY product continues to be a valuable one for the
Station. It continues to play an important CI role (particularly
for LNERGO and LNREAD) but its greatest value, as far as the Station
is concerned, is in the positive field. Two recent examples
underline this: The early (and thus far only) debriefing of
AEMIDHIFF was accomplished almost exclusively by showing her photos
of all HARSH Embassy personnel and getting from her a character
sketch on each individual. These photos were all obtained by
LILYRIC and LICALLA. Secondly, LIEMPTY observations (as opposed to

Coubly disappointing in view of the fact that as she became more and
more unreasonable, GERENDE was moving in the other direction.
.'
5. The outcome can still not be predicted. As can be seen
from GERENDE's memos, the two sides are still far apart on a number
of points, including specifically money. LIEPTY-19 insists on
10,000 pesos per month. GARANDE is willing to pay 5,000. GERENDE
is currently on half-pay, which means that his total (all source)
monthly income is around 14,000 pesos. From this, he would not only
have to pay the amount which is finally agreed upon," he must also
continue payments of 2500 pesos per month to LIEMPTY-19's father
(paying off a loan obtained to build their house). The complicating
factor is the uncertainly of GERENDE's future with RVROCK. The
Station has maintained for some time that it is impossible to
continue to pay GERENDE his full salary solely torun the LICALLA
and LILYRIC basehouses. Now that FERGALD has absorbed this duty
with only small inconvenience and some loss of timeliness, it makes
even less sense to put GERENDE to work only to do this. GERENDE
has long been aware of the Station's thinking in this regard, and
prior to the current personal crisis he had been told that be
would have to work harder at a greater variety of tasks in order
to retain his position. As Headquarters is aware, he had been
given additional tasks, and, as reported in reference, he had begun
to respond very well. There has never been any question of GERENDE's
ability. As we have previously stated, he is personable, intelligent,
bilingual and binational, and has had good training and experienco
in certain fields. On the other hand,
On the other hand, there has long been doubt
about his seriousness of purpose, his initiative, and his ambition.
The "reversal of roles" which he describes in one of the attached
memos, which took place when he was confined to his home as an
LP keeper, did more than cause domestic problems it apparently
deprived him of the discipline of a daily job. His well-deserved
reputation for being lazy was earned years ago.
--
6. The question which
must be answered is whether or
not to terminate GERENDE. He can be useful to the Station, but
the Station has learned to get along without him. What are the
security hazards involved? The general range of his knowledge is
described in paragraph 5 of reference. If all of this were blown,
the loss to the Station, particularly in terms of support operations
against the MHHARSH target, would be considerable. The Station
does not believe that GERENDE would deliberately expose any of this,
but it is impossible to predict what LIEMPTY-19 might do, particularly
since she would feel that she had nothing to lose, having already
lost a possible source of income through the termination. GERENDE's
termination bonus would probably be in the neighborhood of ten
thousand dollars. Presumably LIEMPTY-19 is aware of the fact that
he would get such a bonus, although the Station has never discussed
this with her and the possible division of such a bonus between the
two of them has never been mentioned.
LICALLA
7. The LICALLA basehouse continues to function without changes,
except for the fact that Bruce H. FERNALD has been meeting LIEMPTY-9
since 9 December 1969. Brief meetings with LIEMPTY-9 are held once
a week at pre-arranged times and places (well away from the MHHARSH
(area). Occasionally special meetings are called, by phone, by
FERNALD, if special coverage is desired (as in the AESEASICK case,
for example). There have been no problems, operational or personal,
involving the basehouse or LIEMPTY-9 during the reporting period.
LIEMPTY-9 provided 1,728 photographs during the reporting period,
and in addition to his regular reporting on observed activities of
MHHARSH personnel, he provided special coverage as requested. This
"special coverage" consists of his observations of a selected
individual _ who does he spend his time with, how is he behaving,
when was he present (or absent), etc. LIEMPTY-9 spends over 40

hours a weck just watching (and photographing) MHHARSH personnel,
and over the years he has gottento know then, and their habits,

is asked to put a certain individual under close scrutiny, his
comments can be very useful. Newcomers, no matter what their
cover, will Irequently gravitate to their IS colleagues in the
"safety" of the UIARSH back yard, thereby enabling us to make
tentative ALKICK or AEGRIP identifications. TDYers can often be
linked up with their internal escort officers. In the case of
specific targets, LICALLA special coverage can sometimes give clues
to personal relationships which can be exploited. During the reporting
period we had special coverage on AESEASICK (to determine any
changes in pattern following the AEMIDRIFF defection and following
the operation against him ard in both cases LICALLA did report
some change in pattern); 201-305870 (for much the same reason,
although here the evidence was not as clear); AEPOLYP (to gather
information on bis patterns and his associations); AETAKEOFF
(for the same reason); and 201-833166 (to find out if he did,
in fact work in the "restricted area" and who his associates were,
a requirement which was quickly satisfied). Also, LICALLA has been
asked to report on the arrival and activities of TDYers such as
the AEKICK security inspectors (he is not, of course, told that
"security inspectors" are expected he is told of the expected
arrival of visitors, and he can spot a visitor or newcomer immediately),
the possible arrival of 201-314616 and, currently, to attempt to
identify, at least by association, the person who went out to meet
an LNREAD agent (subject of MEXICO CITY 2741, 17 March 1970). The
value of LICALLA to the REDTOP program in Mexico City can scarcely
be overstated.

8. There have been no changes during the reporting period of
the operation of the LILYRIC baschouse activity, except that Bruce
H. FERNALD took over the handling of the LILYRIC personnel from
GERENDE in early December. FERNAID normally meets only LIEMPTY–13,
at pre-arranged sites and times (also well away from the HARSH
area), once a week for pick-up of the films and reports. He occa-
sionally meets. LIEMPTY-14 (LIEMPTY-13's wife) when LIEMPTY-13 may
be out of town. The LILYRIC coverage is a family enterprise
with the work equally divided among LIEPTY-13, 1, -26, and -27,
who split up the hours of duty so that there is uninterrupted
coverage Mondays through Fridays from 0800 to 1800 hours, and
0800 to 1500 hours Saturdays. (Extra-hour or week-end coverage may
be requested as necessary, and the LILYRIC personnel responded to
the Station request for such extra coverage during the AMIDRIFF
and AESEASICK cases.) The family has continued to provide reports
during the reporting period on all activity centered on the front
entrance of the MHHARSH Embassy. Such coverage included, as in the
past, daily logs on the comings and goings of MITHARSH officials,
up-to-date recording of LHHARSH license numbers, special activities
and visitors (particularly Americans, of whom five were spotted and
reported on during the reporting period), and some 3,500 photographs.
As an example of the value of LILYRIC coverage, within one week of
the change of license plates at the MITHARSH Embassy (a biannual change
affecting all of Mexico, with new numbers bearing no relation to
the old), LILYRIC had provided a complete list of the new numbers
(along with the cars to which the plates are assigned). Among
other things, this enabled the Station to identify AESEASICK's
companions during his last few days in Mexico. Without LILYRIC,
identification of the new license plates would have taken months and
would have handicapped our operations. LILYRIC has also provided
special coverage of the visit of a Latin American CP representative,
and is currently watching for the two AEKICK security technicians,
201-314616, and the man who went to meet the LNREAD agent. Also,
LILYRIC has reported on visits of Mexican students and the identity
of the MHHARSH representatives who deal with them or hand out
literature to them. In short, LILYRIC's services, even though the

12. Regarding the project renewal for FY 1971, as far as
LICALLA, LILYRIC, and LIEMPTY-4 are concerned, to changes in
procedure are planned. The product is useful, it is as timely as
present circumstances permit, and the personnel involved are doing
their jobs well. The only change forescen is an increase in
salary for some, if not all, of these agents. The most recent
salary increases took effect in May 1968. LIMPTY-4 has not had
an increase since January 1967, and LIEMPTY-13. since January 1964.
Increase in cost of living alono would be sufficient justification
to raise salaries, but in the case of these agents their consistently
excellent work deserves to be rewarded. These salary increases
will probably range between 10 and 20 percent.
13. As for other project expenses, LIEMPTY-10 and LIEMPTY-11
will no longer be funded under LIEMPTY, but have been transferred
to LIEMBRACE effective 1 July 1970. Real estate expenses should
remain fairly constant, with perhaps a slight allowance for
inflation. The rent on GEREDB's dark room (MEXI 137) will no.
longer be paid with his termination. MV-2823 will be sold or
otherwise disposed of and should not be included in the project
for FY 1971. Equipment and operational expenses should remain
constant.

act accordingly, are another vital element of the RDTOP program.

9. LIEMPTY-4 bas continued to develop and to print all of
the LYCALLA and LILYRIC photographs. He has been met regularly by
Bruce H. FERNALD (taking over for GERENDE) since 26 November 1969.
The first few meetings at that time (late November and early
December) were arranged by FERNALD by telephone to LIEPTY-4 and
primarily concerned LIEMPTY-4's reports on GERENDE's family problems
and related security arrangements. Since mid-December, LIEMPTY-4
resumed a regular schedule (usually weekly) of meetings at
pre-arranged sites and times. LIEPTY-4 has been given a special
extension in the Station to which he may call as "Dr. Carlos" to
leave a message for "Victor" (FEINALD). FERNALD can change meeting
plans by directly calling LIEMPTY-4. The only personal problem
directly involving LIEPTY-4 was surgery on his knee which required
his wearing a full cast on his leg for over six weeks. During
this period when LIEMPTY-4 has been unable to drive, FERNALD has
been meeting LIEMPTY-4, for the exchange of LICALLA/LILYRIC films
and prints, at LIEMPTY-4's office, under a suitable pretext and with
appropriate security precautions. LIEMPTY-4's services are
invaluable since the Station could not, on a continuing basis,
process the LIEMPTY material in its own photo làb.

SECURITY
10 Other than the security problems inherent in GERENDE's
personal problems, there have been no security problems during the
reporting period.
FUTURE PLANS
11.
As for GERENDE, the Station has reached the conclusion
that he must be terminated. This is not an easy decision to make,
nor will it be easy to confront GERENDE with this decision. He
has, after all, devoted 15 years of his life to RVROCK. However,
as noted above, in spite of his talents the Station has been able
to get along without his services. Furthermore, the constant
security risk posed by his wife is, frankly, an unacceptable risk.
To try to molify her by promising her a portion of his salary is
· probably unworkable in realistic terms, particularly since her
attitude has progressively hardened. The Station, therefore,
intends to terminate GERENDE prior to the end of FY 1970. GERENDE's
contract calls for a termination bonus of one month's salary per
full year. This would come to $8,750 (USD). For various reasons,
including the need to preserve the security of the operation by
ensuring that the termination is amicable, it will probably be
necessary, as stated in paragraph 6, to give GERENDE about $10,000
(USD). Furthermore,
Furthermore, it will be necessary to inform LIEMPTY-19 of
the termination, and, to keep her from revealing what she knows,
she will undoubtedly have to be given some money herself.
The
Station does not believe that it would be equitable or so und from
a security point of view to use the money which GERENDE himself has
earned for this purpose. Therefore, while the figure will remain
negotiable, the Station believes that the sum of $2,500 (USD)
would be a reasonable amount. Total obligations for FY 1970 in:
the LIEPTY Project are currently estimated at slightly less than
$33,000 (USD). The Project has been approved in the amount of
$38,970 (USD) leaving unobligated approximately $6,000 (USD). It
is therefore requested that the LIEMPTY Project be amended for
FY 1970 to provide an additional $8,000 (USD) to be used in the
GERENDE termination. Funds will be available at the Station.

SUBJECT:
1.
GERENDE Background and Status Report
of Present Marital Conflict
While this is not intended to be a full exposition of my
personal and private life over recent years, I would like to make
known some of the factors that have, from my point of view, led
up to the present situation.
2. I realize that the interests of the organization and the
interest of the individuals who may have opportunity to come in
contact with my case dictate as little personal involvement as
possible in the lives of agents. Indeed, the requirements of
security, compartmentation and efficiency prescribe the modue
operandi and, to a great extent the modus vivendi, of agency
personnel not only in the sense of earning a living but also in
manner of living. Ideally, the less said about an agent's private
life, the better, but, as the years go by, changes may occur which
go unreported or unnoticed and which may bring about unexpected
events and repercussions. When . person has been working for the
Station, as I have, for fifteen years with little or no personnel
handling problems, no security flaps, no obvious problems on the
job, and something cones up like the abrupt separation of my
wife (LIMPTY-19) and me with the personal and potential security
risks it has entailed, I feel that some explanation is necessary.
Should it be in order, I would like this explanation to reach not
only my present case officer and Chief of Station but also the
former Chief and officers with whom I have had the privilege to
work over the years.
3. I would like to give thanks, in advance, for the patience
and understanding that have been shown me thus far. Whatever the
final outcome, I know that people have been bending over backward
to be helpful and patient in hopes of an early solution to the
conflict.
4. Back in September 1959, shortly after our wedding in late
1958, my wife and baby girl, were moved, by the agency, into a

spacious, carpeted, furnished apartment near the DIZTAG Embassy,
which served intermittently as a listening post-basehouse for the
agency. At the time, LIEPTY-19 was working as the manager of the
bookstore at the University of the Americas and, at the same time,
studying for a B.A. in philosophy. Thos. were happy tires. Wie
received a two-month leave, went to Mirope, the Rome Olympics and
visited LIEPTY-19's family in kollano. Back in Mexico, when the
base was in operation J stayed time a lot (one of the requirements),
minded the dial and tape recorders and the baby an unfortunate
reversal of marital roles. After exactly five years the baschouse
was closed down and we lost rent, LIEMPTY-19's salary and my.
mother's salary which she had been receiving as part-time basehouse
keeper. My nother and youngest sister gave considerable help in
taking care of the baby while LIEMPTY-19 worked and when we wont
to Europe and left the baby with them. This was during the first
three years at the base until we had our second child, Christopher.
5. We moved to a small apartment in Lomas and, to supplement
the loss of salary and rent allowance, the Station began paying
1,000 pesos a month for the use of a dark room I had built on the
roof of the building. We had our third child, Madeleine, unplanned,
two months after settling in the two-bedroom apartment. The
a partment need not have been so small but we had chosen it for its
location and style and because it was to be a temporary stop until
we could find something better. We missed going to the Olympics
in Tokyo which we had planned to do (1964) and instead began
negotiating to buy a home building site at Rio Escondido but when
the deal fell through, we decided to go on leave to Europe again,
this time with the two older children, leaving the baby with my
sister. Se visited with LIIPTY-19's parents in Holland (they had
moved back to Holland after having lived in Washington. D.C., since
1943) and the two children, stayed with them while LIEMPTY-19 and I
made side trips. Traveling is LIEMPTY-19's greatest love in life.
Upon our return to Mexico (I came back two weeks earlier), LIEMPTY-19
was so depressed at leaving Europe and being back in Mexico she was
emotionally and physically inaccessible for about six weeks. She
had not fully adjusted to living in Mexico or to settling down and
becoming a housewife. Our cramped quarters, way of living, lack
of money, my job, my irregular hours and habits, my Friday night
poker games; the three children, all these got her down.

6. In the fall of 1965 after our return from Europe I began
teaching English to beginners in the adult education program at the
American School in the evenings. This started as a two-hour a
week moonlighting experiment but by carly 1966, through student
contacts made at the school, I had branched out to teaching at the
offices of Carnation Wilk Co., Singer Sewing Machine, and
Richardson-Merrell Drug Co. for a total of about twenty hours per
week. LIEMPTY-19, meantime, was working part-time at the Hamilton
School in Lomas where the two older children were attending. The
family finances improved and I was able to convince LIEMPTY-19 that

"abandon" the children. I refused to visit her lawyer with her
saying I was not interested in getting divorced, whereas she said
that her mind was made up and that we would have to split up.
11.
"
Things came to a head on the night of 12 November when I
got home around 9 PM and she suggested we have a drink and talk
things over. I mixed some martinis and she began laying down the
terms under which she thought we should get divorced, i.e. I should
move out of the house, mortgage to pay back her father's money,
grant her custody of the children and support of 2,000 pesos per
month per child ($8,000). I said I would not get divorced under
those conditions and we discussed and argued in the kitchen for about
three hours, killing a bottle of gin in the process. We went
upstairs and when I tried to make up to her she tried to rouse the
children, unsuccessfully, and then tried to leave the house which
I would not let her do. She got hysterical, phoned a neighbor,
Uta de la Hoz, then she went into the front yard and awakened the
next door neighbors, Walter Hurley and his wife, and asked to go to
their house. A few minutes later, Uta and her husband Guillermo
came and LIEMPTY-19 went with them to their home two blocks away.
About a half-hour later I walked up to Uta's to ask LIEMPTY–19
to come home but was told that she was busy phoning her lawyer
and would not return.
:
12. The following morning I took the children to school as
usual and my sister Marcia (LIEPTY-4's wife) picked them up and
took them to her house where I joined them for lunch. LIMPTY-19
came by in the late afternoon while my sister was out, picked up
the children saying she was taking them home, failed to do so, then
disappeared and was not to be found.
13.
It was the subsequent action taken by LIEMPTY-is in
dropping her lawyers and taking on the services of Bernabe Jurado,
the most notorious penal attorney in Mexico, that led to the
potential security hazards that ensued.

i,
the best thing to do was to invest in Land and build a house big
enough for our growing family which by now had a fourth child on
the way.
With three friends as partners, I entered on a land-buying
deal which turned out to be complicated as we bought the land in
the form of company stock. The company was liquidated and the
assets were distributed, as land, to the four partners. I paid for
our share with the proceeds from the sale of a small lot I had been
paying for since 1955. LIEMPTY-10 was at first reluctant to tie
us down with a house but when we finally got the papers and land
deed straightened out, she threw herself wholeheartedly into the
project and the building which began in August 1967. While LIEMPTY-19
Supervised the construction, I worked during September and October
almost full-time for the Olympic Organizing Committee and the group
from Czechoslovakia which came to train in the pre-Olympics. My
father-in-law deposited money in Nexico to help us with the ma joy
part of the financing of the house. We used $286,500 pesos of his
money and about $60,000 that LIEMPTY-19 and I had saved and got the
house finished enough to move in in March 1968. We were very short
on furniture and shortly after moving in bought three bedroom sets,
an automatic washer and even a piano. Naturally, cash was scarce,
dirt was plentiful. The yard was a pile of rubble, the carpentry
work had just begun, there were no closets, the house was unpainted.
Thereafter, we did things on the house as the money came in:
continued with carpentry, finished the driveway, put in grass,
built a fence and front gate.
"
7. Six months after moving in came time for the Olympics and
I worked, unofficially this time, with the water polo team from
Australia. LIAMPTY-19 worked for the month with the Dutch and
Belgian radio and TV group. LIEMPTY-19 was, once again, caught up
in the atmosphere of being among Europeans and doing something
exciting and out of the routine of home and children. She fell in
love with the Australians as well, and for several months all she
could talk of was that we should move to Australia. I gave it some
thought but decided that we had neither the money to invest nor the
youth and technical training to make it as pioncers "down under"
and, on the other hand, family, friends, a house, and job seniority
here in Mexico.
8.
Toward the end of 1968, LIEMPTY-19 decided it was time for
same to move out of the master bedroom as she could no longer face
mathat aspect of our married life. For several months we tried this
but it did not work out for me. One night in March 1969 after we
mereturned home from a party, she asked me to help her undress and
> when she, once again, refused to have anything to do with me, I
got rough with her, prompting a decision on her part, which she
had already been pondering, to visit her parents in Holland as soon
as possible. Her father provided the plane fare and she left in
April for the United States to visit her brother and sister and
Holland, for what she said would be a five week trip. She stayed
Laway ten weeks. The four children remained with me, the maid, and

Lecumberri. The judge is CPE Mallacic. These charges have
not been pressed since they were originally made on 13 November
1969 by LIEMPTY-19. The ruling on these charges, should the
case come to trial, must be made by three judges of the 2ª Corte
Penal composed of the 4th, 5th, and 6th Juzgados Penales. The
judge of the 6° Juzgado is Lic. QUIRAZCO, an alumnus of
GERENDE's lawyer, Jorge Mario MAGALLON. Together they have,
on two occasions, been to speak to Judge CRUZ Mellado who
agreed not to issue an arrest warrant and who has, finally,
called for a hearing on 16 March (subsequently postponed) at
10:00. MAGALLON has given GERENDE assurances that the charges
are likely to be dismissed.
--
'
b. Fraud this charge was made by LIEMPTY-19 and her
lawyer on 11 December 1969, the day after GERENDE left the
Villa Obregon jail after having spent a week there for
disobeying a court order. (The court order had consisted of
an unfounded request to have GERENDE expelled from his house
and to have LIEMPTY-19 reinstated there with her father, as
the temporary custodian of the children. GERENDE refused them
admission under those terms, hence disobeying the Villa Obregon
judge's order, so the judge's secretary arbitrarily ordered,
on the spot, a 10-day detention. Subsequently, the judge,
LUCAS del ARENAL, was forced to lift the detention after seven
days and dismiss himself from the case and divorce proceedings
as incompetent. The judge has had to face charges of
collusion from and with the lawyers of both parties, i.e.
Magallon and Jurado. The charge of fraud rests at Mesa 31ª
of the Procuraduria del Distrito Federal. The Public Ministry
Agent in charge of that table is Jorge GUTIERREZ Cruz.
LIEMPTY-19 claims that the money lent to her and GERENDE for
building the house at Ladera #39 was actually loaned to buy
the house and that GERENDE, knowing they were married under
the separate property marriage clause and wrongfully placed
the property in his name only, thereby committing fraud.
Actually, the land was bought by GERENDE before Christmas 1965
in a complicated transaction involving three other partners:
Robert Bancroft WHITEHOUSE, John (Dick) RENNA, and Janes
Walter HURLEY, and each of the partners placed the property
in their respective names with the complete knowledge of their
spouses. Later the land was subdivided and after nineteen
months the deeds were issued. LIEMPTY-19 supervised and prodded
the notary who made the transaction and she was perfectly aware
that the property was in GERENDE's name. In August 1967 when
construction of the house began, LIEMPTY-19's father's money
was used which he had deposited in Mexico for the purpose.
Since January 1969, according to the terms of the loan
agreement, GERENDE has been paying it off and has receipts from
LIEMPTY-19 to show for it.
GERENDE has presented both the land deed ("escritura")
pre-dating the construction of the house and the receipts

LIEMPTY-19 bore an air of resignation rather than of enthusits and,
Upon her return,
again, as on her previous return from Europe, was physically down
and mentally unhappy. When asked about her thoughts on Australia
she said that if she had wanted to live in Australia, she should
have married an Australian. The separation had not improved our
intimate relationship.
9. In August I was to take five weeks' leave and go with the
children to Astro-World in Houston and visit my mother's family in
South Carolina. When I suggested postponing making monthly payments
on her father's loan until December when the Christmas Bonus would
cover the back debt, in order to make the trip, she was adamant.
saying that if I did not have the cash for going, I should not take
leave. I borrowed from my life insurance policy and left with the
three youngest children. Adriana had a touch of hepatitis and
joined us three weeks later. After spending the month in South
Carolina, we returned to Nexico to find that LIEMPTY-19 had very
much enjoyed her solitude. We had already talked about divorce before
her trip to Hollard in the spring. I had told her that I would not
consider parting with the children and she said she would consider
leaving them to me if I would settle the debt to her father as well
as give her a substantial share of what she considered was her part
of the house. The title of the house was in my name and had been
since the buying of the land. LIEPTY-19 said I could mortgage or
sell the house but that the money was what she was mainly interested
13. I told her that the sale of the house was not financially
wise in its unfinished state and that the house and land are very
likely to appreciate sharply over the next three or four years
considering the housing developments going on in the area.
to this was the sentimental attachment to the house and area.

A
mortgage, on the other hand, for the amount of her father's loan
plus what she was asking, was something I could not afford considering
the more than 12 percent cost of such a mortgage in Mexico.

.10. At the same time, during September 1969, that we were going
through the above-mentioned discussions, LIEMPTY-19 was taking a
course at Japan Airlines to become a tour guide and group leader
for trips to the Orient as early as November 1969 and, certainly,
to Expo '70 in Osaka during the spring and summer of 1970. The
received a diploma to that effect. I told her that if she wanted
out of the marriage and wanted to be free to travel it was all
right by me but that the children would stay with me and I would
continue to repay her father at the agreed rate ($2500 per month
and 5 percent per year). She then sought legal advice from an old
friend, Dutch lawyer Guillermo Floris Margadant who, in turn, steered
her to a young woman lawyer, Dra. Berta Martinez, who must have
advised LIEMPTY-19 that under the local legal system the only way
to try for a sizable cash settlement and considerable support was to
hang on to the children because LIEMPTY-19 made a radical "about-face"
in her attitude concerning them and she now said that she could not

December 1969 at the 7° Juzgado Mixto de Paz claiming that
GERENDE had abandoned LIEMPTY-19 and the children to their fate

notified of this charge and on 9 February after attending a

from home taking the children with her, GERENDE brought charges
against her for minor lesions and showed medical proof thereof.
The hearing of 9 February after which GEREDE was detained, was
called by Villa Obregon judge Bonfilio SEGURA. GERENDE reiterated
the charge, LIEMPTY-19 denied it, the judge ruled against her,
ordered her to prison but since the injuries were minor, it does
not require privation of liberty and she must only go and sign-in
once a week.
7. LIEMPTY-19 is at present teaching school at the Edron
Academy on Caleri Street in San Angel Inn. The two older children
are going to school there. During the latter part of November, all
December and half of January, the children did not attend any
school. On three occasions GERENDE has been to the school at 13:30
to try to speak to LIEPTY-19 and see the children.
has objected to this and the meetings have been short and fruitless
LIEPTY-19
except for GERENDE learning that they are still staying at the Dutch
Ambassador's. GERENDE's last visit there was on 3 March (Tuesday).
8. After the Villa Obregon judge dismissed himself from the
divorce proceedings, according to standard procedure, the case
went to Coyoacan and Xochimilco respectively where the judges,
in turn, excused themselves from the case and it has finally come
to reside at the 1st Juzgado Civil in the D.F. The judge is Olda
CORREA (Homan) and has the reputation of being tough and pretty
straight. Since LIEMPTY-19 has not given an address where divorce
suit papers can be served her, the suit has not yet been initiated
on GERENDE's part. LIEMPTY-19, on the other hand, has not had

SUBJECT:
GERENDE Status Report
The present situation of the marital conflict between GERINDE and
his wife (LIEMPTY-19) is as follows:
1. GERENDE is living at his mother's apartment at 99 Carlos
B. Zetina Street, Apartment 9. He has rented a three-bedroom
apartment at Tornel 3 corner with Pedro Antonio de los Santos where
he has stored the household effects and furniture removed from his
former address at Ladera 59, Lomas de Bezares.
;
2. The house at Ladera 39 is rented to an executive of
Chrysler Corporation International, Dr. Leon MARKIEWICZ, his wife,
and fifteen-year old daughter, all of Argentine nationality. The
monthly rent is 6,700 pesos M/N and the contract is for two years,
beginning 1 February 1970.
3. LIEPTY-19 and the four children are apparently still
living at the residence of the Netherlands' Ambassador, Baron
Schelto Van Heemstra at Peña 360, Jardines del Pedregal. It seems
fairly certain they are at that address from things that the two
older children, Adriana and Chris, have said to GERENDE on the last
two occasions he has seen them. They have been there since
5 December 1969. LIEMPTY-19 has denied that she has a fixed address
and says that she is staying with "friends.
4. LIEMPTY-19 is continuing to use the services of Bernabe
Juardo as her lawyer and, through him, is pressing for even more
advantageous terms in the divorce than she had asked in November.
Please see the attached copy and translation of the latest proposal
made by Juardo on 4 March 1970.
5.
The charges and accusations made by LIEMPTY-19 against
GERENDE are still not completely resolved and are as follows:
this charge
a. Insults, threats and attempted homicide
rests at the 5° Juzgado Penal, 2ª Corte Penal located at.

abstaining from calling on the mother's address, so that she may
carry on her life freely without neglecting her children.

10. While the voluntary divorce is being processed, the
mother and children will live at
above stated, to satisfy their needs, the father will make the
first monthly payment of $10,000.
11. Neither the father nor the mother may take the children
out of Mexican territory without the authorization of the other.
12. Since GERENDE owes the parents of LIEMPTY-19 the sum of
$286,500 plus agreed-on interest, minus whatever payments he has
been able to make, the said GERENDE is obliged to mortgage the house
at 39 Ladera, Lomas de Bezares in this city, precisely during the
course of the divorce procedure by mutual consent as established.
in the antecedent clauses and before the divorce is granted so that
LIEMPTY-19's parents are reimbursed on their loan or on the out-
standing unpaid balance.
13. The expenses of making this agreement à formal writ as
well as the fees of B. Juardo will be paid by GERENDE but these
will be fixed in an equitable manner by Carlos Heyn to whose
decision both will submit.
14. In case of failure to comply with any of the clauses of
this agreement at any time or for just one time, either by GERENDE
or LIEMPTY-19, both agree to expressly establish the following
sanctions and terms:
15.
If GERENDE is the one who violates any clause just one
time, he will forfeit the house at Ladera 39 to the mother and
children, "LIEMPTY-19, Adriana Juliette, Christopher Ramon, Maria
Madeleine, and Laurence Fernando, and said property will belong to
the above mentioned persons.
16. If LIEMPTY-19 is the one who violates the terms of this
agreement for just one itme, she will lose the custody of children
in favor of the father or whatever person he designates for the
guardianship and custody of the minors.
17. Since LIEMPTY-19 has to establish an appropriate place
to live, in the company of her four children, both parties agree
that the household effects will be turned over by GERENDE, to
LIEMPTY–19 for that purpose, as well as the automobile she has been
using throughout the marriage.

LIRAZOR/Progress Report for the Period 1 August-30 September 1969
|ACTION REQUIRED - REJESENCES
ACTION REQUIRED:
REFERENCE
For Your Information
: HMMA-37623, 4 August 1969 (Last Progress Report)
1. Although this report might normally be submitted one month
from now, the use of Oliver G. SCANTLING has shifted sufficiently
to warrant a special report at this time. Our next progress report
will be submitted for the period 1 October through 31 December un-
less exceptional circumstances justify another change.
2. The fundamental change in the use of SCANTLING (who has
suïfered the past six weeks from paratyphoid) is that he has been
divorced from routine cut-out operations and will henceforth be
used for priority tasks and targets which will better utilize his
proven talents. First, in late September ZARBOCK took over LICASA-1
for direct handling. The LICASA operation offered no particular
challenge to SCANTLING and it is doubtful that his intermediary role
offered any particular additional security in this case. In fact,
if a flap should ever develop in this case SCANTLING would just add
one more local who would have to be extricated from the tongs of the
GON. Second, it has been decided that SCANTLING will very soon turn
LIANVIL-1 over to Raymond GERENDE. The details are presently being
worked out.
'
3. PLANS: In line with our decision to use SCANTLING for re-
cruitment efforts principally (and less so for routine agent handling)
he is presently preparing for a recruitment attempt against Subject of
* MEXICO CITY-1502. When that operation is completed he will be tar-
geted against the HARSH target both through a commercial outlet of
the Bloc and through various clubs and sports centers where he may
have access to NHHARSH types. Aside from these responsibilities, he
will be used as needed in other recruitment situations especially in
support of a new surveillance team.

Over 20 years service, three months
salary plus one month's pay for each full year
of service.
(4) All payments above are to be calculated
at the rate of pay applicable at the time of
retirement and/or resignation.
3. As to the points raised by WH/Contracts in their
Memorandum concerning this amendment we would like to note
the following:
A) GERENDE is a Mexican citizen, working for the
Agency since 18 March 1955 under an MOC, who considers
himself to be a "career" employee of the Agency, and
whose initial local employment for cover purposes was
largely notional under a system of "ghost payrolling".
GERENDE received no income or benefits from this "cover"
position which terminated due to the demise of the
company on 31 December 1967. GERENDE's other "cover"
is self generated in that he gives English lessons in
his spare time to middle management Mexican nationals
employed by American owned companies in Mexico City.
His income benefits from this "cover" are minimal, but
suffice for satisfying acquaintances as to the source
of his income. In conclusion, GERENDE is considered by
the Station to be a full time contract agent, on call
at all times for operational activity. Any other local
benefits which may accrue to him by the virtue of his
being a Mexican citizen should not, we feel, be a concern
of this Agency given the above circumstances of his employ-
ment with us.
4. This Branch is of the belief that the resignation
and/or retirement schedule outlined in paragraph 2, B above
provides career benefits for GERENDE in the event that he
must resign and/or retire in the event of unforseen personal
circumstances. It additionally rewards him for his loyalty.
of service, and at the same time provides him with incentive
to remain in Agency service for the additional financial
benefits that will accrue to him providing both future
security and incentive.

b. The following ushodule in the event of resignation

Less than 15 years service (prior 18 Harch 1970)--

18 March 1975)--three nonths plus 29 days for each

Over 20 years--three months plus 1 month for oach

2. The Station has pointed out that Bexican law requires
on cuployer (presuming that we are being considered an an
employer in the sense of Mexican law) to (pant an employee
who is torniated three months pay plus an additional 20 days
pay for each full year of service. In the event of resignation,
Rexican law does not make any requirement for payment by the
employer to the individual.
3. GEREND's Lasic contract was cffective 1 October 1955.
AD amendment, offective 1 July 1950, providea for a terminal
Payment of one months salary for each year of service since
18 March 1055, and thus bears out the mention's use of tho

MEMORANDUM FOR:

WH/FI
SUBJECT
:
WH/CONTRACTS
Recommendation to Amend the Contract of
Raymond H. GERENDE (Contract Agent) to
Include Improved Termination Benefits
and a Salary Increase
:
1. During the past year Mexico City Station has
submitted several dispatches recommending that paragraph
11 of Subject's contract be amended to include new benefits
in the event of Subject's termination and/or resignation
from Agency service. These Station recommendations have
been carefully reviewed by C/WH/Contracts and a Memorandum
was forwarded to C/WH/1 containing guidance on the suggested
contract amendment.
2.
The above information has been reviewed again by
AC/WH/1, and we are requesting approval for the following
amendments to paragraph 11 of Subject's contract:
A) In the event of GERENDE's termination by the
Agency he will receive three month's pay plus one
month's pay for every full year of service since
18 March 1955, calculated at the rate applicable at
the time of termination.
B) In the event of resignation and/or voluntary
retirement upon 60 days notice the following schedule
would be acceptable to the Agency as being in its best
interests and a payment considered as a terminal payment
as follows:
(1) Less than 15 years service (prior to March
1970) 20 days pay for each full year of service.
(2) Over 15 years service, but less than 20
years service (prior 18 March 1975) three months
salary plus 20 days pay for each full year of service.

5. During the past two years GERENDE has served as
a principal agent handler for a sensitive fixed sur-
veillance project; has carried out unilateral recruitment
approaches against the Cuban target; has been used in
special support investigations; and is presently being
considered for use in special operations of a sensitive
nature. A review of the progress reports in GERENDE's
operations discloses that the Station has been more than
satisfied with GERENDE's performance and is anxious to
take advantage of his full potential. GERENDE's last.
salary increase from $6,000 to $6,500 per annum was granted
in July 1965, and there have been no increases since.
Since the Field Station/Headquarters negotiation over
amendment of paragraph 11 of GERENDE's contract has been
in progress for over one year and a half, we are of the
belief that the Station wished to finalize this amendment.
prior to requesting a salary increase for the agent. It
is therefore requested, considering the above, that approval
be given for a salary increase from $6,500 to $7,000 ef-
fective 1 August 1969, and that his contract be so amended.
The Field Station will be queried for their approval via
cable prior to implementation of the contract amendment.
