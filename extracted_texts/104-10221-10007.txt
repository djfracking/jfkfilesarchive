training site with most of the training taking place a ſes ciles south
The local cover story was that IUPAGAN was training pilots
of Iden C.
with view of using them to ferry helicopters to northwestern PePRIME,
where they would be utilized by IUPEAK. Cover story was backstopped.

Some
no security problems encountered during the training perina
of the precautions taken were use of alias identification, first name

The
primary purposes of this program was to prepare two WITHRUSH

employces (Iden

erations. Secondarily, Idens A and B were to be familiarized to the
fullest extent with the operational capability of the helicopter and
Iden B com….

of aircraft and failed to complete transition training.
.C
plete transition training. Iden B completed the prescribed training,
evidencing consistent performance progress as well as alertness, in-
dependence and a cooperative attitude.
2
Period of Training:
Training commenced for Iden A on 15 March and for Iden B. on 27.
March. Iden B's training was satisfactorily completed on 15 April. A
total of 50 hours of training time was logged during the entire course
of instruction.
3.
Instructors:
The training instructors utilized were Alexander V. DECLIPPEL and
Iden C. IUPAGAN PDO's provided training as to cargo sling operation,
rappelling and operational capabilities of special equipment.
Training Areas Utilized:
Training was conducted entirely within Iden D utilizing suitable
terrain in the vicinity of Idens E, F, G, and H. Airports and motel
accommodations in or adjacent to these localities were used.

The language barrier between student and instructor retarded
the student's progress to some extent. His navigation, flight plan-
ning and weight and balance work is limited. It is recommended that
he have access to a helicopter each day in order to buildup his time.
d. The student was willing, cooperative and intelligent.
IDEN G
a. Iden G's training schedule included much of the same material
as that of Iden F except that his personnel rappelling, parachuting

a.
:
Iden B received training which exposed him to all aspects
of Bell 47G3B1 helicopter flight and support requirements.
...
b. The flight familiarization included almost all of the
normal helicopter maneuvers along with radio procedures. His
total flight time amounted to 5+30 hours. Both instructor pilots
noted that his flying procedures were rough, but were improving
steadily. He did not solo inasmuch as both pilots indicated that
he was not ready for solo.
c. Iden B wash given approximately 9 hours orientation in
helicopter maintenance and from 3-4 hours of orientation with re-
gard to the contents of the support kits and accessory equipment.
d. Complete assessment of this individual is difficult to
make, as he was only in the training area for a short period of
time. However, the following information may be helpful in making
an evaluation:
4
PELANDER.
1) Flying proficiency in 47G3B1 is below par at this time.
He requires more dual and emergency procedures..
2) His conversation and experience indicates that he is
more knowledgeable of Hughes equipment than he is of Bell
equipment.
3) Iden B appears to be a very extroverted type of in-
dividual. In any conversation he does most of the talking.
4) The instructor pilots felt that his knowledge of hel-
icopters leaned to the "manual" side rather than the practical
side. He seemed, according to the instructor pilot, to have
a "shallow" knowledge of helicopter operations.
The case officer for the WITHRUSH pilot training was Alfred F..
Instructor pilots were Iden H and Alexander V. DECLIPPLE.

Sound operational security practices were employed in the handling
of Idens A and B as to relationship with the general public. It was
not necessary for either the instructors or the students to refer to IU………
FLAG in dealings with the general public. A logical cover of training
for IUPEAK operations sufficed to handle any local inquiries concerning
reasons for the aircraft's being in the vicinity or the purposes of the
training. No known breaches of security as to identity of personnel or
the true purposes of the training occurred.

Critique:
a.
The training program should be formalized to a greater degree.
A syllabus of items to be covered has been prepared and reviewed by
Alexander V. DECIPPEL. A copy of this syllabus is attached and it is
felt will assist in providing a guide to the instructor and permit a
more orderly procedure and better utilization of time epended. It can
be adapted easily as a statistical report covering training.
b. The training areas utilized from a standpoint of terrain, climate
and accessibility for maintenance proved acceptable.

2. On 15 December, Ernesto Despaigne, the кdministrative officer,
confronted these men with the information in the attached memorandum.
then admitted that they forged the passports themselves for the purpose
of obtaining a visitors visa to Spain. They also claim that an unidentified

3. Both men have been told that their action in forging theso passports
was a very serious matter, particularly so since they are not yet PBPRIME
citizens. Sufficeth to say both were shaken considerably over the prospect
that we might make the attached information available to ODURGE.
4.
To the extent possible, JMWAVE is requested to inform future
contractees that if they commit such acts while on duty in the Congo they

Cuban pasaport number 46:28
issued at Havana, Cuba 26 August 1965.
-
• U.S. address: 2040 N. W. Flagler Avenue. Apt. 4. Miami.
1-512 Form dated March 15, 1965
4. A review of the records of these men revealed the following:
a. SOTO.. Arrived Leopoldville from Miami on 31 May 1965. If above
information correct, SOTO obtained a Cuban passport after his arrival here
because the alleged date of his passport is 7 June 1965, one week after his
arrival in Leopoldville,
b.
His
PADRON - Arrived Leopoldville 17 March via Pan Am.
Cuban passport, according to TOUART, was dated 26 August 1965, five
months after his arrival here.
5. I will investigate through Ernesto DESPAIGNE because it may be
that they have purchased pansporte after arrival here.
