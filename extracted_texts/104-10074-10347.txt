2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992
MEMORANDUM FOR:
J. D.-Lavery, OGG
Via
A. Addona DDO/PICG
Classification of EX 3600
Subject
Re your request for "a couple sentences of factual
data as to why this document is classified", here they are:
1 • Ex post facto, since I was not associated
with Operation MHCHAOS during its existence, I can only
offer the following reasonable surmise. As we now know,
during its tenure MHCHAOS was one of the most sensitive
operations conducted under DDP aegis, repeatedly sanctioned
(in writing) by the DCI. The activity was deemed so sensi-
tive that it was controlled by through extremely restricted
handling channels. I think it follows logically, at least
in my view, that any document produced by MHCHAOS, whether
a formal or informal one, would have been classified at
least SECRET.
Does the information in this document warrant
classification today. think it does, and I believe the
current classification of CONFIDENTIAL is proper

"
Pgs. 2 through 12 carefully, it is readily apparent that
some of the information on some of these pages was seemingl
acquired from/through sensitive sources/methods. Also
these pages contain frequent mention of FBI information con
cerning many of the Peace Movement groups/organizations
cited; FBI reports received by MHCHAOS were invariably
classified, for the most part CONFIDENTIAL.
3. What should be the proper FOIA exemption for EX
3600; in my view, (b)(3).
