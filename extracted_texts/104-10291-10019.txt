Several additional points should be noted. On 2 July
1973 PDDONOR signed an "Acknowledgment and Release" prepared
by the General Counsel in which PDDONOR releases and forever
dischar es the US Government and the Agency from any claim for
moncy promised to him. (Reference C) In addition, the issue
of the $20,000 he says is still owed him does not surface in
the file until September 1978 14 years after his defection.
The explanation of why this issue would arise at this late
date is not clear from available records

Attached are copies of those documents which impact.
on this issue. Because of the complexities of this case I
recommend that we request the Office of General Counsel to
review the entire case and provide a ruling on the legitimacy
of PDDONOR's claim of $20,000. After such a ruling we can
discuss our future course of action.

FROM
SUBJECT
OGC 79-02042
1 March 1979
Chief, Counterintelligence Staff
John A. Rizzo
Assistant General Counsel
Financial Commitments to PDDONOR/1
This is in response to your memorandum of
3 February 1979 which requests our opinion concerning CIA
existing financial obligations to PDDONOR/1, a former high-
ranking KGB officer who defected to this country in February
1964, after having cooperated in place for the previous two
years. Based on information contained in Ct Staff files,
there appears no question that the Agency made three docu
mented, unequivocal promises to PDDONOR/1 at the time of
defection:
a)
b)
c)
he would be paid a total of $50,000 ($25,000
-
per annum) in considération for his previous
two years' service in place;
he would receive a $10,000 payment for his
part in identifying a certain KGB operative
in the British government; and
he would be placed under contract for "an
indefinite period" after his defection at
yearly salary of $25,000, with accompanying
provision for retirement and other benefits.
- Your memorandum seeks our assistance in resolving the issue
of whether or not the Agency has, as PDDONOR/1 asserts, any
current, independent obligation to pay PDDONOR/1 $20,000
based on an oral commitment made to him by à now-retired CIA
officer at the time of his defection promising him the
Agency's financial assistance in his securing a residence
in this country.

2. As you know, due to unforseen and extraordinary
factors which arose shortly after PDDONOR's defection, the
three documented commitments made to him as outlined in the
previous paragraph were not fulfilled until some years after
his defection. In this connection, the file indicates that
PDEONOR/1 did not start receiving an Agency salary until
March 1969, and that it was not until six years later that
he began to be paid at the previously promised räte
$25,000 per annum. Accordingly, in order to belatedly
satisfy in full the commitments originally made to PDDONOR/1
in 1964, lump-sum payments have been made to him on three
occasions in recent years with the approval of senior Agency
management. Briefly, these lump-sum payments consisted of:
$125,000 (less taxes) in November 1972 to cover the
balance owed for salary during the period April 1964 to
March 1969 b) $15,000 in July 1973 to settle the remainder
due on the $50,000 obligation to PDDONOR/1 for his service
in place overseas prior to his defection; and c) $28,500
fauthorized in April 1976 but evidently not paid until late
last year) to cover the balance of his previously promised
$25,000 annual salary for the period March 1969 March 1975
as well as the $10,000 commitment originally made to PDDONOR/1
prior to his February 1964 defection (see paragraph 1(b)
above) for his role in identifying a certain KGB operative
in England.
°

J
3. As previously stated, the sole issue for considera
tion at this point revolves around PDDONOR/1's relatively
recent assertion that CIA still owes him $20,000 as a result
of a vaguely worded oral commitment made to him by a now-
retired Agency officer in 1964 who promised that CIA would
provide housing for PDDONOR/1 in this country following his
arrival. In analyzing PDDONOR/1's contentions in this
regard, we believe for the following reasons that the details
surrounding CIA's July 1973 payment to him of $15,000 assume
particular significance and do, in fact, firmly rule out any
further, outstanding legal obligation to him with respect to
payments to cover FØDONOR/1's eventual purchase of a home.
Of course, the key considération involved is the fact that
the $15,000 payment was made following PDDONOR/1's execution
of a quitclaim prepared by this office through which he
agreed to "release and forever discharge the Central
Intelligence Agency...from any claim for money promised to
him for, and/or at the time of his defection, and from any
and all other claims...in any form whatsoever arising out of
or in any way connected with his cooperation and association
with... CIA prior to the date of this document, 12 July
1973."

Thus, the wording of the quitclaim is clearly and purpose-
fully unconditional and is specifically intended to bar the
kind of belatedly raised claim which PDDONOR/1 is making now.
4. In taking this position, we recognize that one
could properly point out in rebuttal that notwithstanding
the seemingly all-encompassing scope of the quitelsim, a
further payment of $28,500 was in fact subsequently author-
ized for PDDONOR/1 in April 1976. However, as was noted in
an internal OGC memorandum dated 1 April 1976 which concurred
in this additional $28,500 payment, the real purpose of the
12 July release was to settle once and for all the issue
the balance of the $50,000 owed PDDONOR/1 for his two years
of in-place cooperation prior to his defection. Accordingly,
since the $28,500 payment was intended to satisfy other pre
existing commitments to PDDONOR/1 (1.e. back-salary owed
for 1964-1969 as well as the $10,000 promised for his role
in identifyig the KGB-operative in England), this office
concluded at that time that the payment was legally permissi-
ble since it was outside the intended scope of the quitclaim
and was being used to fulfill separate, fully documented
promises of compensation made earlier to him.

5. By contrast, at the time that CIA made its July
1973 payment to PDDONOR/1 in return for his quitclaim, the
available background materials contained in the files you
have provided us leave little doubt that the issue of compen-
sation to cover his purchase of a home was an intrinsic part
of the calculations which led to the decision to authorize
the $15,000 payment to him at that time. For instance, in
the 25 June 1973 memorandum to Mr. Colby which contained the
recommendation for the $15,000 payment, the Director o
Security delineated some of the previous advances made to
PDDONOR/1 in partial satisfaction of the $50,000 owed to him
for the 1962-64 period. It was specifically noted in that
connection that "[a]gainst this ($50,000] sum in April-May
1969, (PDDONOR/1] was given $8,000 as financial assistance
for resettlement in the private economy and $25,000 in mid.
1970 towards the purchase of a new house and other related
expenses (Emphasis added). These amounts plus an additional
$2,000 which had been previously advanced were subtracted
from the original $50,000 commitment, thus leading to the
final figure of $15,000 that was subsequently paid to PDDONOR/1
.
The
in July 1973 and for which he readily signed the quitclaim re-
leasing CIA from any further financial obligations to him.
Director of Security's memorandum went on to indicate that
PDDONOR/1 "agreed" with these calculations; moreover PDDONOR/l's
acknowledgment that CIA had previously fulfilled its

commitments to him regarding a house is more explicitly
documented in a 14 August 1972 memorandum for the file from
the Deputy Chief, Security Research Group, which quotes
PDDONOR/1 as saying that he "considers that the assistance
in purchasing furniture, a house, etc. which he has been
given since 1969 should be considered as cancelling the
matter of the $50,000 (Emphasis added).
Therefore, from all of the above, it must be con
cluded that, contrary to PODONOR/1's assertions, CIA has
long since fulfilled any promises which Agency representa
tives made to him prior to his defection concerning his
housing in this country. Further, the available evidence
clearly tends to indicate that PDDONOR/1 fully understood
and accepted the fact that these obligations had been fully
met at the time that he signed his quitclaim in July 1973.
Thus, since the terms and scope of the quitclaim are fully
controlling on the claim which PDDONOR/1 1s asserting,
have determined that the Agency has no legal obligation-
whatsoever to pay him the $20,000 which he seeks
Aš a final note, this Office recognizes that, not-
withstanding the absence of any legal obligations, the par-
ticularly sensitive status of PDDONOR/1 within CIA may
nevertheless give rise to an understandable desire in some
quarters to make the $20,000 payment to him on security
and/or moral grounds. We do not necessarily quarrel with
such a view, nor do we mean to imply that CIA is legally
precluded from, in effect, "waiving" the terms of the quit
claim if it so chooses. At the same time, it must be remem
bered that this Office was asked to prepare the quitclaim at
issue in 1973 precisely in anticipation of a situation such
as the one before us now. It is respectfully submitted that
such documents will cease to have any future efficacy or
credibility whatsoever if individuals such as PUDONOR/1 who
are ostensibly bound by them perceive a willingness on the
part of CIA to set aside these carefully worded and legally
binding documents whenever a claim (no matter how 111-
founded) is advanced. In short, we hope and trust that any
décision to pay PODONOR/1 the $20,000 at issue despite the
quitclaim and documented evidence to the contrary will be
based on truly compelling security or moral considerations.

1. (S) Referenced memorandum pertained to a formal roquest to amend
Subject's contract to provide authorization for specific operational expenses.
(S) Paragraph five (5) of Subject's current contract, among other
things, provided for "other expenses". It is our opinion that the intent
here was to provide authorization for expenditures for "Operational" purposes.
The language being goneral and non-restrictive in nature, it would follow
that any expenditure deemed by you, as the operating activity, to be of an
operational nature, and so authorized, would be within the framework of the
authorization and that there would be no need to specifically identify and
additionally authorize the item and/or its value. Accordingly no action
Is taken upon your request, it being presumed that you already have adequate
contractual authority.

•
2. Background: Because of the current wording in
paragraph 5 of BERTOTALLY's contract, C/PCS/CSS/B&F believes
that a reduction in BERTOTALLY's commuted rate entitlement
must be made when operational entertainment (meals) are
provided him by his case officer. This interpretation is
based on the present wording in the contract stating that
reimbursement for expenses will be in "substantial accordance
with CIA regulations." Since under CIA regulations a re-
duction in per diem is effected when meals are provided by
the Government, C/PCS/CSS/B&F believes the language of the
contract should be amended to permit operational entertainment
(meals) to be provided to Subject without resultant deduction
his commuted rate reimbursement-

Contract Amendment for
Bruce A. BERTOTALLY
Action Requested: It is requested that the contract
for Bruce A. BERTOTALLY, an Independent Contractor, be
amended retroactive to 1 June 1977 deleting the last sentence
of paragraph 3, concerning the taxability of operational
travel by his wife, of a previous amendment effective 1 June
1977. It is further requested that a one-time, payment of.
$1,404 to BERTOTALLY be authorized to offset the tax he is
required to pay on the $3,100 which represents his wife's
travel expenses on their last operational trip abroad, which
appeared on BERTOTALLY's W-2 form for 1977 as additional
taxable income.
2. Background: After CI Staff assumed responsibility
for BERTOTALLY in July 1976, based on requirements developed
by the field, he was asked if he would be willing to under-
take occasional operational trips abroad for the purpose of
briefing and lecturing friendly liaison services and other
high-level foreign officials. BERTOTALLY agreed, but was
adamant that he would only do so if the Agency would allow
his wife to accompany him not only for purposes of companion-
ship but also to enhance his security. Because this was his
condition to such overseas operational travel and because it
was felt her presence would contribute to his good morale,
effectiveness in the performance of his mission, and also
preclude his possibly creating potentially embarrassing
incidents for us and the host liaison services; Chief,

Contractor, be amended effective as of 1 January 1978
to pay him $50.00 per month for the use of his private

2. Background: When CI Staff assumed responsibility
for Mr. Rosnek in July 1976, we noted that the Office of
Security had an informal arrangement by which it reimbursed
Mr. Rosnek $50.00 per month for the use of his private
quarters as office space. It is now requested that this
arrangement be incorporated into Mr. Rosnek's contract.
On 7 February 1977 former Chief CI Staff agreed to
reimburse Mr. Rosnek for the interest payments on a car
which he purchased so that he would be ready and available
for work when we needed him. The monthly interest charge as
of December 1977 is slightly less than $39.00 and it is

CI Staff made a personal commitment to BERTOTALLY that
he could indeed have his wife accompany him on any
operational trips abroad, if he chose to have her do so,
and that her travel expenses would be borne by the Agency.
It was understood that her travel expenses would be limited
to the cost of her travel and per diem.
.
Subsequent to this agreement BERTOTALLY took three
separate trips abroad accompanied by his wife and one quick
trip to Mexico accompanied by his case officer. No problems
developed following the first two trips. Vouchers submitted
after each trip, claiming their joint costs as operational.
expenses, were honored without question. However, following
their last joint trip abroad her travel expenses of $3,100
were interpreted as additional taxable income. BERTOTALLY
considers this a violation of the commitment made to him.
and has demanded that the Agency pay him a sum
sum équivalent to
the additional Federal and state taxes he will have to pay
as a result of our unilateral decision on this matter.
$
Presently we already have three separate trips abroad
planned for BERTOTALLY during 1978. We are convinced that
unless we reimburse him for the $1,404 additional tax he
must pay for 1977 and assure him that his wife can accompany
him on future operational trips abroad at Agency expense
and without having such expenses declared as additional in-
come, he will refuse to go on any more trips abroad on our
behalf.

provide that subsequent augmentation of your basic fèe, based upon cost-of-living

The remuneration that he receives from the Agency is his
family's sole means of support. He was given cost-of-living
increases in the past and when CI Staff assumed responsibility
for him he was assured by the Chief, CI Staff that he would
continue to receive such increases in the future. In early
December 1977 he inquired why his pay did not already reflect
the 7.05 per cent increase given to Agency employees in October.
We believe it to be in the best interests of the US Government
to honor all commitments made to him and to assure that he
continues to identify himself positively with the Agency.

The amendment provides, that travel of subject's

provisions of HR 22-2a (18) (now in the process of

under the OGC ruling 77-1264, TDY travel for a

Deputy Director's discretion. It should be changed
to preclude any possible interpretation of which
would give rise to TDY junkets for wives and depen-

that subject is in fact an Independent Contractor,
the entire subject of dependents TDY travel is a
delicate issue, and because of this, we ask that

Attached is an amendment to Subject's contract increasing
his compensation from $23,750 to $25,250 per annum effective
1 March 1975. Withholding of North Carolina state tax should
be increased from $125 to $130 per month concurrent with the
effective date of this amendment. I trust it is not too late
to include the increase plus adjustment for March with his
April pay. Your assistance is appreciated as always.

Amendment to Contract for
George Martin Rosnek
Action Requested
It is requested that the contrac
or Mr.
Mr. George Martin Rosnek, an Independent Contractor,
amended to increase his compensation from $37,270 to $41,270
per annum cffective 8 April 1979
2. Background: In September 1978 Mr. Rosnek, a former
senior officer of the KGB, raised with his case officer the
question of prior financial commitments made to him by the
Agency. Specifically, he claimed that the Agency still owed
him $20,000 of an original commitment of $50,000 made to him
at the time of his defection. This $20,000 claim has become
an obsession with Mr. Rosnek and is likely to affect negatively
his relationship with the Agency unless resolved to his relative
satisfaction. Attached for background information are
1
: documents relating to Mr. Rosnek's claim.
1
3. After careful consideration of the equities involved
in this case it is my belief that security considerations
dictate that we settle Mr. Rosnek's claim in the following
manner. I will approve an increase in his annual payment by
$4,000 effective April 1979 (from $37,270 to $41,270).
Thereafter, his annual compensation would be increased each
October in the amount identical to the cost of living increase
given to US Government employees. (This cost of living pro-
vision is currently in his contract). However, at such time

careful review of the PDDONOR file substantiates
the fact that there were three unequivocal financial commit
ments made to PDDONOR at the time of his defection in
February 1964. These three commitments were:

He would be paid $25,000 for each of the two
years he cooperated in place. Total $50,000.
He would receive $10,000 for his part in
identifying William Vassal, a British
Admiralty employee as a KGB agent.
SARA
He would receive $25,000 per year salary
from the Agency.
2. The question at issue now is whether an additional
commitment was also made to PDDONOR to the effect that the
financial
Agency would prov assistance to him to purchase.

prior to his defection in a conversation with his case officer,

what he believes was a commitment on the part of the Agency
to provide him with financial assistance in the purchase of
a home. A memorandum dated 16 February 1970, written by
Mr. Bruce Solic describes this verbal exchange between PDDONOR
and his case officer. (See Reference A). In addition, a
memorandum dated 14 August 1972 also written by Mr. Solie
(Reference B) states that "Nosenko stated that prior to his
defection in Geneva, he discussed his future with Bagley and
made three requests, these being:
-
Employment at $25,000 per year;
$50,000 in savings account,
Assistance in purchasing a house.
2-2
According to Nosenko, Bagley, a day or two later, informed
Nosenko that his requests had been approved and Nozenko
considers this constituted a valid verbal contract
3. From PDDONOR's viewpoint therefore an additional
commitment, quite separate and apart from the three listed
in paragraph 1 was made to him. Consequently, he now argues
that a payment made to him in July 1970, in the amount of
$20,000 and which he used as a downpayment on a house, was
the fulfillment of this additional commitment and not part
of the $50,000 he was promised. for his two years in place.
This despite the fact that in the 14 August 1972 nemorandum
as Mr. Solic states in paragraph 5,
"Kosenko also
considers that the assistance in purchasing furniture,
house, etc., which he has been given since 1969 should be
considered as cancelling the matter of the $50,000.
What seems to have occurred is a change of position
on PDDONOR's part. While previously acknowledging that the
original $50,000 commitment had been met (paragraph 5 of
Reference B) PDDONOR now takes the position that of the
below listed payments only $30,000 should be applied against
the $50,000 commitment. The July 1970 payment of $20,000.
should be applied against a separate commitment to provide.
assistance in purchasing a home.
