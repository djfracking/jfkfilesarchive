b. After the 10 March 1952 coup d'etat,
Subject opposed the de facto government in
spite of his close relations with Dr. MORALES
del Castillo, who offered Subject the post of
Consulting Counsellor (Consejero Consultivo)
which post Subject rejected. Subject began to
conspire against the regime with Justo Carrillo
and Dr. Araujo, constituting the organization
called the Montecristi Group. Subject continues
to maintain a close relationship with Dr. Araujo,
now President of the Cuban Medical College,
Professor of the School of Medical Sciences of
Havana University, and functionary of the Higher
Nervous Activity Research Institute.
C.
After the 1 January 1959 Revolution,
Subject hastened to exploit the Communist con-
tent of the Revolution and participated directly
in the denunciation of Dr. Urrutia. One of
Urrutia's assistants was Subject's patient and
informed Subject of events occurring within the
Presidential Palace. Subject then consulted with
Raul Castro and denounced Dr. Urrutia as anti-
Communist.
d. Subject is very intelligent, very com-
petent, and an extraordinarily hard worker. He
is Professor of Psychology at the Havana University
Medical School, and Director of the Higher Nervous
Activity Research Institute. During the decade
1950-60, he held a high post within the Cuban
Medical College and was President of the World
Medical Group; during this decade he made many
visits to the USA on matters related to his pro-
fessional activities.
e.
It has been commented that Subject performed
"brain washing" activities for the Havana DSE.
During the period in 1966 that subsource was held
prisoner at Villa Marista, he did not sec Subject;
subsource has never heard anyone state that he
actually saw Subject at Villa Marista. In subsource's
opinion, if Subject has ever worked for the MININT,
it was probably as professor of psychology in classes
given to MININT personnel; subsource presumes that
the classes would have been similar to those that
Subject gave to Cuban artists.
f. In 1956, Subject acquired an extraordinarily
beautiful mistress that he still continues to visit
and support. This mistress, Manolita Canto, was
divorced by her husband, Salup (fnu), after a private
detective hired by the husband surprised Subject and
Canto in a hotel room in Miami, Florida; subsequently,
U.S. immigration authorities prohibited Subject from
entering the U.S.A. Canto had. had one son by her
husband; when her husband died, the son inherited
the father's wealth, which was considerable. The
laws against private property promulgated by the
Castro regime undermined Canto's economic position
to the point that she has had to go to work; she now
works at the INIT (National Tourist Industry Institute),
located at 23 and L Streets, Vedado, Havana City.

OSHA 25559
_
:
Subject surrendered his private practice to the Cuban
Government, and receives only his salary as Director
of the Higher Nervous Activity Research Institute,
which salary amounts to 800 Cuban pesos; this salary
is insufficient to permit Subject to maintain his
own home and his mistress's separate home and to lead
the type of life to which he was accustomed.
g. Subject is described as lacking in normal
affections, cold and calculating, a typical schizoiḍ
interested only in himself, never makes a friendly
gesture, has almost no friends." Subject is generally
disliked and has many enemies who feel real hate towards
him. The young Revolutionary medical doctors refuse
to have anything to do with him. Fidel Castro does
not know who Subject is and has certainly never been
treated by Subject or received psychiatric treatment
from any other psychiatrist. Subject must be very un- ·
happy and downcast at his present situation: His
income is insufficient forhis normal mode of life%;B
he no longer travels extensively abroad (formerly,
he traveled abroad every three months); he holds no
representative office; he is not politically or socially
prominent and, indeed, no one pays him the slightest
attention. Subsource states categorically that he
believes that "Dr. Bustamente would be willing to
accept any offer. He would take the bait if given
half a chance."
h. The trip that Subject made to the USSR in
the early 1960's was a "pleasure trip." So far as
subsource knows, Subject received no training in the
USSR..
i.
Subject is not known to have any relations
with SovBloc officials in Havana. He does maintain
close relations: with (Dr) * LOPEZ Sanchez (fnu), an
close relations, with
old-guard Communist of the so-called microfaction
who holds the post of Secretary of the Cuban Academy
S..
of Sciences. Cora of Soject of 201-1022.346
j. Fidel Castro is a pathological schizo-
paranoid reform-type personality, which personality
type is characterized by latent homosexuality.
k. Raul Castro is just the opposite of what he appears
to be and is more "human" than Fidel Castro; he has
'
founded a home, takes an interest in his family, etc.
He suffers from a homosexual complex, as denoted by his
hoarse voice.
1.
Armando Hart is a hysterical type who believes
that his wife dominates him. His wife suffers from
a complex based on the fact that she is much older than
he.

Nessage 107. Dear John. I received your 96.
:
I have known Doctor Jose Angel BUSTAMANTE O'Leary since
student days. He was always conspicuous in the assemblies of.
those days as boonging to the leftist sector. He graduated as
a medical doctor in 1939. Since then he virtually lived in the
medical school of Havana and in the National (medical School]
together with Doctor Jose LOPEZ Sanchez
(at present Secretary
of the Academy of Sciences, intelligent Communist and very dan-
gerous). They set to work to obtain positions in the
Nedical Commissions and representing the Medical College every
time there was a chance to go abroad. This brought about a
certain protest from the doctors who contributed to the funds of
the college and who met the costs of the trips, because the same
ones (Drs. BUSTAMANTE and LOPEZ Sanchez) went every time even
when the reasons for the trip had nothing to do with their medi-
cal specialities. This brought about the regulation of futur
trips, but by that time BUSTAMANTE and LOPEZ Sanchez had made
their contacts and had founded the Pan American Medical Confedera
SECRET
tion (C.H.P.) with headquarters in Havana. This confederation
vas made up of the National Medical Associations rpt National

Modical Associations, that is to say, the Pan American Medical
7 Colleges, among these the Cuban Medical College. They then
occupied positions in the Central Executive Committee.
Lator
there were established four zones of the C.H.P. with BUSTAMANTE
occupying the position of president and Dr. LOPEZ Sanchez the
office of treasurer, leaving the secretariat open on a rotating
basis for an executive of the National Medical College who
might be useful to them in their manipulations. Thus in Septem-
ber of 1955 they managed to have the National Hedical College
of the periodical
sponsor the publication of the C.N.P. They maintained them-
solves in their respective offices up to the present year,
alternating the secretary whenever the executive committee of
the National Medical College was changed. The periodical of the
C.M.P. was published until the dissolution of the National
Nedical College. When the Revolutionary Medical College was
founded they were able to install as secretary of the C.M.P. for
the Caribbean Zone Dr. Leopoldo E. ARAUJO Pernal who is mani-
pulated by BUSTAMANTE as a puppet to serve his ends. When it was
learned that a movement was afoot in the Executive Central
Committee of the C.M.P. to expell Cuba---this being pushed by
the medical associations of the other latin American Republics
BUSTAMANTE advised the government to dissolve the Cuban Nedical
Association, using Dr. ARAUJO as President P.S. (sic.) of the

from the C.M.P. [by dissolving their organization] thus
avoiding the possibility of the C.H.P. voting for expulsion rpt

to exit. The dissolution took place on 30 April of last year

two; now Professor of Nervous and Mental Disorders at the
University of Havana. He has Dr. ARAUJO as professorial assis
tant, three; Director of the Institute of Psychiatry, another
bureaucratic institute in which his protege Dr. ARAUJO also
bas a position, four; he does not like publicity, serving behind
the scenes as advisor to those who appear in public, five;
he does not help anyone disinterestedly but neither does he
hurt anyone, six; he always has, and up to the present, lived
well during all of the administrations of the Medical College
and through the various governments. For this reason he is
called the "man of cork" because he always remains afloat.
Public opinion holds that he supplies drugs to the G-2 to make
the prisoners talk and that he is director of all this type of
work, but I have been unable to confirm this personally. I
will continue this topic in my next message because I am afraid
that another sheet of paper will be too bulky for one letter.

In February or March 1967, Beato sent (Dr) Augusto
✗*FERNANDEZ- Conde, employed at Florida State Hospital, Chattahoochee
Florida, U.S.A. a copy of the magazine Tribuna Medica (Medical
Tribune); which contains a complete list of all the "professionals"
(presumably medical doctors) remaining in Cuba and all those who
have left Cuba. Dr. Fernandez acknowledged receipt of the magazinė
Dr. Fernandez was the last President of the National Medical
College of Cuba, dissolved by Fidel Castro in April 1966.
-
3. In January or February 1967, Beato learned from medical
files, the complete list of all the Cuban medical doctors who had
taken the Foreign Board examinations in Florida, U.S.A., together
with the grades received. This also "appeared in the School of
Medicine, Havana University". The examinations are highly con-
fidential and it is inexplicable how such private information
could be published in Cuba. Medical doctors in Cuba presume that
"said organization must be infiltrated by Communists" who pirated
the information and forwarded it to Cuba.

en donde desempeñó diversos cargos, pudo conocer ampliamente el desarrollo
de la medicina en Cuba hasta el 30 de Abril de 1967, es decir ha podido co-
nocer también el desenvolvimiento de la medicina cubana durante el régimen
castro-comunista. Siendo lo que a continuación expreso un enjuiciamiento
del mismo en su triple aspecto docente, profesional y clasista.
Aspecto docente.
La Universidad de la Habana fué fundada en el año 1728 y fueron precisamente
los estudios médicos los primeros en ser organizados como Facultad. Si ol pa-
sado puede venagloriarse de haber sido cuna de dos nombres preclaros en la His-
toria de la Medicina, como son Tomás ROMAY, sabio introductor de la vacuna er.
Cuba y el Dr. Carlos J. FIKLAY, genial descubridor del agente transmisor de la
fiebre amarilla, En la época republicana adquirió justa fama por la calidad də
sus profesores, la rigidez de sus planes de estudio y la brillantez de sus Ta-
duados. Pero no es el momento de citar nombres que justifiquen tales asevera-
ciones. Basta decir tan solo que la Facultad de Medicina, precisamente, estaba
clasificada como A-1 en el ranking de las facultades similares del mundo entero,
al igual que las mejores universidades de los Estados Unidos de América.
Con el advenimiento del régimen comunista de Fidel CASTRO, comenzó la dəsintegra-
ción de la Universidad de la Habana, para volverla a integrar, como una rueda más
en·le inmensa maquinaria comunista del Gobierno. Siendo precisamente Facultad
de Medicina la primera en ser atacada, alegando diversos pretextos de indole se-
cundaria, lo que trajo como consecuencia la renuncia de la mejor parte de su pro-
fesorado. Con la emigración de los médicos cubanos casi en masa, que repudiaban
el régimen totalitario y tiránico que se instauraba en la Isla, agudizándose la
carencia de profesores en la Facultad de Medicina.
Modo de resolver este grave problema que se le creaba al régimen de Castro.
En primer lugar nombrando profesores de "dedo", es decir que nunca hicier in-
guna prueba de capacidad para adquirir sus cátedras, sino que deben au nomaramics,
to por ser militantes comunistas o por la orclusiva voluntad del Rector o Bocaneg

En algunas asignaturas no existen las pruebas de capacidad generalmente acep-
tadas por todas las universidades del mundo, es decir el exámen, bien de tipo
u otro. Pues en el afán de graduar médicos con el fin de poder reemplazar inu-
tilmente a la gran masa de profesionales emigrados, las notas se dan por simple
asistencia a clases, hay que graduar médicos a toda costa, dicen los dirigentes
comunistas y para que se vea hasta donde llegan en este sentido, vaya la siguier:
te anécdota vivida por el Dr. BEATO, la cual refleja con exactitud esta gran
preocupación de los jerarcas del régimen. Se trata de un antiguo alumno de la
época pre-comunista, que cuando CASTRO se apodera del poder, le faltaban pocas
asignaturas para graduarse de médico. Como es un cubano demócrata, aprobó to-
das menos una, que no quiso examinar, para no coger el título de médico bajo el
régimen comunista, cosa que repugnaba a su conciencia, pero cuando los dirigente:
de su curso le apremiaron para que se examinara, so pena de ser expulsado si no
lo hacia, no tuvo más remedio que hacerlo, pero buscó adrede el suspenso, con-
testando mal la casi totalidad del exámen, a pesar de esto, y de hacer malisi-
mamente el exámen, fué aprobado. He aquí la nueva versión del castro-comunista,
de hacer médicos a palos.
En el plan de estudios médicos, existe una asignatura "Marxismo" que es indis-
pensable para continuar la carrera. El alumno que no posea el aprobado en la
misma, jamás será médico, no importa que sea brillante on Patología o Terapéuti-
ca, jamás obtendrá el título mientras no se haga un alumno aventajado en esa
asignatura. Así que lo que se quiere obtener por el régimen es un tipo de mé-
dico político, que responda siempre a las orientaciones de la dirigencia comu-
nista y no a los cánones sagrados del clásico arte de curar.
Todas estas cosas han dado origen a un tipo especial de médico, que el pueblo
cubano le ha dado a la broma y la conocen con la denominación genérica de "oin-
co picos", porque la prueba final, la gran prueba, la que los consagra ante lou
‹ ojos de los jerarcas comunistas es "La subida durante cinco vocès al Pico Tur-

un plumazo, todas nuestras reivindicaciones, muchas de las cuales estaban
regadas con la sangre y el sacrificio de muchos de nosotros. En su lugar
existe hoy en día un régimen de trabajo esclavo, que no admite méritos y
capacidad en el orden profesional, sino una ciega obediencia a los princi-
pios Marxista-Leninista. Habiéndome enterado por amigos colegas de la pro-
fesión, de que en el mes de Enero o Febrero de 1967, apareció en la escuela
actual de Medicina una lista completa de todos los médicos cubanos que han
tomado el Foreign-Board en Florida, U.S.A. y sus correspondientes calificacion
"esconociendo como una cosa tan privada ha sido posible de que se pudiet
se publicar en Cuba, siendo las causas de que entre el sector médico, exista
el recelo de hablar al ver que cosas confidenciales como son esos exámenes,
puedan ser publicadas en Cuba, por lo que se piensa en la infiltración comu-
nista dentro de dicho organismo.

▲ mediados del mes de Marzo de 1967, cuando me dirigia al Archivo Nacional,
el cual se encuentra ubicado en la Calle de Compostela y San Isidro en la Ha-
bana, para realizar estudios de investigaciones históricas de la Medicina gu-
bana, adonde todos los días solía ir, pues en uno de esos días al salir de di-
¨ cho Archivo Nacional y tratar de tomar la Ave. del Puerto para ir al british
Club, que se encuentra en Prado, pude observar de que dicha Ave. estuvo inte-
rrumpida al tránsito durante varios días, no recuerdo dias exacto, pero si sé
que un solo dia extremaron la vigilancia en el puerto, además de no permitir
que se acercase nadio, logrando ver desde los muelles de la Terminal del Ferry
Habana-Cayo Hueso y a una distancia de unos 50 a 100 mts. camiones y rustras
cargando objetos de toda clase de tamaños, éstos objetos eran de madera y pue-
do decir de que un modelo de las cajas de madera era de unos 12 mts. de largo
por unos 2 mts. de ancho, no recordando el alto de la misma, así como las me-

métodos de exploración radiológicas, como son las colecistografias y pie-
lografias, son muy difíciles de hacer por la falta de los medios de cons
traste adecuados.
Las consultas privadas están llamadas a desaparecer en el régimen comunista
según ya proclaman a todos los vientos, los jerarcas del gobierno y por una
razón muy sencilla; porque, las consideran centros de competencia a la medi-
cina oficial, pues todavia el médico privado a pesar de todos los obstáculos
se esfuerza en dar al paciente una medicina de calidad superior a la que ea-
te encuentra en los Centros Hospitalarios y asistenciales del Régimen.
Aspecto clasista:
Los médicos cubanos, como clase habían llegado a una organización modelo an
su género, que fué copiada y sirvió para organizarse a muchas instituciones
similares de otros países, tal era el Colegio Médico Nacional (antigua ĉeje-
ración Médica de Cuba) que agrupaba hacie el año 1959 unos 7,000 médicos ou-
banos. Así como bajo su actuación se obtuvieron una serie de conquistas la-
borales y un ansiado Retiro Médico para la hora del descanso y de la vejez.
Habia un Código de Moral Médica y funcionaba dentro del Colegio, una serie de
Tribunales de Disciplina, que valaban por el estricto cumplimiento médico, es
decir agrupaciones con criterios disimiles en cuanto a la orientación de la
medicina como clase, independientes de todo lo que significara militancia ao-
tiva dentro de la politica nacional. La dirigencia colegial se elegía a tra-
vés de elecciones democráticas, en las que participan todos los médicos, re-
partiéndose los puestos ejecutivos de acuerdo con la representación proporcio-
nal de cada partido. Es decir que como en toda organización democrática, ha-
bia una mayoria que gobernaba y una minoría alerta y vigilante a cualquier
transgresión de las leyes colegiales.
Todo esto ha despparecido desde el mes de Abril de 1966, en que el régimen de
Fidel CASTRO declaró disuelto el Colegio Lédico Nacional y extinguida tojusi

quino", la montaña más alta de la Isla. Esto que parece escapado de la wen-
te de un alienado es lo que exige CASTRO, para que un médico se gradúe, no
importa que el alumno tenga una gran vocación por los estudios médicos, no
importa que haya demostrado su capacidad en la materia que son propias de la
Medicina, si no tiene aptitudes de alpinista o no quiere hacer la gran esca-
lada, no se gradua y no obtiene el título. Por estas razones, se podrá ob-
servar del temor casi sagrado con que son mirados estos médicos denominados
"cinco piccs" por la población cubana, que con razón los desprecia y que jus-
tificadamente rebusa tenazmente todos sus servicios.
Aspecto Profesional:

"
'
El ejercicio de la medicina es hoy una pesadilla para los médicos que tengan
la desgracia de permanecer todavía en Cuba. No hablo, claro, está, de los mé-
dicos integrados al Partido Comunista Cubano, los cuales gozan de todos los pri-
vilegios y prerrogativas de la "nueva clase" sino del resto de la gran masa mé-
dica que aúm vive en Cuba, cuyo 90% abandonaría el pais si tuviera oportunidad
para hacerlo.
i
Cuando un médico pide permiso para irse de Cuba, lo tiene que hacer ante un fun-
cionario del Ministerio de Salud Pública, un tal Capitán FOLS, quien despacha
los martes en los salones del antiguo Colegio Nédico Nacional (hoy desaparecidoj.
Teniendo que presentar la solicitud por escrito, y entonces dicho funcionario
se la firma y la declara tranquilamente que tiene que esperar un año después
de la fecha de la solicitud. Inmediatamente comienzan las represalias por pɛl-
te del régimen, rebaja de categorias, traslado de empleos, cierres y confisca-
ción de consultas, etc. es decir todo lo imaginable para que el médico cambie
de opinión al sentir todo el rigor del gobierno esclavista que sufrimos actual-
mente en Cuba. Hay que decir con orgullo que son muy raros, rarisimos, los ca-
sos que renuncian a la salina del país, pues con moral altísima, la inmensa Bɛ-
yoría de los médicos soportan con dignidad toda esa clase de vojaciones, (para

poder obtener algún día la ansiada lilertad.
Los que trabajan en alguna dependencia del Estado, y hoy en día todos los
servicios médicos en su enorme totalidad, están bajo el control del Estado,
se encuentran sujetos a una disciplina despótica que anula toda independencia
personal, tan propia del ejercicio de la más liberales de toda las profesionen
como es la Medicina. Se le controla lo que receta, el número de indicaciones
que hace, los análisis que prescribe, tiene que cumpli su trabajo bajo un
horario estricto, como cualquier burócrata secundario, y lo que es peor, está
sujetɔ a la vigilancia no tan sobo de sus colegas directores de la Institución
sino también de los llamados Comités de Vigilancia y de las Secciones del Far-
tido Comunista, encargadas de supervisar las funciones todas de la institución
y que llaman inmediatamente al profesional "al orden" ante cualquier aspira-
ción de quebrantamiento y que incluso lo juzgan ante Asamblea de todos los tra-
bajadores, médicos y no médicos.
Las medicinas son pocas y malas, el Ministerio de Salud Pública, envia a todos
los profesionales cada dos meses, una listica cada vez menguante, de los medi-
camentos que pueden obtenerse y que contados por el entrevistado no pasan dé
700 productos. El avance de la Terapéutica, que día a día está registrado par
la prensa médica mundial, no se conoce en Cuba, cuyos médicos se ven obligados
.a recetar medicinas ya en desuso en los países avanzados del orbe. Productos
de uso general y obligado en la práctica moderna, como el Acth y los derivador.
corticosteroides, escasean frecuentemente y en esos casos, cuando el paciente
de clientela particular va a comprarlos a una botica, por necesitarlos urgente-
mente, se le contesta que no las hay y que están a nivel de Hospitales.

autoridades comunistas cubanas que dirigen la salud pública. En segundo lugar,
importanio profesionales extranjeros de Faises Comunistas o Socialistas, o bien
de Países Democráticos, pero que son militantes o simpatizantes ocultos de loa
partidos comunistas locales. Todos estos profesionales son habilitados immedia-
tamente, incluso para ejercer la profesión médica, por un simple decreto recto-
ral.
Así como un examen imparcial de este profesorado, nos permite afirmar su baja
calidad, y por una razón muy sencilla; por ser todos con rarisimas excepciones
"profesores improvisados, sin ninguna historia o experiencia médica-pedagógion.
Y aquellos rarisimos, repetimos, que pueden poseer alguna, por haber sido ante-
tiormente profesores de la facultad, no tienen la libertad de enseñanza propia
del carácter liberal de la Medicina, sino que están sujetos a la férrea discipli-
na colectiva propia de los sistemas marxistas-leninistas.
Del alumnado puede decirse sin exageración alguna, que es el más malo en la larga
historia de la ya bi-centenaria Universidad de la Habana. Como lo qué se quiere
obtener es un tipo de médico político, ciego observante de las reglas comunistas
poco importa la preparación médica de los alumnos. Si antiguamente se requerian
7 años de Escuela Primaria y 4 o 5 de Bachillerato, hoy cualquiera, con un simple
exámen, las más de las veces azañado, puede hacer su ingreso en los estudios mé-
dicos sin haber cursɛdo ningún tipo de preparación en la Primera o Segu da Enser-
ñanza, lo que si se exige es una militancia activa dentro de los cuadros uel Per
tido Comunista Cutano, es decir, que no estudia en la Facultad de Medicina, el que
quiere o tiene vocación por estos estudios, para ello hay que demostrar de un modo
fehaciente la vinculación al régimen. Y cuando se tiene sospecha de uns via ad-
hesión por cualquiera de los alumnos, inmediatamente se celebra una "Asamblea de
depuración", en la que 99 veces de cada 100 es expulsado aquel que tenga la mala
suerte de ser señalado por sus compañeros, en definitiva, que la clásica y consa-
grada libertad de enseñanza es un sito en el régimen comunista cucano.

17 January 19NS
Dr. Jose Angel BUSTAMANTE O'Leary: Background Information/
Professional and Personality Evaluation
1. On 12 January 1966, our representative called on Dr. Augusto
Fernandez-Conde at his office in the Florida State Hospital, Chattahoochee,
Florida, and discussed the requirements of Case 46,632 with him. He has most
cooperative, have his wholehearted attention to the subjects for discussion,
and provided a considerable amount of pertinent information.
i
2. Dr. Fernandez-Conde has know Dr. Jose Angel Bustamante O'Leary since
their undergraduate days in the late 1930's at the Facultad de Medicina, Uni-
versity of Havana. After Bustamante's graduation in 1939 and Fernandez-Conde's
graduation in 1940, their professional contacts still continued although their
political persuasions were quite different. From 1953 or 1960 to August 1961,
Fernandez-Conde had little or no contact with Bustamante, and since August/1961,
when he left Cuba for permanent residence in the US, Fermande>-Conde has had no
first-hand knowledge of Bustamante's activities. The information which he pro-
vided on Bustamante is presented below and is dated between the late 1930's and
1859/1360.
3. Dr. Bustamante was born about 1911 in Havana and has lived there all
of his life. He never knew his father. He made his home with his so-called
aunt, who was locally belleved to be his natural mother. His aunt is no longer
Ilving. The uncertainty about his ancestry has constantly plagued Bustamante,
and Dr. Fernandez-Conde suggests that it may be one of the motivation factors
In his personality.
•
4. Dr. Bustamante is married to the former Maria Luisa Rodriquez-Columble,
a native of Barracoa, Cuba. It is commonly believed that Maria Luisa is part
Negro. Lending credence to this statement is the fact that Maria Luisa kept her
nother completely in the background and never brought her to Havana where she
I would have become known to Maria Luisa's and Jose's friends. Dr. Fernandez-Conde.
suggests that Maria Luisa's excessive concern over her antecedents probably moti-
vates her aggressiveness. In seeking high social position in the community. Her
brother is Dr. /fny/ Rodriquez-Columble, a child psychiatrist, who is a well-
known homosexual.
5. Dr. and Mrs. Bustamante have two children, both of whom have been
enrolled in the best Roman Catholic private schools in Havana. Their daughter
is now about 18 years old and is described as being a pretty, healthy teenaŋer.
Their son, Jose, Jr., is about 19 or 20 years of age and is very effeminate in
manner. Dr. Bustamante is known to have been worried about his son's personality
problems when the boy was nine years old and his classmates taunted him as being
a sissy. In the intervening years, Jose, Jr. has become a homosexual and has
been under the psychiatric care of, first, his father, who was not successful in
treating him, and more recently of Dr. Carlos Acosta-Hodal and of Dr. [fnu/
Sorsegui (now deceased). "On many occasions, Dr. Bustamante complained to our

Additional Information Dr. Jose Angel Bustamante O'Leary
Ę.
:
1. Dr. Augusto Fernandez-Conde promised to furnish additional details
In an effort to complete the Information, which he had already supplied on
Dr. Bustamante and which was presented for your consideration in NO-16-66 of
17 January 1966. He has now reported to us the following results of his efforts
thus far.
2. In paragraph #15 of HO-16-66, Dr. Fernandez-Conde mentioned that in
1360 Dr. Bustamante had deposited money and some of his wife's jewels in a
repository in Mexico City for safekeeping. He further recalls that on another
occasion Bustamante arranged for a friend to take another sum of money and more
Jevelry to Mexico City and to deposit them there. Eliseo Perez-Stable, M.D.,
Veterans Administration Hospital, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15240, is reported
to know the identity of Bustamante's friend who transported the money and
Jewelry to Mexico City for safekeeping and possibly might know more about the
size of Bustamante's deposits abroad.
3. In paragraphs #3, 13, and 18 f of NO-16-66, our informant touched on
the brainwashing techniques which Dr. Bustamante employed on certain individuals
detained at the G-2 prison in Havana. He suggests that Oscar Sagredo, M.D.,
whose current address is Rodriguez Sampedro 10, Hadrid 15, Spain, was well
acquainted with Dr. Bustamante's professional methods and particularly with his
brainwashing techniques. Dr. Sagredo was formerly one of Cuba's outstanding
psychiatrists. After leaving Havana, he was employed as Professor of Psychology
at Temple University in Philadelphia and later moved to Madrid to reside.
4. In paragraph #18 c of NO-16-66, Dr. Fernandez-Conde named Dr. Scarizza
as the Individual who psychoanalyzed Dr. Bustamante. His full name is Spartaco
Scarizza, M.D., and his current address is Via Ammannat1.61, Rome, Italy..
5. Dr. Fernandez-Conde recently received a letter dated 13 January 16
from his good friend, Dr. Gunnar Gundersen, Gundersen Clinic, La Crosse,
Wisconsin, in which the latter asked him the following:
"Sometime I wish you would write ma in regard to our mutual adversary, Jose Angel
Bustamante-O'Leary. I presume he might be one of Castro's henchmen if someone
hasn't taken a pot shot at him which might have resulted in his liquidation.
Even that would have been too good for him in my judgment!"
6. According to Dr. Fernandez-Conde, Dr. Gundersen was formerly President
of the American Medical Association as well as President of the Council of the
World Medical Association. Bustamante was a member of the Council during
Dr. Gundersen's administration. Our source suggests that Dr. Gunderson should
have accurate information about Bustamante's reactions and attitudes.
7. We shall pass on the remaining Information promised in paragraph #19
of NB-16-66 as soon as It is received from Dr. Fernandez-Conde.

Mrs, Alvarez-Tablo, the one in which he was involved between 1951 and 1360
(and possibly later) brought him the greatest amount of notoriety. Unfortu-
nately, Dr. Fernandez-Conde cannot recall the name of this mistress. On one
occasion, Dr. Bustamante and his Inamorata registered as man and wife in a.
New York City hotel. The lady's husband got wind of their whereabouts, had
private detectives to obtain compromising photographs, and precipitated.
Dr. Bustamante's local arrest and detention on several charges. The latter put
up ball, but subsequently fled the US before the case came to trial. When he

1360 and possibly later. She is reported to have become a "mental case."
7. During the course of this latter affair, Jose, Sr. and Maria Luisa
on a few occasions came almost to the point of divorce. "But, by then he had
become a man of some importance in the Castro regime and for appearances' sake
they remained together. As recently as 1960, Maria Luisa spoke vehemently
against Jose, Sr. In private, while in public she tried to make it appear that
all was well in their manage. Dr. Fernandez-Conde has no first-hand knowledge
of Dr. Bustamante's extramarital affairs since 1360/1961. From refugees who
left Cuba in recent years, however, he learned that Dr. and Mrs. Bustamante
still live in their large residence in Miramar, located on 12th Street between
First and Third Avenue, Havana.

17 January 1966
12. Dr. Bustamante's actions during the Batista regime, are of Interest.
Batista's mother-in-law (the mother of his third wife, Marta Fernandez de Batista)
worked in some capacity for Maria Luisa Rodriguez Columble de Bustamante about
this time and, on the surface, the Batista and Bustamante families we're on
friendly terms. However, in reality, Jose, Sr. was working against Batista as
a member of the underground group, Monte Cristo, headed by the well-known
Justo Carrillo. At the same time, he maintained contact with the Communist
Party and is known to have had private_meetings on a continuing basis during the
Batista regime with Carlos Font, now /1066/ Vice Minister of Health, and Jose
Lopez Sanchez, current Vice President of the Cuban Academy of Sciences.
13. When Fidel Castro came to power, Bustamante's potential was brought
to the attention of Raul Castro. He offered to take charge of the brainwashing
activities of the G-2 and thus put into practice the techniques he had learned
from Kira-Lopez. He was subsequently put in charge of such work and was assisted
in it by Drs. Acosta-Hodal and Soracgul. After Dr. Soraegui's death, Raul Castro
went to the latter's office and supervised the removal of patients' files, obvi-
ously for future use in building up dossiers on the subjects.
14. Dr. Fernandez-Conde pointed out that, also after the Castro take-
over, Bustamante wanted to be made Director of the Mental Hospital in Mazorra,
eight miles outside of Havana. The position was given instead to Dr. Ordaz,
who had fought with Castro In the Sterra Maestra. At first, Bustamante com-
plained bitterly about losing out, but since then he has not asked for or
otherwise sought another similar Important professional post. Dr. Fernandez-
Conde suggests that Bustamante most probably has been told that he is performing
an Important military service for the regime and therefore it would be wise for
him to remain in the background. He further states that Bustamante is believed
to exert a considerable amount of Influence. In the Ministry of Health, although
he holds no official position in It. It should be noted that Bustamante's
Importance in the regime, however great, stems principally from his usefulness
to Raul Castro. Bustamante is currently 1966/ considered to be one of the 10
most effective enemies in the regime of the non-Communist Cuban doctors..
15. Dr. Bustamante is not believed to be in any sort of financial
trouble. As his professional stature grew and his wealth increased, he and his
wife soon acquired a taste for a luxurious way of life. They bought a pre-
tentious home in an exclusive residential section of Havana, bought a Cadillac,
and enrolled their children in select; private schools. They both are driven
by Ambitions for social prestige and high political position. They crave money
and power, want to be associated with those at the highest echelon in the regime,
and, above all, are opportunists of the first water. Maria Luisa has always.

injecting them with centotal [Sodium pentathol.] This practice was
carried out by Dr Jose Bustamante, a well known Cuban psychiatrist.
He maintained an office in a large house [exact location and

his office for the private practice of psychiatry in K Street, batween 17th
and 19th Streets, Vedado, Havana. Our Informant agrees with your statement
that Dr. Bustamante is currently considered to be the outstanding psychiatrist
In Cuba. Dr. Bustamante speaks English fairly wall and French to a limited
extent. It is significant that in 1959 he was farsighted enough to begin
lessons in Russian. Our informant has no knowledge of Bustamante's progress
or current proficiency in that language.
:
Dr. Bustamante was a close friend of Dr. Emilio Hira-Lopez, who is
now [1366/ reported to be practicing psychiatry in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Mira-
Lopez was born in Catalonia, Spain, and is believed to be a Spanish national.
During the Spanish Civil War, he was engaged in brainwashing prisoners and,
at the conclusion of hostilities, he had to leave the country. He apparently
proceeded to Cuba where he met Bustamante and subsequently exerted a profound
professional influence on him. He is known to have trained Bustamante in the
brainwashing techniques which he had used with prisoners during the Spanish
Civil War. According to Dr. Fernandez-Conde, Dr. Mira Lopez is a despicable,
loathsome person and exerted an evil influence on Bustamante.
10.
Dr. Bustamante's first public affiliation with Communist groups
was as a member of the Liga Da Juventud Comunista between 1931 and 1939. He
was also a member of the Ala Izquierda, a medical leftist group, and he was
President of the Federacion Estudiantil Universitaria. By the time he had
graduated from the University in 1933, he was believed to have been in agree-
ment with the purposes of the Communist Party although he may not have been a
party member. Later, he was for a while a member of the Accion Inmediata
(founded in December 1938), a political group in the medical profession which
was not Communist. In 1946, he was one of the founders of the Confederacion
Medica Panamericana, which still exists (1966), and in 1950, after the Castro
takeover, he founded another political party in the medical profession, the
Partido Medico de la Revolucion.
'
11. During the 1940's and the 1950's, Dr. Bustamante gradually became
well known in the medical profession and achieved some measure of affluence.
In 1943, he held an office in the Colegio Medico Nacional de Cuba and In 1952-
1953 he served as President of this organization. About 1954, Dr. Bustamante
asked permission of the Colegio Medico Nacional de Cuba to become a member of
Nanigo so that he could study and evaluate its Influence on the Negro, culture
in Cuba. The Nanigo is a secret Negro society in Cuba, which practices witch-
craft, offers human sacrifices, and indulges in other activities repugnant to
Western civilization. Permission was granted because of the allegedly scien
tific nature of Bustamante's interests. Some time later, Professor Federico
Sotolongo, who is still 1966/ a member of the medical faculty of the University
of Havana, told another doctor in the Colegio Medico Nacional de Cuba that
Bustamante was doing a good job of infiltrating the Manigo. Since Sotolon jo is
a Communist, the Inference was that Bustamante's performance benefited the
Communist Party. Dr. Fernandez-Conde stated that he needed no further evidence
that Bustamante was a trusted member of the Communist Party. Moreover, he is a
very good friend of the Chilean Communist Salvador Allende. Allende always
stayed in the Bustamante home when he visited Havana.

that in 1960, while on a trip to Montreal for a medical meeting, Dr. Bustamante
took a large sum of money and his wife's jewels with him and deposited them in
safekeeping somewhere in Mexico. The source of this particular Information is
Dr. Hector Weltz, a former close friend and confidant of Bustamante. Dr. Woltz
still lives in Cuba and is described as being anti-Castro.
-
16. Dr. Fernandez-Conde states that Bustamante Is Intelligent, Industri-
ous, well-grounded in his profession, gregarious, able to make and carry out
decisions, but is not a particularly forceful person. He is insincere, devious,
a physical coward, and Inordinately afraid when his life is in danger. He has
many personality complexes. He seldom drinks and boasts about his abstemiousness:
where liquor is concerned. He may occasionally drink a glass of port or vermouth
If the situation demands It. Marlo Luisa drinks but not to excess. Neither is
addicted to dope. Haria Luisa's Achilles heel is her overprotective attitude
towards her son, Jose, Jr. Both Dr. and Mrs. Bustamante are opportunists, love
money and power, and will go along with the regime so long as it serves their
best interests to do so. They have already taken the precaution of depositing
cash and valuables abroad to use In the event of the overthrow of the Castro
government and the need for them to flee Cuba. Very little exact information
is available about the state of Maria Luisa's health. Jose, Sr. is described.
es being in good health. He suffers continually from flat feet and is known to
have undergone a hemorrhoidectomy in the distant past...
17. Dr. Bustamante has only three close friends in Cuba. They are all
Communists. They are the following Individuals:
a. Dr. Leopoldo Araulo-Bernal, President of the Colegio Medico Nacional de
Cuba, Havana,
b... Dr. Carlos Acosta-Hodal, practicing psychiatrist in Havana
C. Dr. Oscar Garcia Fernando, practicing physician in Havana.
Almost all of the doctors left in Cuba are ant 1-Communist and are violently
opposed to Bustamante. The following two such individuals would be able to
provide detailed background Information on Bustamante:
-
Dr. Raul de Velasco Guzman, former President of the Colegio Medico Nacional
de Cuba (1956-1959), 3rd Avenue between 10th and 12th Streets, Miramar,
Havana. Dr. de Velasco has a sister and a son (Raul) now In Miami. Raul, Jr.
Is in his third year in the Medical School of the University of Miami.
b. Dr. Jorge Beato, Paseo Street and 17th Street, Vedado, lavana.
18. Dr. Fernandez-Conde suggests that the following Individuals should
be able to provide vital Information on Dr.. Bustamante or Mrs. Bustamantə. with
one exception, they are now living in the US.
Dr. Fidel Aguirre, 730 Livingstone Road, Elizabeth, New Jersey, telephone
-289-9000. Dr. Aguirre was formerly President of the Havana Medical Associ-

lived in Cuba, but now practices psychiatry in Rome. During his residence
in Cuba, he was the analyst. used to psychoanalyze those Cuban nedical
students who expected to specialize in psychiatry. He had Dr. Bustamante
under analysis for more than a year and therefore should have unique insight
into this patient's personality problems. Dr. Scarlzza on several occasions
mentioned to Dr. Fernandez-Conde how much trouble he was having with
Bustamante during his analysts. Bustamante frequently missed their sessions
of treatment although he always paid for the professional sarvices.
1. Mr. and Mrs. Enrique Leon, New York City. Mr. Leon is a lawyer and now [19667
works in the New York office of Julio Lobo, who was so prominent in the
business life of Cuba before the Castro regime. Mrs. Leon is the former
Rosario Rexach. Mr. and Mrs. Leon were probably the closest friends
Bustamante had before 1959/1960. They were members with him of the Ala
Izquierda and she was a former President of the Liceo. They are no longer
Communists. They left Cuba in early 1960 for permanent residence in the US.

Bustamante's extramarital affairs, and their effect on Maria Luisa's life.
A Cuban national who left Cuba in late 1961 for permanent residence in the
US. Dr. Fernandez-Conde cannot recall his name, but will obtain his name
and address from one of his friends in the US. This Individual was believed
to have been a member of the underground movement in Cuba and in March 1961
he was Interrogated by Bustamante in a series of interviews at the G-2

describe Bustamante's performance in this capacity.
19. Dr. Fernandez-Conde will be very glad to clarify any statements in
his discussion of Dr. Bustamante or to amplify them if requested. In addition,
he promises to obtain the current street address of Mr. and Mrs. Leon, the name
and address of the individual who was brainwashed, by Bustamante, and possibly
Dr. Scarizza's first name and street address in Rome. We will forward this
information as it is received.

useful reports since early 1962, from CC-3524, Ramon Alberto
Mendoza Gandarilla, a Cuban refugee and former resident of
Havana City who left Cuba on 22 January 1968. Source studied
medicine at Havana University until September 1966. when he
completed his fifth year before abandoning his studies; from
Sept 1967 to January 1968, he worked as a translator of medical
texts at the National Information Center for Medical Licenses,
23 and N Streets, Vedado, Havana City. He visited twice the
main building of the National Center for Scientific Research
(CNIC), the second time in mid-July 1966. Paragraphs 8. 11
and 14 from Elizado Maso Marcoleta, who had worked with Dr.
Mora and was familiar with "all of the research projects of
the CNIC." Paragraph 9 from Carlos J.. Finlay's brother, Miguel
Finlay, with whom source spoke in mid-January 1968. Paragraph

These institutes include the Institutes of Endocrinology,
Nephrology, Hematology, Gastroenterology, Neurology and Neuro-
surgery, Physiopathology, Psychology and Neurophysiology,
Hygiene and Epidemiology, Cardiology and Cardiovascular Surgery,
Nicrobiology and Virology, Angiology, and Parasitology.)
2. The National Center for Scientific Research (Centro
Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas, CNIC) is located in
Reparto Siboney (formerly Country Club), Marianao, Havana Pro-
vince, next to the Victoria de Giron premedical school (formerly
Colegio Sagrado Corazon), and occupies several impressive new
buildings; in addition, large private homes in the area have
been equipped as laboratories and residences for CNIC personnel.
As of mid-November 1967, some of the residences were occupied by
foreign scientists.
3. The CNIC is an autonomous organization controlled by
the Office of the Prime Minister, through which its funds are
budgeted. Important matters concerning the CNIC are handled
personally by Fidel Castro, whose approval is required for
foreign exchange expenditures such as the purchase of equipment.
contracting of foreign personnel, trips abroad by CNIC per-
sonnel, and recruiting campaigns aimed at foreign scientists.
Fidel Castro, rather than ex-Minister Machado Ventura, appointed
Dr. Wilfredo
the director and other important CNIC executives.
Torres, M.D., hematologist, is CNIC director. The Public Health
Ministry (MINSAP) plays no part in the supervision of the CNIC
and cannot influence the decisions of its executives.
4. The organization and functions of the CNIC are con-
fidential although not secret, and any person who has contact.
with medical professors can acquire some information on the
CNIC. Since about June 1967, an ID card issued by the CNIC to
its employces is required to enter the CNIC buildings and the
private homes that have been equipped as laboratories and resi-
dences.
5. CNIC activities are oriented towards three fundamental
objectives, namely:
a
Scientific research related to the medical sciences.
b. The preparation of highly qualified research and
professorial personnel for employment, after gradu-
ation, as (1) CNIC researchers, (2) researchers of

b. Subject is President or Director of the
Neurophysiology institute (formerly Higher Nervous
Activity Institute), Academy of Sciences: subsource
thinks that Subject is also Professor of Medical
Psychology at Havana University. Subject is a very
well trained psychiatrist and has always enjoyed
great prestige as such; nevertheless, he has always
been reputed to have very low morals, and in medical
circles is "famous" as a woman chaser. He is widely
reputed to attempt to seduce his female patients and
his colleagues' wives. Major Bernabe ORDAZ
Director of Havana Psychiatric Hospital, considers
Subject to be a vulgar political schemer utterly
lacking in personal prestige among Cuban "new"
Communists; Ordaz has stated that he considers that
Subject wants to control Cuban psychiatric practice
for his own personal benefit.
!
C. When Castro took power, Subject surprisingly
abandoned the Immediate Action medical doctors' party
and joined the recently organized Revolutionary Medical
Party; Ordaz did not join this party until 1960.
In medical circles, Subject is reputed to collaborate
with the DSE in brain-washing activities, but subsource
had never seen any direct indications of such
collaboration.
mando F
d. Dr. Armando *DE
employed as a professor at
'
CORDOVA Psychiatrist,"
Havana University, is
a good psychiatrist about 70 years old who has always
been a leftist but is not the type of immoral person
that Bustamante is. De Cordoba and Bustamante travel
together to almost all the psychiatric congresses
held abroad; according to Major Bernabe Ordaz, the two
of them would like to take over the Havana Psychiatric
Hospital, and base their desire on the fact that Ordaz
is not a psychiatrist. In subsource's opinion, they
will never be successful in replacing Ordaz, because
Ordaz enjoys the backing of both Fidel Castro and
Celia Sanchez, who are good friends of his.
e. Subsource has known a Dr. Edmundo GUTIERREZ
Agramonte, Psychiatrist, since 1959; Gutierrez is
Director of the magazine of Havana Psychiatric Hospital
and attends psychiatric congresses held abroad. He is
a competent psychiatrist and has an office located on
Calle 23, corner of Calle 18, Vedado, Havana City.
In subsource's opinion, he is antiregime although he
speaks in favor of the regime when with proregime
persons, and against the regime when with antiregime
persons. He does not belong to the PCC cell at the
hospital and is not a militiaman. In an assembly held
at the hospital in 1969 with the express purpose of
increasing the number of members of the PCC cell, no
one proposed Gutierrez as a possible aspirant. Gutierrez
is about 50 years old and was married about February 1969

(3) members of the faculty of the three Cuban medical
schools (referred to as schools of medical sciences)
located in Havana City, Santa Clara, and Santiago de
Cuba, and (4) biochemists and microbidogists in indus-
tries related to the medical sciences, such as the
pharmaceutical industry.
:
The preparation of personnel for work in the pure
sciences; this third objective constitutes a more
ambitious but long-range goal that was still in the
organizational and planning stage in January 68. Part
of the personnel so trained would remain at the Center
as CNIC researchers; part would join the faculties of
the university schools of pure sciences, and part would
enter Cuban industry to work on the applications of
technology to production.
Scientific Research
6.
Scientific research related to the medical sciences
is done at both the CNIC and at the National Research Institutes.
The general directives for such research are oriented towards:
8.
b.
7.
The experimental verification of conclusions arrived at,
or discoveries made, by foreign scientists. This work
of verification is effected (1) principally in order
to train Cuban personnel in the methods of higher re..
search, but also (2) as an attempt to contribute in-
formation complementary to the discovery.
Original research work done by Cuban personnel advised
by foreign scientists. This work is directed towards
(1) the attainment of results of international impor-
tance to be used in propaganda praising Castro's
education system, and (2) the achievement of discoveries
"in applied science that would serve either as an econ-
omic saving or to earn foreign exchange. As of mid-
January 68, CNIC research projects had produced nothing
of scientific importance. During the first half of 67,
Fidel Castro ordered the CNIC to orient all its re-
search projects towards production technology so that
the foreign exchange invested in the projects could be
partially recovered through improved production.
Department of Biochemistry. The most important of the
CNIC departments is the Department of Biochemistry; it occupies
several new buildings and former private homes. It is headed by
Dr. Mora (fnu), a Chilean microbiologist. This department was
conducting research on polarimetry, enzymology, spectography,
and the synthesis of a steroid hormone from stigmasterol,
sugar-cane by product.
'
a
8. As of mid-January 1968, all attempts to synthesize a
steroid hormone from stigmasterol had failed and will almost
surely continue to fail because stigmasterol is an inert
steroid lacking in biological activity.
9. Dr. Carlos J. Finlay, M.D., was preparing a resech
thesis for the degree of Doctor of Basic Sciences; his research
project, the biochemistry of lipides in cardiovascular diseases,
is of scientific interest although not of international impor-
tance.
10. Department of Ultracentrifugation. Although nominally
a separate department, the Department of Ultracentrifugation
in fact functions as a subdivision of the Department of Bio-
chemistry. As of mid-November 1967 it contained the most moderi

centrifuges then available. Its basic function is the analysis
or separation of the diverse elements that constitute a bio-
logical substance.
11. Department of Electronic Microscopy. This department was
functioning in November 1967 and contained two electron micro-
scopes of the highest quality, one Polish-made and the other
believed to be Japanese. It was performing research in cytology,
ultrastructure (the ultramicroscopic structure of tissues of
living beings), crystallography, and the three-dimensional
spatial structure of certain biological substances.
12. DEpartment of Medical Botany. This department is headed
by a very intelligent and cultured Spanish agronomist named
Guillermo Cid who has been in Cuba since 1940. It is effecting
a systematic study of Cuban flora in order to determine the
pharmacological and therapeutical properties of Cuban plants.
The department works in coordination with the experimental
station in Santiago de las Vegas that is directed by the eminent
92-year old Dr. Juan Tomas Roig Mesa, who is the greatest Cuban
expert on Cuban and tropical TTōra and one of the greatest

two objectives:
a.
b.
The utilization of the curative properties of the
plants, which constitute a cheap supply of national
raw materials and can replace many imported pro-
ducts.
The launching on the world market of competitive
pharmaceutical products, following the example
of Red China and Bulgaria.
13. The work of the Department of Medical Botony will pro-
bably be successful because of (a) the qualifications and com-
petence of its director, Guillermo Cid, (b) the extraordinary
impulse that has been imparted to its research program, and
(c) the extraordinary richness of Cuban flora in medicinal plants.

ment is aware of the enormous medical importance of the appli-
cation of cybernetics (problem solving by electronic computers)
to the analysis, organization, and resolution of the very complex
physicochemical problems that the biology of living beings pre-
sents; the Government is attempting to organize this department,
which will train highly qualified personnel and import electronic
computers (a) for the study of the complex physicochemical pro-
blems related principally to hematology, neurophysiology, and
cardiology and cardiovascular surgery, and (b) for the computa-
tion for public health purposes of the vast amounts of public--¨
health data of different types that the MINSAP regiona organi-
zations would provide.

16. The research projects of this department were to be
directed fundamentally towards the study and electronic compu-
tation of the modification in both healthy and sick persons of
such: biological parameters as hemodynamic curves, concentra-
tion and saturation of gases and alterations in the basic acid
equilibrium of the blood, and were to include the study of the
variations in the biological parameters from the biochemical
and hemodynamic point of view during cardiovascular surgery
and in physiological research related to the cardiovascular ap-
paratus. In neurophysiology and neuropharmacology, the re-
search projects would be oriented towards research on higher
nervous activity including electrical modifications produced
in higher nervous activity; in hematology, the projects would
be oriented towards the study of isoimmunization and patho-
logical alterations of the different blood cells. The electron-
ic computers would be needed to process the immense quantities
of data such research would produce.
17. Dr. Fernando J. Toro, a medical doctor who is also
an electrical engineer, was to head this department. Toro
is reputed to be very intelligent, a gifted organizer, highly
motivated, and by far the best man available in Cuba for the
type of research described; he has more than 20 years ex-
perience in electromedical instruments.
18. Reduced Number of Research Projects. The scarcity
of research projects can easily be explained by the fact tha
Cuba, which has no considerable scientific tradition, must
first train personnel in the higher methods of scientific
research, and such training requires years of effort. The few
persons prepared to do important research are at the present
time occupied in the administrative and pedagogical organization
of the CNIC and cannot work full-time as researchers.
19. Research in Antibiotics. In 1960, Dr. Jose Antonio
Padron, an eminent research scientist, began work on the isola-
tion and culture of antibiotic substances, the study of their
properties, and experimentation with said substances; he ini-
tiated this work at the Oncological Hospital but is now a CNIC
collaborator. As of December 1967, he had isolated and exhaus-
tively studied 89 new antibiotics, many of which are too toxic.
for human use. His work demonstrates his great ability and
perserverance, and with the material resources of the CNIC at
his disposal, should result in discoveries of scientific im-
portance.
CNIC Training Program
"
20. Doctor of Basic Sciences. The CNIC offers a three-
year training program leading to the degree of Doctor of Basic
Sciences for which program fifth-year medical students with
exceptional academic standing can qualify if (a) during their
college career they have shown special aptitudes for teaching
and research, (b) the UJC gives them an "A" grade in political
standing or reliability, and (c) they are cleared by a DSE
investigation. In 1966,
In 1966, of the students then in the fifth
year of medical school, only six were accepted by this training
program; all were excellent students and UJC members and are
now medical doctors: Ramon Ortiz, Rosa Elena Simeon, Ismael
Clark Arce, Hilda Donderis, Julio Rodriguez Docal, and his
Wife Maira (lnu). As of April 1968, probably no more than 30
students were studying in this training program, chiefly be-
cause of the rigorous entrance requirements.

gynecologic laparoscopy, and laparoscopy in pediatrics.
assistants were Dr.. Oscar Garcias, and Dr. Arcadio Soto Escouar
also employed as instructor of the Department of Internal Medi-
cine, Havana University Medical School.
40. In August 1966, the ground floor of the institute con-
tained the most modern radiological equipment in Cuba, including
X-ray machines and fluoroscopes; each of the machines had a
seriografo and occupied a square room measuring about four meters
Square. The zere two rooms for laparoscopic examinations
and four or five wards with a total of approximately 50 beds.
On the ground floor there were also eight small rooms (4 x 2
reters) for biliary drainages and gastroquimogramas, the Depart-
ment of Electrophoresis, a conference hall, a laboratory of
pathological anatomy, a clinical laboratory, three or four bed-
rooms for resident physicians, two waiting rooms for out-patients,
and the Department of Coloprotologia (Proctology ?), headed by.
Dr. Oscar Garcia, Cuba's best proctologist, who is also Vice
Rector of Havana University and Vice President of the MINSAP ·
Scientific Council. The second floor contained a library for
which volumes were beginning to be received, and several rooms
still unequipped that would be used for research to be conducted
by Dr. Llanio ir person.
-
41. Neurology and Neurosurgery Institute, The Neurology
and Neurosurgery Institute functions at two separate installations.
Its headquarters is located in the former building of the
Governing Board of the Calixto Garcia Hospital, which also contains
the Department of Psychiatry of the Calixto Garcia Hospital.
This building contains the neurosurgical installations of the
institute, consisting in three splendidly equipped operating
rooms, two or three rooms containing radiological equipment, a
laboratory of pathological anatomy, out patient examination rooms,
conference room, library, filing room about 70 beds, and hed
rooms for residents and interns. The building was totally re-
built in 1965 and equipped with U.S. $100,000 worth of new
instruments and equipment:
,
42. The Hospital of Neurology and Neurosurgery (formerly
the Medical-Surgical Center), located on 29th and D Streets, Ve-
dado, Havana City, also belongs to the institute. Dr. Ramon
Estrada, Director of the Hospital of Neurology and Neurosurgery,
is Professor of Neuroanatomy, was trained in the United States
and is described as extraordinarily able; he maintains a degree
of medical rivalry with the Director of the Neurology and
Neurosurgery Institute, Dr. Filiberto Ramirez Corria, that makes
the hospital an-autonomous organization although it functions
in courdination with the institute. The hospital has about 275
beds and is a modern class "A" hospital; residents in interna]
medicine must spend three months in intensive study at this
hospital.
43. Physiopathology Institute. The Institute of Physio-
pathology was in the process of organization. It will probabi.
be headed by Chilean biochemist Dr. Mora (fnu) who, until about
October 67, held thepost of director of post-graduate scientific
training (responsable de superacion cientifica) of the CNIC,
and who is now head of the Department of Biochemistry, CNIC..
Dr. Mora and Dr. Ruth Urba, another Chilean microbiologist,
introduced into Cuba the modern concepts of medical biochemistry
and created a model Department of Medical Biochemistry at the
Victoria de Giron Institute of Basic Sciences. Urba, who left
Cuba some time ago, Mora, and Yamil Kouri were the brains penHAI

attempt has been made to organize the institute like the
Cleveland Clinic. Dr. Roberto Manalich and Dr. Villalba (fnu)
work with. Dr. Buch.
3i.
In January 1968, the MINSAP created a three-year
residency in nephrology and appointed Dr. Frankie Dorticos as
the first resident; Dorticos is the son of the Dean of the
Havana University Medical School and nephew of President
Dorticos. Artifical kidneys were installed at both the Santa
Clara Civil Hospital and the Santiago de Cuba Hospital in
late 1967; these artificial kidneys are for use in treating
kidney disease rather than for medical research.
i
35. Hematology Institutė. The Hematology Institute
has departments at the William Soler Hospital, the Fajardo
Hospital, and the National Hospital, all located in Havana
City. The institute has no building of its own and its
activities are located at the three best hematological clinics
in Cuba, as enumerated above. The Director of the Hematology
Institute is Dr. Eduardo de la Torre, who is also chief of the
Department of Hematology, William Soler Hospital. Dr. Ulacia
(fnu), who is probably Cuba's best hematologist, is chief of
the Department of Hematology of the Fajardo Hospital.
36. The most important research project of the Hematology
Institute was initiated about July 66 and consisted of the
study of the "utilization of isoniazida in the treatment of
Werholf's (as received) discase purpura trombopenica idio-
patica."
The value of isoniazida in the treatment of Werholf's
disease was discovered by chance under the following circum-
stances: A child hospitalized in the hematological department
of the William Soler hospital for treatment of Werholf's dis-
ease contracted a primary tuberculosis infection; when this
infection was treated with isoniazida, the symptom-complex of
Werholf's disease disappeared completely and no relapse occur-
red: As of January 1968, 22 such cases had been studied and the
conclusions were being prepared for presentation at a Hemato-
logical Congress; the biological mechanism of the treatment had
not yet been determined, but it was considered that the experi-
mental stage had been completed.
•

37. Dr. Eduardo de la Torre was performing research
principally of a statistical nature on leucemias. Infantile
leucemia was being studied at the William Soler Hospital and
at the Angel Arturo Aballi Children's Hospital, located in
Arroyo Naranjo, liavana; this research followed the treatment
scheme of Swelzer and the University of California scheme
known internationally as V.A.M.P.
38. Gastroenterology Institute. The Gastroenterology
Institute occupies the two-story building at the Calixto Garcia
Hospital which was formerly occupied by the hospital library.
Its Director is Dr. Raimundo Llanio Navarro, who was brought
to world-wide eminence when he presented his study "Colangio-
grafia Laparoscopica en la Lactante" at the Brussels Congress
in 1965. When the Gastroenterology Institute was officially
established in early 1967, it had been functioning for about
two years. In January 1967, Dr. Humberto Rodriguez Hidalgo and
Dr. Mirna Quintero were admitted as residents; their admission
as residents coincided with the establishment at the institute.
of a training program for specialists in gastroenterology.

medical school, it is an organism attached to Havana Univer-
sity Medical School. Students wishing to study medicine or
stomatology at Havana University must study first two years
as boarding students at the Victoria de Gizon Institute.
Neither Santiago de Cuba nor Santa Clara has a similar insti-
tute.
28. As of September 1967, students from Las Villas,
Camaguey, and Oriente Provinces who desire to enter medical
school as first-year students must matriculate at either
Santa Clara or Santiago de Cuba University; this measure was
put into effect in order to reduce congestion at Havana Uni-
versity.
National Research Institutes
29. The following National Research Institutes, organized
by medical specialties, work in coordination with the CNIC but
are subordinate to the MINDAP. All were organized as "insti-
tutes" during the first three months of 1967, although some had
been functioning for years under different names. All are
clinical research institutes that work primarily with patients.
Each institute controls all the hospital departments throughout
For
Cuba that correspond to the specialty of the institute.
example: The Endocrinology Institute controls all the hospital
departments of endocrinology in Cuba.
30. Endocrinology Institute. The Endocrinology Institute
replaced the former Institute for Endocrinological Research
that was founded and directed by Dr. Yamil Kouri. The insti–
tute is located at the same site as the former institute: the
ground floor of the left wing of the Fajardo Hospital, Havana
City. It is headed by Dr. Oscar Mateo de Acosta, M.D., Cuba's
most eminent endocrinologist. Dr. Mateo is extraordinarily
intelligent, a university professor and PCC member, and is one
of the scientific bulwarks of the Castro Regime. Mateo's
assistants include Dr. Catalina Eibenschuz, who is married to
Dr. Mora, head of the CNIC Department of Biochemistry, and
was studying endocrincology in France in early €8; Dr. Barto-
lome Arce, who studied in Rumania and was studying in France.
in early 68; and a young medical doctor named Oviedo (fnu),
who was probably to be sent to Sweden to study.
31.
The Endocrinology Institute enjoys a large budget
because of Dr. Mateo's scientific eminence and political.
"virtues". It has excellent equipment for electrophoresis,
ultracentrifuges, and photocolorimeters.
32. Nephrology Institute. The Nephrology Institute is
located on the fifth floor of the Joaquin Albarran Clinical-
Surgical Hospital, Avenida 26 at Avenida Rancho Boyeros, Havana.
It is headed by Dr. Abelardo Buch, M.D., an extraordinarily
abl.: researcher who was working on:
b.
acute, chronic renal insufficiency,
microdeterminations of certain normal quantities of
the renal apparatus, and
C.
the experimental verification of modern theories
that explain the physiopathology of shock and its
treatment; his experiments were based on the research
hypothesis of Dr. Richard Lillehei, chief of the
Department of Surgery, Minnesota University.

The
Psychology and Neurophysiology Institute.
Psychology and Neurophysiology Institute (formerly the Higher
Nervous Activity Institute) occupies the building formerly
occupied by the Banco de Piedad, in Reparto Alturas del
Vedado, Havana. City. The institute is headed by Jose Angel
Bustamante, M.D., who is very intelligent and very well
örganized. As of mid-May 1966, the ground floor contained the
lobby, three rooms used for psychiatric care, a sicofarmaco
storeroom, the Department of Neuropharmacology, two small
rooms for experimental surgery, about 20 cages for experimental
animals, three rooms containing electromedical instruments used
by Dr. Toro (see paragraph 17) in his research work, including
three electroencephalographs, two electrocardiographs, electro-
miografos, ammeters, voltmeters, etc., two or three rooms for
animals in which scientific instruments have been imbedded for
the experimental verification of certain physiological data,
two rooms used to study conditioned reflexes in rats, a long
corridor (about. 30 meters long) equipped with bells; lights,
and gates, in which Dr. Diego Gonzalez was studying sintesis
aferente de Anoyshen, two rooms in which Dr. Jose Aquino was
conducting experiments on the effects of ouabaina on the central
nervous system, and other undescribed experiments. The second
floor contained the files, library, conference hall, and rooms
for which no specific function had yet been determined.
3
45. As of May 1966, Dr. Bustamante was doing research on
social psychology (the psychological characteristics of indi-...
viduals belonging to a specific socioeconomic group) and had
very ambitious plans to use electronic data processing machines
to study the electrochemical processes and the servomechanisms
of higher nervous activity; these ambitious plans were to be
put into effect in 1967. The land located behind the institute
was to serve for the construction of other departments of the
institute.
46. Hygiene and Epidemiology Institute. The Hygiene and
Epidemiology Institute functions at two separate installations.
Institute headquarters and its hygiene section occupy a
building on Calle Infanta, Havana City. Dr. Cosme Ordoñez,
M.D., is director of the institute; he is described as very
intelligent and very well-organized. During the first six
months of 1967 he took a course in hygiene and epidemiology
at the University of London. Dr. Plasencia (fnu) is another of
the principal figures at the institute.
47. Public health data received from all parts of Cuba
are processed at the institute headquarters on Cale Infanta
(DOJ: September 1966). In addition to the hygiene section
institute headquarters contains a well-equipped Virology Depart-
ment, which has an electron microscope, a well-equipped Seruas
and Vaccines Department, a school for public-health workers,
and a school of medical statisticians.
48. The epidemiological section of the institute is
located at Las Animas Anti-infectious Hospital, Havana, at
which medical care is provided and research work done. Las..
Animas Hospital was totally rebuilt during the period 1962-65
and is a model hospital that compares favorably with any other

During the first year of the three-year program, the
students, all of whom are medical doctors, study (a) mathe-.
matics: mathematical analysis (higher algebra), analytical
geometry, and trigonometry; (b) physics: mechanics (kinematics
statics, and dynamics), mechanics of liquids and gases, and
heat; (c) chemistry; inorganic and organic; (d) languages
Hessian, English, Fiench, or German); dialectical and histori-
cal materialism; and logic of science. The classes occupy
both mornings and afternoons and include seminars given by
the professors; under a rotation system, the students also
give seminars in which each by turn first lectures on presides
over the ensuing debate. In addition, the students review the
bibliography of subjects related to medicine, such as studies
on biochemistry, pharmacology, etc.
. 22. During the second year of the three-year program,
the students continue to study the pure sciences: mathematics
(infinitesimal analysis), physics (optics and electromagnetism),
and organic chemistry, plus dialectical and historical material-
ism, languages, and a specific medical speciality selected by
the individual student. In addition, the students serve as
instructors of biochemistry, physiology, etc., at the Victoria
de Giron premedical school.
23. During the third year, each student (a) continues to
serve as an instructor at the Victoria de Giron premedical
school, (b) continues to study in his own specialty, such as
biochemistry, neurophysiology, electronic microscopy, genetics,
virology, etc., (c) undertakes an original research project
under the guidance of a professor who is usually a foreigner,
(d) writes a thesis based on the research project, presents it,
and defends it before a tribunal, and (e) completes an examina-
tion in the specialty he has chosen. If the thesis is approved
and the student passes the examination in his specialty, he
receives the title of Doctor of Basic Sciences and either becomes
a'member of the faculty of one of the three Cuban medical
schools (Paragraph 5.b.above) or stays on at the CNIC as a
research assistant.
24. During the first year, students receive 225 Cuban
pesos monthly. During the second year they receive 250 pesos
monthly, and during the third year they receive 300 pesos
monthly. In addition, the students receive a free lunch and
supper daily.
25.
In late 1968, the CNIC will graduate its first two
Doctors of Basic Sciences: Dr. Carlos J. Finlay, M.D., who
studied in France, and Morlan (fnu), who studied in Rumania;
both will remain at the CNIC after graduation and do research
in biochemistry.
26.
Doctor of Pure Sciences. Candidates for the CNIC
training program leading to the degree of Doctor of Pure
Sciences must satisfy requirements similar to those described
in paragraph 20 above: candidates must be outstanding students
in one of the pure sciences (chemical, physical, mathematical,
or biological sciences) who, throughout their entire college
career have demonstrated special aptitudes for teaching and
scientific research, and who are Communist sympathizers approved
by the UJC.

53. Because of Director Noel Gonzalez's executive capacity,
professional ability, and political relations, this institute has
In December 67,
received strong economic support since mid-1966.
Dr. Roberto Guerra and Dr. Roberto Menchaca were preparing to
leave for Europe where they would spend approximately one year
studying and purchasing surgical equipment for the institute.
54. Microbiology and Virology Institute. This institute
is in the process of organization. It will have departments in.
the CNIC and in the headquarters building of the Hygiene and
Epidemiology Institute, Calle Infanta, Havana City.
55. Angiology Institute. The Angiology Institute is located
on the second floor of the Luaces Clinic, Calixto Garcia Hospital,
and is directed by Dr. Jorge MacCook, one of Cuba's best angio-
logists. . The activities of this institute are oriented basical-
ly towards the treatment of patients and the instruction of
medical students. The chief Cuban angiologists are Dr. MacCook,
Dr. Francisco Bidart Labourdette, Director of Angiology at the
Clinical-Surgical Hospital, and Dr. Huguet. (fnu), Director of
Angiology, National Hospital.
56. Parasitology Institute. This institute occupies the
former Parasitology Clinic of the Calixto Garcia Hospital. Dr.
Pedro Kouri was to have been named Director but died before the
institute was formally organized. The institute's activities
are oriented principally towards the treatment of patients and
the instruction of medical students.
57. Oncology Institute. As of late 1967, the official
creation of an institute to be named the Oncology Institute was
under consideration; said institute would be headed by Dr.
Zoilo Marinello Vidaurreta, who presides the Scientific Council
of the MINSAP and is the director of the Oncological Hospital,
29th and C Streets, Vedado, Havana City. An organization similar
to the projected Oncology Institute has been functioning at
the Oncological Hospital for about two years.

f. Dr/ *M\IGNA GARAY whose first
name subsource thinks is Ruben, worked at Havana
Psychiatric Hospital (formerly Mazorra) prior to
1959. He is proregime but not an extremist and
does not appear to be "willing to die for the
regime". Mignagaray was proposed as an aspirant
to the PCC cell at the Hospital, in an assembly
held in 1969, but stated that he had a defect
consisting in the fact that he was in love. Subsource
did not know whether he was accepted as an aspirant.
In mid-December 1969, Dr. Cristino Cabello, employed
as a psychiatrist at Havana Psychiatric Hospital,
told subsource that Mignagaray had told him that he
(Cabello) would have to take over Mignigaray's ward
because he was going abroad to attend a psychiatric
congress; subsource could give no further information
on the congress or Mignagaray's date of departure.
Mignagaray is described as a light-skinned mulatto,
about 5'9" tall, weight about 160 pounds, 60-65
years old, brown eyes, greying hair, married; subsource
thought he had three children.
FERNANDEZ
Martinez,
g. Dr. Lino Bernabe
Psychiatrist, joined the anti-Castro counterrevolutionary
forces in the Escambray mountains a few months before
the Playa Giron invasion; he was arrested shortly
before said invasion and sentenced to 30 years in
prison. Subsource had met him when both were students
at Belen High School%; their friendship continued at
Havana University, when both were members of the
Havana University Catholic 'Group, and later as members
of the Movement for the Recuperation of the Revolution
(MRR). Subsource took leave of Fernandez the day that
the latter joined the anti-Castro counterrevolutionaries,
and never saw him again. When subsource visited his
brother-in-law, Enrique Casuso, held first on the
Isle of Pines, then at La Cabana and later at the
Guanajay Jail, he habitually asked for news of
Dr. Fernandez; the information he received made him
believe that Fernandez is one of the most respected
prisoners because of his bravery and equilibrium.
Fernandez was mentioned as an example of integrity.
Other prisoners such as Dr. Andres CAO, Juan
BUSTAMANTE, and Antonio GARCI A told
subsource that Fernandez' attitude had not varied.
Fernandez' wife, Emilia LUZARRAGA who
frequently visited subsource professionally (subsource
was her psychiatrist), also told subsource that
Fernandez' attitude was firmly antiregime: 'Luzarraga
is also antiregime.
h. Vicky ANDRIA L, a friend of Emilia
Luzarraga's who sometimes accompanied her on her.
visits to subsource, is married to Dr. Armando ZALD
Pita, M.D., aka "Manduco", who is incarcerated at the
Guanajay Jail. Subsource thought that he had been in
jail since before the Playa Giron invasion%; he had
belonged to both the Havana University Catholic Group
and the MRR. Subsource's brother-in-law, Enrique Casuso,
and Vicky Andrial both told subsource that Dr. Zaldivar
continued to be unyielding in his antiregime-attitude.

2. ACCORDING TO JOAQUIN ALVAREZ REMENTOL, CUBAN VICE-
MINISTER OF FOREIGN TRADE IN CHARGE OF NORTH AMERICAN AND
WESTERN EUROPENAN AFFAIRS, THE RECENT PURGE BY FIDEL CASTRO OF
A NUMBER OF OLD-GUARD COMMUNISTS, INCLUDING ANIBAL ESCALANTE,
WILL NOT HAVE MAJOR CONSEQUENCES. FROM THE INTERNAL POINT OF
VIEW, THE PURGE AND THE CONDEMNATION OF ESCALANTE ARE ESSEN-
TIALLY A DEMONSTRATION OF FORCE ON THE PART OF CASTRO AND A
WARNING TO THE USSR AND OTHER SOCIALIST COUNTIRIES, AS WELL AS
TO THE CUBANS, THAT THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT IN WHOSE HANDS POWER
LIES IN CUBA. THE PURGE AND ARRESTS CSHOULD HAVE LITTLE IMPACT
ON ECONOMIC RELATIONS SETWEEN CUBA AND THE USSR. FROM A BRIEF.
TALK WITH GERMAN AMADO BLANCO, MINISTRY OF FOREIGN TRADE OFFICIAL
WHO RECENLTY RETURNED FROM MOSCOW AFTER HAVING SPENT MONTHS
NEGOTIATING A COMMERCIAL AGREEMENT, ALVAREZ REMENTOL CONCLUDED
THAT THERE WILL NOT BE ANY SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES IN CUBAN-SOVIET
ECONOMIC RELATIONS OR SOVIET ASSISTANCE, AND THERE MAY EVEN BE
A FEW IMPROVEMENTS. THE SOVIETS WILL CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN ES-
SENTIAL ECONOMIC AID TO CUBA. THE RECENT PURGE AND ARRESTS SHOULD

BUSTAMANTE POINTED OUT THAT ESCALANTE HAS LONG BEEN CONNECTED
WITH A SOVIET ADVISER OF THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR IN CUBA,
EVIDENTLY A KG3 AGENT, WHO INTRODUCED HIM TO HIS SUCCESSOR.
THE OFFICIAL DECLARATIONS MADE AGAINST ESCALANTE AND HIS GROUP,
PARTICULARLY THOSE OF RAUL CASTRO, PLACED THE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THE ACTIVITIES OF ANIBAL ESCALANTE ON THE USSR. BUSTAMANTE
NOTED THAT UNTIL VERY RECENTLY THERE WAS IN THE CUBAN MINISTRY
OF INTERIOR A FRENCH ADVISER AND FORMER MEMBER OF THE FRENCH
SURETE, WHO APPARENTLY WAS AT ODDS WITH SOVIET ADVISERS OVER
IME ORGANIZATION OF THE WORK OF THE STATE SECURITY. BUSTAMANTE
HEARD ABOUT THIS FRENCHMAN VIA SEVERAL OF HIS FRENCH PATIENTS
OR CONTACTS, WHO TOLD HIM OF HAVING MET THE FRENCH ADVISER ON
SEVERAL OCCASIONS. THE EXISTENCE OF THE FRENCH ADVISER WAS
CONFIRMED TO BUSTAMANTE BY A CUBAN DOCTOR FRIEND WHO ALSO WORKED
IN THE CUBAN MINISTRY OF INTERIOR. BUSTAMANTE IMPLIED THAT THE
FRENCH ADVISER HAD RECENLTY RETURNED-TO-FRANCE.
4. (SOURCE COMMENT: IT IS THE OPINION OF A NUMBER OF
KNOWLEDGEABLE PERSONS IN HAVANA THAT ESCALANTE WAS A SOVIET
AGENT.)

NOT HAVE FAR-REACHING RPERCUSSIONS ON THE POLITICAL RELATIONS
SETWEEN CUBA AND THE USSR, AS NUMEROUS DIFFERENCES OF VIEWS
HAVE EXISTED FOR SOME TIME AND ARE WELL KNOWN. THESE DIF-
FERENCES WILL PROBABLY NOT AFFECT THE ESSENCE OF CURRENT
POLITICAL RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES. CASTRO KNOWS
THAT THE USSR CANNOT GO BEYOND A CERTAIN POINT IN ECONOMIC AND
POLITICAL MEASURES DESIGNED TO PRESSURE HIM TO FOLLOW A POLICY
MORE IN AGREEMENT WITH SOVIET INTEREST. HE CONTINUES TO GIVE
OPEN SUPPORT TO ARMED STRUGGLES IN LATIN AMERICA, SUCH AS
VENEZUELA, AND ELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD IN COMPLETE OPPOSITION TO
SOVIET POLICY. THIS POLICY OF INDEPENDENCE HAS WON CASTRO
SYMPATHIES IN AND OUTSIDE CUBA. THE CUBANS, WHO LIKE OTHER
LATIN AMERICANS HAVE A CERTAIN VANITY, LIKE TO THINK THAT THEY
LIVE IN A SMALL BUT BRAVE COUNTRY WHICH IS "NOT GOING TO LET
ANYONE PUT ANYTHING OVER ON IT."
.3. ACCORDING TO DR. JOSE ANGEL BUSTAMANTE, HEAD OF THE
FACULTY OF PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF HAVANA,
THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT ANIBAL ESCALANTE WAS AN AGENT OF THE
SOVIET INTELLIGENCE SERVICE. (FIELD COMMENT: BUSTAMANTE HAS
OFTEN BEEN ACCUSED OF, AND HAS DENIED, CLANDESTINE RELATION-
//
SHIP WITH THE CUBAN MINISTRY OF INTERIOR AND INTELLIGENCE SERVICE.)

BUSTAMANTE appeared grateful for this offer and gave
when he had lunch with him on 30 April. Photocopies of these letters are
forwarded under separate cover. We leave any exploitation of the information
contained in these letters to Headquarters. Of some interest is the fact.
that BUSTAMANTE hopes to attend a medical congress in Mexico in December
1967. Also interesting are the details which the doctor gives on his work
in Cuba. BUSTAMANTE mentions, for example in his letter to Dr. Alfonsc
MILLAN in Mexico, that he is currently making two separate investigations
"Haterial and moral enducements for productivity" and "Motivation of a
religious group in Cuba." A reply to one of BUSTANAUTE's letters received
by Mon 26 April is also attached under separate cover. Information
provided by BUSTAMANTE on the rise and fall of Drs. MACHADO Ventura and
Rene VALLEJO as Fidel Castro's private physicians and confidante was
disseminated in a separate intelligence report..

first of a series of articles and of a monograph,
was published in the April 1966 issue of the American
Journal of Psychotherapy. This takes in a great deal
of analysis that would be included under transcultural
psychiatry. Indeed, we are using the systems analysia
approach which, of course, must take into account the
broad psychosocial and socioeconomic forces that in-
fluence the psychodynamics matrices in individuals.
I am interested in the particular securities that are
precipitated in the ego structure of individuals by
the very nature of the socioeconomic, sociopolitical
and sociophilosophic system in which the individual
lives: In an opposite vein, we are interested in the
stresses that are placed upon the individual by vari-
ous social systems from individual and practical stand-
points. Awarenesses such as these should be of help
in the planning of social systems for underdeveloped
nations. While this seems like a very ambitious con-
ceptualization, I do not believe that it is an unlikely
possibility in the coming generations.
I look forward to receive the copy of your
book "Psicologia Medica", Volume I. I believe that the
outline as you presented it to me seems very inclusive.

OF your information and possible investigation,
debrioring of Jose Francisco BOTET Carrion, DPOB: 14 April
1938, Havana, Cuba, engineering technician who arrived as a
refugee in Spain on 30 January 1970, produced the following story:
.
During the first two weeks of January 1970,
Hource's father, Jose F. BOTET who still is in
Cuba
I told him that he had met in Havana a Dr. MOLINA
who was a physician who has been residing in Chicago,
1111nois fer the past 20 years. MOLINA told Source's
father that he had come to Cuba to see the psychiatrist
BUSTAMANTE (Jose BUSTAMANTE O'Leary, 201-022396 ?)
Who Havana rumors said has been involved in helping,
some way or other, Cuban political prisoners in
La cabain.
•
?).
BOTET's father recalled that MOLINA had
A brother who was just finishing a prison term
(110 supposed for counterrevolutionary activities) and
essed that MOLINA's visit was related to this fact.
MOLINA would not confirm this, nor did he reveal what
Means he used to enter Cuba. At the time of Source's
departure, 29 April 1970, MOLINA was still in Havana.
Unfortunately, Source could not recall MOLINA's full
name but remembers having seen him briefly in New York
in 1061.
MOLINA is age 63/64, white, 5'8" tall,
170 lbs.
8.
.
In view of the growing number of cases involving attempts
to ransom Cuban political prisoners, it may be that MOLINA is
playing an active role in the release of his brother and possibly
others.
If the BUSTAMANTE concerned is BUSTAMANTE O'Leary,
the Frusted headshrinker of the regime, then this report may
indicate that ho is cooperating, with or without regime knowledge,
in obtaining the release of certain political prisoners.

Reshad previously met Dr. BUSTAMANTE via a common friend,
Dr. Guillermo DAVILA, a Mexican physician who occasionally gives L-1 messages
and publications for delivery in Havana. DAVILA asked
to say ☑
hello to his Cuban friend, which L-1 did on 27 March. During the ensuing
conversation, BUSTAMANTE mentioned that he attended the World Congress of
Psychology in the Soviet Union in August 1966. He had previously visited the
USSR in 1961, and found great changes in that country. He felt that a
definite evolution had taken place between 1961 and 1966, bringing life in
the Soviet Union several steps closer to that in the Western countries.
also found radical changes in the field of his professional specialty.
Psychiatric and psychological "trends in the USSR, he felt, had broken away
from the rigid doctrines that limited their development until a few years
ago and had grown more liberal. Several specialists who had been ostracized
for psychiatric and psychological theories contrary to those officially
accepted in the USSR had been rehabilitated.

I: December 14, 1966, I wrote you a long letter giving you
all the information about our activities at the Institute.
not heard from you ever since, and I am afraid this letter did not
reach you at all, therefore, I am enclosing a copy and following
are a few more news about this year's activities so far.
I wish to let you know that in July our new Review called
Transcultural Psychiatry will be published here. As soon as it is
out, I will mail you a copy. We are editing it and it will be the
first of its kind in our language.
We have an Anthropologist working with us at the Institute
now, Dr. Antonio Santa Cruz, a Yale graduate, and we are planning a
joint book on Transcultural Psychiatry since there is not a treatise
in Spanish on this subject. I will let you know as to its develop-
ment.
In 'reference to the Reviews that you so kindly offered to send
us, we are for the time being overcoming the shortage we were ex-
periencing. Instead, and if at all possible, I would like to receive
Vol. III of the American Handbook of Psychiatry, edited by Silvano
Arieti. I have Vols. I and II, and would be obliged to you if you
could send it to me.
Although I know your interest is in Psychiatry, I wish to
inform you that we are organizing a Symposium of Psychology which
will take place in Havana, the 24-30 of November, 1966, convened by
the Institute and the Academy of Sciences. Its subject will be:
"Motivation: neurophysiologic, psychologic and social factors.
pective of an integration". The paper could be on motivation:
can be an interdisciplinary subject, as well as neurophysiologic,
psychologic or a social one.

I do not know whether you are interested or not, but in case
you are, please let me know and I will send you an invitation. The
guests' stay will be borne by the Academy of Sciences, and we have

Three of the scientists that have already accepted to come to
the Symposium visited the Institute this year. One of them was Dr.
Vladimir D. Nebylitsyn, Vice-Director of the Institute of Psychology
from Moscow, who stayed two months with us. He helped us to create
a typology laboratory in our Psychology Department.

His conception is
by Pavlov and later on were developed by Teplov and his collaborators.
De Nebylitsyn, as well as other investigators, have developed
some scientific methods on the investigation of such properties of
the nervous system and their studies nowadays can very well be
correlated with certain personality dimensions. It has been thus
proven by some investigators abroad and today, in Cuba, we need to
begin developing such scientific methods.
We also had Dr. E. Roy John, from the New York Medical College,
who spent a month here. Following is a brief resumé of his activities
at the Institute.
In the mornings, Dr. John gave a lecture on physiology of
learning, having memory as a basic theme, explained every possible
way, psychological, physiological, biochemical and anatomically. The
lecture was discussed by those attending, and experimental solutions
were proposed for various problems not yet resolved. The text book
used in this course was written by Dr. John himself and will be out
of print by now.
In the afternoons, four different experiments were carried
out. The first one on egoked potentials in humans, correlations of
same facing luminous stimulations of different colors.
expectancy situations. The second experiment was on learning,

lu-
System on learning. Stimulations of different specific structures
and of reticular watching the importance of the facilitation of this
mechanism. The fourth experiment was a study with microelectrodes
of neuronal activity changes during the learning stage in cronic
animals...
Both Dr. Nebylitsyn and Dr. John dictated very interesting

conferences at the Academy of Sciences' 'Conference Hall and at the
Scientific Council of the Ministry of Public Health.
At the moment, we have Dr. E. Grastyán, from the University
of Pece, Hungary, who will leave soon after collaborating with the
Department of Psychology for two months. He has been working on
motivation and cooperating in a joint work for our coming Symposium.
I think I should let you know that I have written to Dr. D.1
Leigh, Secretary to the World Psychiatric Association and among other
things I indicated the convenience to create one Committee or Section
of Transcultural Psychiatry within the World Psychiatric Association
because this is a rather new and multi-disciplinary field (comprising
psychologists, psychiatrists, anthropologists, etc.) requiring more
than any other one the cooperation and help to facilitate the efforts
to keep producing and offering contributions in the development of
this field.
I have secured a better way to get our mail and it consists
of the following: address your envelope to Laboratorios Erba, Apartado
21909, Mexico 21, D.F., Mexico, and the letter to me. Once they open
the letter and see it is addressed to me, a member of the laboratory
will bring it personally to me as they travel back and forth between
our countries. I will address my letters to you and they will mail
them in Mexico to you. In this way, we are both sure our mail will
not get lost since I have absolute confidence in them.
I think I have covered everything of interest to you.
Hoping to hear from you soon, and with best wishes, I remain,
Cordially yours,

Prefessor of Psychiatry

New Haven, Coansatieat
United States of America
Dear Dr. Redlich:
According to our ecarversation I am writing to you in order to
let you knew all about the Institute of Neurophysiology and Paysho
Lexy of the Academy of Sciences of Cuba, and the Department of
Medical Peyahalegy of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of
HAVERA,
Our Institute, which began its activities in 1962, has three
Departments: Neurophysiology, Psychology and Social Psychology,
and was founded by the School of Medicine, becoming one of the
Institutes of the Academy of Seienees in 1965.
a
The Department of Neurophysiology is working on the following
investigations:
a) Influences of some druge er chemical substances which
fever and inhibit Leno's spreading depression on con-
vulsive crisis.
b) on e
Cardistonic influences on avoidance reflex.
21
Study on the electrical activity of Zachrisia Guanensis'
nervous system.
d). Drug-dependence learning an eat and rat.
The Psychology Department is working on these investigations:
on
Study on the participant variables in the Physician-Patient
relationship in individual psychstherapy and in group
paychotherapy.
b) Randesteadiness and Motivation.
Forscanlity factors of the physician in Intregenie
disturbanses.
Motivation and motor setivity.
Hypnosis and learning.
Department of Secial Psychology is doing the next researches: *
Attitude survey on medical school students.
Social Maladjusted behavior in Camaguey Province.
Study on bureanerney.
At the time this was written.

:
The Secial Paychology Department is not a laboratory on Social
Selenses; it is not a Sesiology Department, and if you will, it is
net ruled by a Paychologised concept of Sociology.
It is a laboratory where modest social aspects of our medium are
studied with the purpose to know the values and stereotypes offered in
cur medium in cemusation with the psychological Betivity.
Thus, the investigations to study the attitudes and opinions of the
young Cuban studems as wellas the study of the ambitions of the man in
the fields, in his wa lands or in collective farms, are carried out in
this Secial Psychology Department.
For the first time in Cuba we have this opportunity since DEP
Nation is, at last, a big sosial Laboratory where profound changes are
being offered to the investigative mind, great possibilities that if
not taken in consideration would be hopelessly lest.
As it can be observed, the social study is limited to these
pesuliar spects not only of our tradition but of the changes escurring
in our country, as well as the consequent psychological modifications
that will be evidenced in our Sympesia.
Besides the three Departments, the Institute has four Sections:
Electronics, Statistics, Billegraphy and Publications.
at the
At this moment, the personnel working at the Institute is as
follows: 8 Professors, 6 auxiliarios, 3 paychologists, 6 teannicians,
2 statisticians, 1 anthropologist, 6 students in Neurophysiology, 6 in
Psychology, and 6 in Secial Psychology.
As a final aspiration, there is the pessible unification of the
efforts carried out by our three Departments so we can reach our geal
1.e., the inter-disciplinary studies made in fields unknown up to how,
an aspiration maintained by these interested in these subjects.
the
Thus,
we are working in two lines of investigation: "Material and moral
insentives in productivity", and "Hotivation in a Cuban religious group"
To sum it m the objective of our Institute is the study of the
neurophysiologis and psychological levels as well as that of the social
espects that might be of interest in our country, trying within the
11igh of our methods of investigations to attain the inter-disciplinary
integration of these disciplines.
We are now in the presers of organising
organising a Cortico-Visceral Activi-
ties or Paychosomatic Laboratory in connection with a Psychiatric Clinis.
Another Laberatory on Psychopharmeals and Behavier keeping the Applied
Psychology one in which I will continue with my studies of participant
variables in the Physician-Patient relationship in Psychotherapy. In
7 15 of this late, June, 1967, the latter was dropped.

In the 2nd. year, we explain General Psychology in order to give
the necessary preparation for an adequate application of Medical Psychology.
In the 3rd. year, we invade the field of Propedeutics and participate
with these teachers adding the psychological and social factors in the
elinical hystory, the study of Payeholegical factors in the interview, the
physician-patient relationship, the psychological reaction of the somatie
patient and the somatic repercussions of the emotional disturbances.
In the 4th year, we realize a similar task, but as it is natural,
in a mere specialised manner in Surgery and Obstetrica, and in 5th year
in Pediatrics, adding the necessary Social Psychology elements in Pre-
ventive Medicine to carry out a competent sanitary campaign..
The sixth year is dedicated to the rotating internship system.
The Department of Psychiatry explains Peychiatric Propedeuties in
3rd. and 4th years, and Clinical Psychiatry in 3th.
Our Department tegether with the Psychiatric Department for residents
in Psychiatry explains the Heurophysiologic and Paychelegical aspects and
in the post-graduate term dedicates three years for them to besase
specialistu.
▲ comme on Psychotherapy is being organised for the post-graduates
se mu to create psychotherapeutista.

Dr. P. C. Redlich
reference to this last work, I wish to state that Ihave finiated ita
first stage.
The Institute has organised and convened an International Neuro-
physislegy Symposium which took place in February, 1965, in Havana wie}:
was attended by many Neurophysiologiste of international fume (like
Asratyán, Purpura, Rey John, Grastyán, Bures, Kagan, Lifschits, Lissak,
Mancia, etc.) and is organising an International Psychology Symposium
for February, 1968 with the following theme: * Motivation: its neure
physiological, psychological and social aspects. Perspective of its
integration". &
We have inaugurated a new sestiem called Transcultural Studies
which works in connection with the Transcultural Psychiatric Commission
of the Cuban Society of Psychiatry.
"
For the beginning of next year I will begin to publish a Revicu
called Transcultural Psychiatry and which will be the official organ of
the Transcultural Paychiatry Commission of the Cuban Seciety of Psychiatry.
and the Trangenltural Studies Section of the Institute, where we will
have a resund and comments in Spanish of all the papers published in this
subject in the warld and later on we will include our own works.
Enslesed please find my paper on "Learning and Drugs" which I road
at the XVIII International Congress of Psychology in Moscow, and the one

In relation to the Department of Medical Psychology of the Faculty
of Medicine at the University of Havana, we started to work in 1961 after
making some changes at the University which, among other things, created
this Department.
We began with a theoretic practical course in the 3rd year of Medi
eine but we undertook all the opportune negotiations with the academic
authorities to carry out such a transformation.
Our opinion is that Medical Psychology must be taught in parallel
manner to the disciplines all along the career until the absurd dualism
that today offers adequate somatic preparation but very weak psychological
preparation is overcome.
Last year in agreement with the Faculty and after constant efforts
we obtained and put in practice the following activity:
In the 1st. year, our Department carries out a study of the persona¨
lity and inclinations of all the students who are registered making inter-
views and tests which are repeated later in the 5th year.
date of the Symposium has been moved to 24-30 ar November, 1968.

No he tenido respuesta a esta carta todavía, pero sí recibí una nota
de él donde me decía que había estado varios meses fuera de Francia.
Ahora bien yo creo que lo mejor es que cambiemos impresiones los tres
por correo antes de llegar a la reunión en Noviembre en Lima pues allí
nos vamos a poner de acuerdo los latinoamericanos sobre dicho problema.
Beguin estara allí, tú no debes faltar y yo voy a hacer todo lo posi-
ble por ir.
Claro que hay cátedras de Psicología Médica en Argentina, Venezuela,
Colombia y tal vez otras más, pero el desarrollo que hemos logrado en
Peru, México y Cuba por nuestros respectivos esfuerzos todo el mundo
reconoce y de no saberlo lo acepta en cuanto se le informs.
Por ello es que creo que es importante que cambiemos impresiones los
tres antes de llegar a Noviembre, para llegar a Lima con perspectivas
de una línea adecuada.
Luego debemos demandar de los norteamericanos y de Pichot y los Europeos
un cambio de impresiones o indicérselo a la OMS como acuerdo de nuestra
reunion en Lima.
Con los mejores deseos para ti y un fuerte abrazo, se despide tu amigo,

Aprovechando un nuevo viaje del amigo V_risco te escribo otra vez para
saluderte y darte unos informes que cre8 de importancia.
También le estoy escribiendo a Seguín y Dávila. Les hago saber a todos
que en el mes de Julio saldrá el primer numero de nuestra Revista Psi-
quiatria Transcultural de la cual les enviaré un ejemplar tan pronto
salga.
En el mes de Noviembre se ha de celebrar una reunión de la Organiza-
ción Sanitaria Panamericana sobre la "Enseñanza de la Psicologia Médi-
ca y la Psiquiatria en América," a la que pienso asistir pues ha sido
invitada la Facultad de Medicina de la Universidad de la Habana por la
organización y la Facultad casi con toda seguridad me ha de designar,
en ese caso no tendría problemas pues ellos se ocupan de conseguir la
visa y de todos los demás detalles relacionados con la reunión.
En el mes de Enero le escribí una extensa carta a Pichot que en el
Congreso de Madrid estuvo tratando de producir una reunión de los
asistentes al mismo que se dedican a la Psicologia Médica.
Yo recibí su citación con gran entusiasmo pues creo que es necesario

ya que cada uno de dicho grupo tenemos nuestra propia opinión como
son sin duda las tres opiniones que rigen en el mundo en esta materia.
Él por su parte nos defraudó tanto a mi como a Seguin pues realizó
uns reunion intrascendente y se puso en contacto con gente que no re-
presenta la Psicologia Médica en el mundo y por ejemplo, concretamen-
te en relación al Perú, entro en contacto, no con Seguin que estaba
allí, sino con un muchacho que no se dedica a esta disciplina.
Esa es la razón por la cual le escribí esa carta haciéndole esas crí-
ticas y sugiriendole que para tratar de esos problemas con nosotros
latinoamericanos tenian fundamentalmente que entrar en contacto con-
tigo, con Seguín y conmigo pues creo fuera de toda falsa modestia que

Querido Amigo y Compañero:
Aprovechando la oportunidad que me brinda los Laboratorios Erba de
escribir a los amigos de Latino América a través de ellos es que te
hago estas líneas. A partir de ahora dirige el sobre a ellos a la
dirección siguiente: Apartado 21909, Mexico 21, D.F., Mexico, y la
carta a mí. Una vez que ellos abren el sobre y ven que está diri-
gida a mí, me la trae personalmente un representante de la casa en
sus viajes entre nuestro país y Mexico. Así podemos estar seguros
de una vía que no crea problemas pues tú escribes a Mexico y te
llegan las míae de Mexico. Gracias a esto es que te estoy enviando
el Tomo I de mi libro "Psicología Médica”.
Te hago saber que en el mes de Julio saldrá el primer número de
nuestra Revista Psiquiatría Transcultural de la cual te enviaré un
ejemplar por la misma vía.
Te estoy enviando un ejemplar de los trabajos que a continuación rela-
ciono: "Aprendizaje y Drogas", trabajo que lef en el Simposio "Psico-
farmacología y Regulación de la Conducta" en el XVIII Congreso Inter-
nacional de Psicología, Moscú; el trabajo que oiste en Madrid, "Fac-
tores Culturales con Cuadro Clínico Esquizofrénico"; "Importancia de
la Psicología Médica en la Formación del Nuevo médico", trabajo que
ha sido traducido al Alemán y será publicado por la Universidad de
Halle-Wittemberg, Alemania; "La Enseñanza de la Psicología Médica
en Cuba", que ha sido traducido al Búlgaro y será publicado en la
Revista "Savremena Medicina" en Sofía, Bulgaria; así como el último
número del Boletín del Instituto. El Boletín a partir del próximo
número saldrá cada tres meses, y estando ya en imprenta el número de
Julio tan pronto salga te enviaré un ejemplar.
Deseo hacerte sobor que le envié a Stanley Lesse mi trabajo "Psiquia-
tría en Cuba", igual al que tu enviaste correspondiente al Perú, el
cual debe estar al salir en el American Journal of Psychotherapy.
Está al salir también mi libro "La Enseñanza de la Psicología Médica

Pues bien, debemos escribirnos los tres (lo estoy haciendo también a
Millán) para llegar a Lima con perspectivas de una línea adecuada.
Luego debemos demander de los norteamericanos y de Pichot y los Europees
un cambio de impresiones o indicárselo a la OMS como acuerdo de nuestra
reunión en Lima.
Espero de todos modos la respuesta de Pichot, pues estuvo fuera de Paris
y ahora recibí nota de él.

Por otra parte, creo que nosotros tres (tý, Dévila y yo) tenemos la res-
ponsabilidad de llevar adelante la comision de Estudios Transculturales
de la Asociación Psiquiátrica de la América Latina en unión de Kelly y
Marconi.
Voy a confeccionar un proyecto de actividades y se lo voy a enviar a
Dávila y a tí te enviare una copia.
De todos modos le escribi a Leigh, el Secretario de la Asociación Hun-
dial de Psiquiatría pidiéndole se creara una Comisión o sección de Psi-
quiatria Transcultural en la Asociación Mundial de Psiquiatria.
Espero que ahora me podrás escribir sin problemas e infórmame de tas

We would appreciate an early answer from you about this so we
can begin the necessary arrangements.
As for your information about publishing a version of my letter
to you on activities at the Institute is all right with me. In fact,
I consider it a great honor to tell your readers about us.
I am happy to know that you have received and read my paper on
"Cultural Pactors in Hysterias with Schizophrenic Clinical Pictures.
For my part, I will let you know that I have read your monography
published in the April 1966 number of the American Journal of Psycho-
therapy. I found it extremely interesting and was glad to know that
there is more to come on this subject.
Thank you for your kind words about my book on Medical Psycho-
logy. The one you received is Vol. I; Vol. II will be out in August,
and I am working on Vol. III. As soon as Vol. II is out, I will mail
you a copy.
Three of the scientists that have already accepted to come to
the Symposium visited the Institute this year. One of them was Dr.
Vladimir D. Nebylitsyn, Vice-Director of the Institute of Psychology
from Moscow, who stayed two months with us. He helped us to create
a typology laboratory in our Psychology Department. At the same time
he offered a course on topology variables according to Teplov and
himself.
He works principally studying personality. His conception is
primarily based in the human brain properties that were discovered
by Pavlov and later on were developed by Teplov and his collaborators.
Dr. Nebylitsyn, as well as other investigators, have developed
some scientific methods on the investigation of such properties of
the nervous system and their studies nowadays can very well be
correlated with certain personality dimensions. It has been thus
proven by some investigators abroad and today, in Cuba, we need to
begin developing such scientific methods.
We also had Dr. E. Roy John, from the New York Medical College,
who spent a month here. Following is a brief resumé of his activities
at the Institute.
In the mornings, Dr. John gave a lecture on physiology of
learning, having memory as a basic theme, explained every possible
way, psychological, physiological, biochemical and anatomically.
The lecture was discussed by those attending, and experimental so-
lutions were proposed for various problems not yet resolved. The text
book used in this course was written by Dr. John himself and will be
out of print by now.

The information below was acquired through
interrogation of CC-4033, Dr. Hector WILTZ Lancis, a Cuban
refugee and former resident of Nuevo Vedado, Habana, who left
Cuba on 19 March 1969 and has been a professional colleague
of Subject for many years.
a. Dr. Jose *BUSTAMENTE O'Leary, psychiatrist,
was brought up by his aunts; he does not know the
identity of his mother. He, together with Raul Roa,
Justo Carrillo, and others, comes from the ranks of
the left wing of the student movement; he joined the
Communist Party of Cuba in 1938 and, in 1944, supported
presidential candidate Dr. Carlos Saladrigas in the
presidential elections held that year. When Dr. Grau
was elected President, Subject concentrated on his
professional activities, earning considerable pres-
tige and acquiring a good practice, while maintaining
his political relationships with senators, colonos,
etc. In 1952, the year of the coup d'etat, Dr. Bustamente
had such friendly relations with both presidential
candidates that, if the general elections scheduled
for June 1952 had been held, Subject would have been
made (a) Vice-Minister of Foreign Relations if Dr. Agramonte
had been elected, and (b) Minister without cartera
(portfolio) if Dr. Hevia had been elected.

Dear Dr. Kiev:
I received yours of May 17 a few days ago and I thank
you for the information..

First of all, I wish to acknowledge receipt of your book,
"Magic, Paith and Healing Studies in Primitive Psychiatry
Today", for which I am grateful. It is most interesting and I
am reading it with great pleasure.

I want you to know that in July a new Review called
Transcultural Psychiatry will be published here. We are editing
it and it will be the first of its kind in our language.
soon as it is out, I will mail you a copy. This Review will be
the official organ of the Transcultural Psychiatry Commission of
the Cuban Society of Psychiatry and the Cuban Group of Trans-
cultural Studies in which a resumé, translation or comments in
Spanish of all the works written the world over will be published.
Later on, it will become the publication media for the Cuban
Society of Psychiatry works, as well as those written by the Trans-
cultural Psychiatry Section of the Institute, gathering in it all
Cuban publications and giving opportunity too to some Latin
American scientists' papers, but always keeping comments, trans-
lation or resume of other Reviews. At the beginning, the Review
will appear every 6 months, but later on it will be a quarterly.
We have an Anthropologist working with us at the Institute
now, Dr. Antonio Santa Cruz, a Yale graduate, and we are planning
a joint book on Transcultural Psychiatry, since there is not a
treatise in Spanish on this subject that I know of. I will let
you know as to its development.

Dear Dr. Lesse:
June 9, 1967
I have received your letter of April 21 for which I thank you.
As of now I am inviting you in the name of the Institute and
the Academy of Sciences of Cuba to our next International Symposium
of Psychology which will take place on 24-30 of November in 1968.
So far we have received acceptance letters from the following
soientists: two from Italy, Dr. Ancona and Dr. Marzi; one from
Hungary, Dr. Grastyán; one from the G.D.R., Dr. Hiebsch; one from
Belgium, Dr. Nuttin, one from Checoslovaquia, Dr. Buresova; one
from France, Dr. Gastaut; four so far from your country, Doctors
Roy John, Littig, Mansonn and Klausner; we also have four from the
Soviet Union at this moment, Doctors Roitbak, Zotowa, Oshanin and
Hebylitsyn.
The guests' stay will be borne by the Academy of Sciences,
and we have made arrangements to cover your trip Mexico-Ravana-
Mexico. Unfortunately, we won't be able to pay for the New York-
Mexico trip due to the dollar situation, something I regret very
much.
If you can arrange to be with us then I wish you would send me
the title of your work. The Symposium will accept papers in three
languages, English, French and Spanish. Your work could be on motiva-
tion in psychotherapy, or any other subject you may have in mind as
long as it deals with motivation. It can either be a neurophysiologio,
social or a psychological theme. Once your paper has been accepted,
it should be in our hands by May 31, 1968, and its length should be
about 30 minutes.
discussion on your work by all concerned. As you can see, you have
After your paper has been read, there will be a
a year from the moment this Symposium is convened up to the time of
presentation of your paper which we believe is sufficient.
It would give me a great pleasure if you could come a week
earlier or stayed a week after the Symposium to give a course at the
Institute, or a month if it is possible. The Academy will take care
of the expenses.

We have had three scientists visiting the Institute this year.

Department. At the same time, he offered a course on typology
variables according to Teploy and himself.
He works principally studying personality. His conception is
primarily based in the human brain properties that were discovered
by Pavlov and later on were developed by Teplov and his collaborators.
Dr Nebylitsyn, as well as other investigators, have developed
some scientific methods on the investigation of such properties of
the nervous system and their studies nowadays can very well be
correlated with certain personality dimensions. It has been thus
proven by some investigators abroad and today, in Cuba, we need to
begin developing such scientific methods.
We also had Dr. B. Roy John, from the New York Medical College,
who spent a month here. Following is a brief resumé of his activities
at the Institute.
In the mornings, Dr. John gave a lecture on physiology of
learning, having memory as a basic theme, explained every possible
way, psychological, physiological, biochemical and anatomically.
The lecture was discussed by those attending, and experimental
solutions were proposed for various problems not yet resolved.

observing cats with alimentary reflex. The third one was in influence
of specific and unspecific structures of the Central Nervous System
on learning. Stimulations of different specific structures and of
reticular watching the importance of the facilitation of this mechanism,
The fourth experiment was a study with microelectrodes of neuronal
activity changes during the learning stage in cronic animals.
Both Dr. Nebyliteyn and Dr. John dictated very interesting
conferences at the Academy of Sciences' Conference Hall and at the
Scientific Council of the Ministry of Public Health.
At the moment, we have Dr. E. Grastyán, from the University of
Pece, Hungary, who will leave soon after collaborating with the Depart-
ment of Psychology for two months. He has been working on motivation
and cooperating in a joint work for our coming Symposium.

conferences at the Academy of Sciences' Conference Hall and at the
Scientific Council of the Ministry of Public Health.
At the moment, we have Dr. E. Grastyan, from the University
of Pees, Hungary, who will leave soon after collaborating with the
Department of Psychology for two months. He has been working on
motivation and cooperating in a joint work for our coming Symposium.
I told you in my previous letter that I was receiving your
Journal because the dues had been paid, but I just found out that
because of the dollar situation my subscription was not renewed,
something I am unable to help. If at all possible I would like
you to do the following:
We are publishing a Bulletin for the Institute, and as of next
July, the first number of a Review called Transcultural Psychiatry,
the first of its kind in Spanish, will be out. I beg of you that,
apart from sending you news about Cuba from time to time to be
published in your Journal, to please accept as an exchange these two
Reviews for your Journal, otherwise, I could not guarantee to receive
it periodically. Thus, I am proposing an official exchange of both
Reviews until this abnormal situation can be remedied, because the
Journal is very important to me.
:
Please refer to my letter of March 27 as to the fastest way
of communication between us. This will reach you via the same
person. However, please address the Journal to the Institute address:
Loma y 37, Alturas del Vedado, Havana, Cuba.
I will be waiting for your news.
With best wishes, I am,
Cordially yours,

Just today I received the 1966 Report on Activities of the Inter-
national Committee Against Mental Illness, also, I got the picture
taken during the luncheon in Madrid, for which I thank you.
Reading the Report I noticed there is a Bulletin de Centre de
Psychiatrie et de Neurologie in Haiti. I would like to receive copy
or copies of numbers that have already appeared. I do not know exactly
where to write, or to whom address the letter, so will you kindly take
care of this for me.
Also, I am interested in the International Journal of Psychiatry
published in Boston, which I would like to receive too. You could give
them my name with the Institute address so they can send me the copies.
To both these Reviews you can tell them that since I am Director of
both the bulletin of the Institute and the new Review of Transcultural
Psychiatry I am officially proposing an exchange for their Review, or
else they can tell me what they want me to do.
Incidentally, I wish to call your attention to the fact that the
Institute's name now is Instituto de Neurofisiología y Psicología, not
Instituto de Investigaziones de la Actividad Nerviosa Superior, as the
aforementioned Report was addressed. The address was correct, Loma y
37, Alturas del Vedado, Havana, Cuba.
I think I should let you know that I have written to Dr. D. Leigh,
Secretary to the World Psychiatric Association and among other things
I indicated the convenience to create one Committee or Section of Trans-
cultural Psychiatry within the World Psychiatric Association because
this is a rather new and multi-disciplinary field (comprising psychia-
trists, psychologists, anthropologists, etc.) requiring more than any
other one the cooperation and help to facilitate the efforts to keep
producing and offering contributions in the development of this field.

I have secured a better way to get our mail and it consists of
the following: address your envelope to Laboratorios Erba, Apartado
21909, Mexico 21, D.P., Mexico, and the letter to me. Once they open
the letter and see it is addressed to me, a member of the laboratory
will bring it personally to me as they travel back and forth between
our countries. I will address my letters to you and they will mail
them in Mexico to you. In this way, we are both sure our mail will
not get lost since I have absolute confidence in them. -
I am taking this opportunity to send you my book, "Medical Psycho-
logy", in three volumes of which this is Vol. I,
I think I have covered everything of interest to you.
Hoping to hear from you soon, and with best wishes, I am,
JAB/el

Querido Compañero:
Aprovechando un nuevo viaje del amigo Varisco le escribo otra vez
para saludarlo y darle una pequeña información, pero primeramente
deseo que al recibo de esta se encuentre Ud. bien de salud.
También le estoy escribiendo a Seguín y Millán, Les hago saber a
todos que en el mes de Julio saldrá el primer número de nuestra Re-
viste Psiquiatría Transcultural de la cual les enviaré un ejemplar
tan pronto salga.
Yo creo que nosotros tres, (Seguin, Ud. y yo) tenemos la responsa-
bilidad de llevar adelante la Comisión de Estudios Transculturales
de la Asociación Psiquiátrica de la América Latina en unión de Kelly
y Marconi.
Meditando sobre este asunto he pensado que sería bueno escribir un
proyecto de actividades y se lo enviaré para que Ud. lo estudie y
me dé su opinión. Le escribiré a Seguin dándole un esquema del mis-
mo.
De todos modos, deseo informarle que le escribi a Leigh, el Secre-
tario de la Asociación Mundial de Psiquiatria pidiéndole se crea-
ra una comisión o sección de Psiquiatria Transcultural dentro de la
misma Asociación.
Sin más por el momento, y con un afectuoso saludo quedo de Ud.,
Afectuosamente,
DE CRENC +5
