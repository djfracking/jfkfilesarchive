CUBAN INDEPENDENCE DAY
HON. WILLIAM C. CRAMER
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OP REPRESENTATIVI
Wednesday, May 29, 1970
Mr. CHAMER Mr. Speaker, May 20 is
a very spend day for Cubans and Amar-
seans. On that date in 1902, the Cuban
Army. They have consistently fumat
freedom from oppression and Nieir battle
for halerendence from 18555 to 1892 found
The Unurst States a thung eletriade of
them.
But we cannot förist that the Cubans
so loved liberty that the mummters of
casinities in their two wars of indeperde
ence mounted to a quarter of a million
people. The total population of the island
at that time was less that Brillion.
What this means is that one out of
every four Cubans beame casualties in
their quest for therty:
True, the State Department appres
keak Cuban extles.ón the grounda that
Jomags from the Cluted States are in
violation of our neutrality laws. But I
would like to eite an interpretation of
thase neutzakty laws as rendered by the
late Robeit Kennedy when he was Attor
ney General of the United States.
This ruling was that the neutrality laws
were, ana i quɔite:

of situation which exist, in the world today
The late Attorney General continued
and I quate from his April 20, 1961
ruline:

It shameful to say that the United
Sier seems to have turnej na back on
Cuba when it is suffering from the in-
position et an ather foretan tyranný, un
ternational commum headed by the
Soviet Union. Yet, State Department
spokesman Robert McClosky, a holdover

My collenme, Senator Sint abo was made in the cause of our
Moss, has already brought this to thoat-
teation of the Senate. It is iny wish to
brate it to the attention of say euliearues
in the House of itepresentatives and the
American public.
We amount of rabotage betur com
mitted by Cübnan Inside Cuba is in line
with the tradition of its people. Just

From what O'Donnell has been able to piece together from
meetings and discussions with Alpha 66 members, he believes another
raid attempt into Cuba will take place in about four-five months.
He will continue to apprise us of what he learns.

DATE: 16 October 1970
SUBJECT: Alpha 66 Activities in Los Angeles Areas
:
REF.:
Your Speed Letter of 6 Oct 70, Same Subject
1. In a 13 Oct 70 interview with Johnny O'Donnell, free-lance
reporter, he made the following information available regarding
subject matter: The head man is Miguel Talleda, who is employed
as an accountant at Hammer of California, Gardena. He has four
daughters, two sons, and his wife baby-sits for neighbors in order
to earn extra money. He receives about $1,000 a month. Talleda
appears to be honest, hard-working, well disciplined and well
organized, not overly emotional, strongly anti-Communist and anti-
Castro. According to the Los Angeles Police Department, he has a
P.O. Box in his name in Alhambra. The No. 2 man is Nextor Aranguren,
also an accountant. He lives in Alhambra, and is believed to be the
"bag man" who handles all money collected by the organization. It
is the custom of Alpha 66 to inform their supporters how much money
they receive. The rally in April 1970 at the Embassy Auditorium in
Los Angeles netted them approximately $2,200.
"
2: One of the staunch supporters of Alpha 66 is a Dr. (fnu)
DeCespedes, PhD, the granddaughter of Carlos Manuel DeCespedes, the
Father of the Cuban independence who fought against the Spanish in
1868. She spoke at the Maywood American Legion Post Alpha 66 Rally
in August 1970.
3.
Eligio
The following are Southern California city delegates:
Vichot from Redondo Beach; Lorenzo Alfonso, from Fullerton, their
most fiery speaker, who owns a janitorial service business; Pedro
Sanchez from Culver City; Marcos Peralta, Huntington Park. Sanchez,
Peralta, and Talleda flew to San Francisco with top man Andreas Nazario
Sargeant of Miami when he visited Los Angeles in August 1970.
- 4.0
O'Donnell said the Alpha 66 training camp is somewhere in
Mexico but they may move it to Central America as the Cubans are
worried that the Mexicans might sell them out.

Your memo dtd 23 Oct 70, same subject
1. Subsequent interviews with Johnny O'Donnell resulting from
reference, disclosed he has had no personal contact with the Alpha 66
group in the last two months due to personal financial reasons. He
said his funds are depleted and he has had to spend all of his time
looking for publishers that will pay for his contributions. He was
As
unable to answer the questions posed in reference at this time.
soon as he gets on his feet financially he will again make contact
with the group and try to learn more. He feels he has the complete
confidence of the group; they are looking to him for publicity, i.ė.,
"to tell it like it is."
.
2. O'Donnell said as far as "funding channels" are concerned,
Alpha 66 does its own fund raising, such as with rallies, dinners,
and "nickel and dime" contributors. He does not know of any single
big money contributor.
3. Any information regarding Alpha 66 that comes to the atten-
tion of Mr. O'Donnell, will be passed along to us by him.

1.
LA 288-71
DATE: 25 February 1971.
Periodic checking with Johnny O'Donnell regarding his con-
tacts with Alpha 66 people has proved negative. O'Donnell is
hurting financially, as reported in LA 1024-70, and he is trying
to earn a living by writing articles for various publications. He
feels his first concern is to his family (a pregnant wife), so he
is devoting his time to anything that will pay off. He is not
bitter, and said if he does learn anything in the future regarding
the activities of Alpha 66, he will certainly pass it along, but he
will not go out to get it at this time.
2. It is our belief that nothing more from O'Donnell will be
forthcoming. Please close. We know of no other sources.

Las informaciones quellegan de muestra Patría aseguran un estado intente
de réboldía, actividades de cabotages olentos y pasives, inconformidad en los
dickbros de las eras armadas, grandes preocupac os en las esferas del go-
bionno y un malestar general en el pueblo cubano,
No hay dudas que el Flan de Alpha 66 contribuye en alguna proporción a es..
tos fenómenos. Primero anunciamos el desembarco de Vicento Méndez antes del 31

Gente que llego a tierras cuburas, despaña de 1961.
En mayo, hombres del Alpha 66 hundieron 2 embarciones cubanas e hicieron 11
· prisioneros comunistas, repitiendo otra conmoción Mundial que motivó el escandalo
mayor esconificado por el traidor Fidel Castro y su mayor derreta moral do los úl-
tizos tiempos. El gran triunfo lo consigna el pueblo do Cuba en distintos infor
nos que poseemos de muestras células clandestinas.
Otros movimientos positivos de distintas índoles se produjeron, unes con d
to y otros frustados por las autoridados norteamericanas; però en fin todos destina-
dos a golpear duramente al tirano y alentar y respaldar a los hombres de las mon-
talas y los grupos clandestinos que se juegan todos los dias sus vidas en aras de
la libertad.
Con estos antecedentes de gran valor y valides, amén de mas de 20 acciones co-
mandos y de infiltraciones reninzadas por nuestros mms destrendos hombres y por
ura pleyade de patriotas que combatieron y combaten en todos los frentes de con
cubana, nos sentimos moralmente respaldados para promover un llamamiento on pene-
ral a los cubanos de la Isla a los cubanos del dustierro, a la guerra libertado-
ra. No pretendemos convertirnos en sectaristas, sino que cada cual que empañia el
arma que tenga, la actividad que sea compatible a sus posibilidades, la colabora
ción economica y el apoyo moral, a los que combaten y sobre todo, a los que en la
Isla dan la pauta y llevan el mayor peso en la contienda. Sin demora teneños que
a cometer acciones vitales para que éste gran momento historico ciaje en la libera-
ción definitiva de Cuba.
Ademas de coordinar las cuestiones internas con otros grupos clandestinos,
Alpha 66 esta distrubuyendo cientos de millares de pequeños panfleticos convidan-
do a las milicias,ak Ejercito Rebelda y al pueblo a participar de la contienda en
contra del Castro-Comunismo. Todos los cubanos que deseen cooperar a este lama-

enviar a Cuba. Cada cubano puede servir de puente entre los de dentro y de fuera,
Por último, demandames de todos los cubanos y de las organizaciones que pase-

causa cubana. 10 requieren los hombres y mujeres que en las carecles costienen la
gallarda rebeldía nacional, los combatientes de todos los frentes y el pueblo en
clavizado. Rongamos la tragedia de nuestro pueblo por encima de merginos intere--

ALPHA 66 INFORMA:
Reportes que nos llegan desde nuestras células militantes dentro de Cuba, determinan
que las acciones iniciadas por nuestra Organiunción, que cr. una de sus etapas culminó
con el desembarco aul Coronel Vicente Méndez el 17 de Abril en Criente, estan tenien-
do repercusión en otras provincias de la isla.
No es sólo en Criente donde las fuerzas internas han respondido al estímulo exterior
representado por las acciones de Alpha 66; en Camagüey, por ejemplo, se han produci-
do reiterados brotes de rebeldía traducidos en sabotajes, resistencia y en algunes
casos enfrentamiento directo con el régimen.
La situación en Oriente, desde luego, es la que revela con mayor claridad la decisión
del pueblo cubano de sacudirse el yugo que lo oprime. A tal extremo que los propios
medios de publicidad del Gobierno comunista de Cuba han tenido que informar sobre
se debe a "movi-
"grandes concentraciones de las Fuerzas Armadas", en ásos sectores
lizaciones para incrementar la producción", cuando lo cierto es que la fracasada za-
fra de los 10 millones, ya prácticamente ha terminado.
Las movilizaciones no han tenido otro objeto, según los reportes que hemos recibido,
que frenar la ola de deserciones que se han venido produciendo en las films de ins
que actúan eficazmente los patriotas eu-
Fuerzas Armadas y cubrir territorios en los
banos.
Que el régimen de Castro está consciente de la gravedad del momento lo demuestra en-
tre otras cosas, la intensa purga que se está llevando a cabo en las más altas esse-
la cesantía fulminante de José Llamed, sono
ras del Gobierno, y que comentaron con
Ministro de Educación y Francisco ladron, como Ministro de in Industria Acucarera.
Los desplazamientos de distintos elementos de les importantes cargos que venían sou-
pando continuan especialmente en los "Estates Mayores" de las Fuerzas Armadas. À tal
extremo, de que se da por segun la destitución del Comandante Guillermo Careft Prías,
Jefe cel Partido Comunistra en in provincia de Oriente, quien ha caído en "Desgracia"
debido a su importancia para contener a les invasores de Alpha 66 y a los elementos
que en ésa provincia se han sumado a las
acciones.
Este estado de cosas ha llegado a tal situación explosiva, que se esperan en el sur-
so de lo que resta de este mes importantes acontecimientos que daran un giro favora-
ble a la rebeldía cubana frente al régimen despotico que ocupa el poder.
Ese es en síntesis, el resumen de los informes que hemos recibido donde giguran dates
aún más concretes que de revelarse pormenorizadamente, pudieran acarrear graves peli-
gros a elementos que actuan activamente en esas dos provincias mencionadas.

"non-policy' toward Cul
On April 17 (the anniversary of the
1961 Bay of Pigs fiasco) the Cuban exile
military organization Alpha-66 landed
13 commandos on the east coast of Cuba.
They allegedly were captured, but if so
only after Fidel Castro threw an esti
mated 25,000 troops into the fray. Cas-
tro lost several men as well,
Then on May 6,Alpha-66 "naval units"
sank, in Cuban waters, two of Castro's
high-scas fishing trawlers (used, as well,
for spying and infiltrating guerrillas into
Latin America).
These two actions set off a chain of
events in Washington that would have
done credit to the LBJ and JFK Ad-
ministrations. With Castro massing his
mobs for a circus of protest, the State,
Department hit the panic button and on
May 13 called together representatives
of federal law enforcement agencies to
figure out ways to protect Castro from
further forays of this nature.
What really teed-off the State Depart-
ment was a momentary aberration by
Alpha-66 to trade 11 crew members of
the fishing vessels for the freedom of
survivors of the April 17 landing. They
soon thought better of it and sent a tele-
gram to the Red Cross giving the loca-
tion of the men and asking that they be
returned to Cuba,
'CIA Invasion"
Meanwhile, Castro staged a demon-
stration in front of the former U.S. Em-
bassy in Havana, which is now being
used by the Swiss government. He
charged the Swiss, who represent U.S.
interests in Cuba, with complicity in
what he called a "CIA invasion'

The demonstration was also used to
"welcome" the turningshermen,
who were soon
at the airport in
Havana. Out the hermen were late
in arriving.
They were te Que to an unforeseen
need to change thing. When Alpha-
65 rescued the news from the sinking
vessels (turned around, Castro would
have had them shot as he has ordered
the shooting of thousands seeking to
leave his is
small bouts), they
found them literally in rags.
Shoes were patched with palin bark;
shirts and trousers were in titters. So,

vided the men with shees and new deth-

Back in Miami, federal in
ag
acti
on State Department interpretation on
antiquated neutrality laws entered Alpha-
65 headquarters. The search warrant
alleged that there was evidence that
1) Alpha-66 had launched its attacks
from U.S. territory; 2) Cubans were
raising funds illegally for bellicone pur-
poses; and 3) all of this was being done
to attack a nation with which the U.S
is "at peace, to wit: Cuba."
Of the 37 items impounded, those of
military significance were "one large
carton filled with military-type web
equipment...one military-type field
pack...and one farge cardboard carton
filled with plastic military-type can-
tecas. With such evidence, Army.
Navy surplus stores could be indicted.
Greater attention was given to files
containing the names of contributors.
These held special interest because the
wording in the warrant found “financial
contributions and disbursements to ob
tain boats and other supplies" possibly
prosecutable.
Can the State Department be
serious? If this section of the law
were applied Impartially, how many
Jens nould today be under indict-
ment for openly soliciting funds for
the purchase of bellicose materials
for a foreign nation—Israel?
How many senators and congressmen
would today have egg on their faces
for participating in fund-raising func-
ions, publicly organized and propagan-
lized, for that very purpose? That is how
he Cuban community sees the matter.
This author has no particular objcc-
ion to fund-raising by Jewish groups in
he United States. Cuban exiles certainly
to not. Indeed, Cuban Jews in exile have
contributed substantially to Israci's war
best. They are furious when they, as
Tubant, try to do the same for the libera-
ion of their country, only to find a double
tandard vahed against them. Nor are
hey happy to see their contributions go
own the drain when overzealous federal
fficials seize equipment belonging to
xile groups.
But what blew it for Miami's 350,-
30 Cubans was an "edict" read to them
by the hapless State Department repre-
entative in Miarai.
According to the heads of exile action
coups called to his office, the repre-
entative stressed that "the spirit as
cil as the law” will be upheld. He is
id to have told them that fund-raising
or a bellicose purpose is definitely out-
de the law and warned them not only
ould they be prosecuted should they
unch an attack from the U.S., but
ould also be stopped from using an-
.her Latin American country for that
urpose.

The exact wording in the in
from the State Department
"W
would lie to make it clear that if there
is sufficient evidence of activity d
in the U.S. for any such military gaps
dition, then the fast that a third ceentry
is used as a staging area would not pre-
clude the U.S. from preceding to en
force its laws."
When the story of State Department
policy hit the streets, the Cubans ex-
ploded. Cuban students from the Uni-
versity of Miami and Dade Junior Col
lend (Dade's 26,0%) students comprise
8,000 Cuban studenta) marched on the
Federal Building: 650 Cuban lawyers
challenged the validity of the State Dep
partment position; doctors, dentists.
educators, professional groups-57 of
them-publihed a lengthy statement in
the Diario las Américas newspaper.
Part of that statement reads:
"Title 10. Station 960 of the U.S.
Code (invoked against Alpha-85] pro-
hibits certain actions from being taken
against a nation with which the United
State: is at peace-'s fried by nation.'
Clearly, Fidd Cestra is not at prace
with the United States or mitions of the
Western Hemiphare and, by breaking
diplomatic relations with Cuba on Jan.
3, 1961, the United States recognized
that Cuba is hardly a friendly nation.""

Sen. Strom Thurmond (R...C.)
and Rep. William C. Cramer (R.-Fla.)
strongly support the Cuban exiles in their
interpretation of the law,
The most recent law outlining U.S.
policy toward Cuba was promulgated
and signed by President Kennedy on Cet.
3, 1962. it states that the United States
is "to work with the Organization of
American States and with freedom-
loving Cubans to support the aspirations
of the Cuban people for self-determinn-
tion." Furthermore, the United States
is signatory to four inter-American pacts
and treaties which clearly are designed
to combat Fidel Castro's Communist
regime.

since the Bay of Pigs fallure nine
years ago. Cubans are now thorough-
ly convinced that the State Departe
tent is cut to "get" them and willing
togm; lǝy any subterfuge to do so.
One of these subterfuges, say the exiles.
is a recent indictment against Andrés
Nazario Sarpin, head of Alpha-66,
Sargin is charged with having "con
spired" to purchase arms allegedly stolen
fiɔra a Ú.S. arsenal in Connecticut.
His bail was set at $160,000, then in-
explicably reduced to a mere $2,503
and Sargén asked to plead guilty to be
let off on a light sentence.
These shenanigans, say the Cubars,
mean that fucking proof that "Alpha-
65 launched its attacks from U.S. soil,
the government will use other means
to intimidate exile action groups. Legal
Action taken against Sargin, they argue,
is imply the caper-beaverism on the
part of what they believe to be pro-Cas-
iro functionaries in the Department of
State.
On the other hand, the Department
of State has its care. Many officials are
only slightly less enthusiastic than Cuban
exiles to see the end of Castro's Com-
munist regime. But they argue that the
haif measures taken by Cuban exile
groups are not effective and merely serve
to embarrass the United States, Others
claim that the Alpha-66 attacks were
merely ill-timed, providing Castro with
an "excuse" to lay the failure of his
sugar crop at the feet of "CIA opera-
tives" based in the United States. ·
As to this latter claira, those who know
Fidel Castro also know that he needs no
excuse to gather the mobs and denounce
the United States. The history of his
10 years in power bears full witness to
the truth of this view.
115 Viable Policy
What really comes through in all of
this is that Washington has yet to come
up with a viable policy toward Fidel
Castro to put a stop to his subverting
Latin America and even the United States.
The only absolute factor in the conduct
of foreign affairs is the premium placed
on initiative. We don't have it: Castro
co:s.
The State Department cannot merely

policy of "economic denial and diplo
