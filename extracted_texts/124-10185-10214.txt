Dear Secretary Baker:
The Senate Intelligence Committee, as part of the annual
budget authorization process, will hold a hearing on U.S.
counterintelligence and security programs on May 10, 1990, in
Room SH-219 of the Hart Senate Office Building. We request
that you make available to testify at that hearing Mr. "Ivan
Selin, Undersecretary of State for Management. Other
witnesses invited to testify are FBI Director William S.
Sessions, Mr. Ted Price, the announced successor to Mr.
Gardner Hathaway as CIA Associate Deputy Director for
Operations and head of the CIA Counterintelligence Center;
and Mr. Rich Haver, Special Assistant to the Secretary of
Defense for Intelligence.

We are asking all witnesses to be prepared to discuss
with the Committee the results of the Administration's review
of counterintelligence and security programs for the 1990s,
whether recent changes in the threat and operating
environment require modifying objectives in the 1990s, and
the implications for NFIP and non-NFIP resource allocation,
program direction, and possible legislation. The hearing
will also consider issues identified in testimony from a
group of prominent citizens scheduled for March 22, and we
will be in touch with you further on those matters.
•
We would like Mr. Selin to address in his written
testimony and be prepared to discuss the following questions:
(1) To what extent has political change in the Soviet Union
and Eastern Europe affected their intelligence threat in the
1990s and the requirements for CI operations and security
measures against that threat? (2) To what extent do other
traditional threats, such as the PRC and Cuba, require
greater attention in the 1990s? (3) What are the emerging
threats in the 1990s from third world and "friendly"
intelligence services, as well as narcotics traffickers and
terrorists? (4) What new challenges do technological
advances and transfers to criteria countries and terrorist
-groups pose in the 1990s? (5) What are the consequences of
these changing threats for embassy security priorities and
protection of diplomatic, military, and intelligence secrets?

Re:
SECRET i
Memorandum from M. V. Hale to Mr. S. M. McWeeney
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI)
Request to Discuss the Office of Liaison and
International Affairs (OLIA) and the
Counterintelligence Situation in West Berlin
DETAILS CONTINUED:
As an aside, Mr. Eliff indicated that Allan Kornblum,
Office of Intelligence Policy and Review, Department of Justice,
had visited West Berlin on two occasions and was conversant with
this U. S. military monitoring issue.
Mr. Eliff also stated that he further supported an FBI
presence in West Berlin in that his study of the
counterintelligence venue in that city indicated to him that the
many double agent cases run by the U. S. military there were run
for parochial reasons with no strategic view of
counterintelligence. He stated that even though the U. S.
military services were professional and did coordinate the
turnover of some of their many double agents to the FBI when
these agents are rotated back to domestic assignment, he believed
the FBI should have input at the outset of these double agent
cases insofar as the double agent technique was a fundamental
counterintelligence tool which demanded consultation with the
principle counterintelligence service, the FBI, at their
inception in order to better globally address counterintelligence
issues.
He stated he believed FBI presence in West Berlin would
therefore be necessary if the U. S. were to have a coherent
national counterintelligence strategy..
Mr. Eliff concluded by reiterating his support for the
FBI's presence in West Berlin, by indicating that he would be
willing, were we to ask, to indicate his support of this position
to the USDS, the U. S. military and the CIA as well as Mr. Jeff
Smith, Chief Staffer for Senator Sam Nunn, the latter also well
versed in counterintelligence issues and a potential strong
supporter of the FBI's cause.
Messrs L'Allier, Hooks, and Hale thanked Mr. Eliff for
his time and indicated that the FBI had designated a new
assistant Legal Attache in Bonn whose function would largely be
to travel weekly to West Berlin in order to prepare the FBI's
case for a permanent presence there.

Honorable William Sessions

Washington, D.C. 20535
Dear Director Sessions:
The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence is
conducting a comprehensive review of U.S. counterintelligence
and security programs and capabilities. Included in this
review will be Executive branch efforts to stem the flow of
sensitive technology and equipment to foreign governments.
Recent press reporting has alleged that such transfers
have been made by the military offices of Egypt and Israel.
Accordingly, I request that the FBI brief the Committee staff
on any unauthorized transfer of technology and equipment from
the United States by the Egyptians and by the Israelis. For
the latter, we are particularly interested in any role played
in these transfers by the Israeli Defense Procurement Mission
and Trade Center in. New York.

Sand Boren

Memorandum from M. V. Hale to Mr. S. M. McWeeney
Re: Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI)
Request to Discuss the office of Liaison and.
International Affairs (OLIA) and the
Counterintelligence situation in West Berlin
:
:
DETAILS:
Mr. Hale opened the session, advising Mr. Eliff that, on
his recent trip to Western Europe to visit certain U. S.
Embassies and establishments, including the U. S. Mission in
West Berlin, where Legal Attaches were desired and needed, he had
conferred with appropriate U. S. military, U. S. Department of
State (USDS) and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) personnel in
order to present the FBI's case for representation in
-
West Berlin. During these discussions, Mr. Hale was advised that
staff members of the SSCI had recently visited West Berlin
concerning counterintelligence issues and Mr. Hale, in that
context, wished to brief Mr. Eliff regarding the FBI's
perspectives on opening a Legal Attache, particularly from a
counterintelligence point of view.
Mr. Eliff stated that although he had not recently
visited West Berlin, he was intimately familiar with the
intricacies of the counterintelligence atmosphere in West Berlin
and supported the FBI's presence there. He indicated he was well
aware of the gap which existed in the counterintelligence
coverage of U. S. civilians, both students and businessmen in
that neither the U. S. military nor the U. S. civilian
intelligence intelligence components were addressing the threat
to these individuals and this for two reasons.
i
The first involved the basic functions of the U. S.
intelligence components in West Berlin, a function he described
as being the collection of positive intelligence as opposed to
counterintelligence, the latter being at best a secondary
requirement.

Re:
Memorandum from M. V. Hale to Mr. S. M. McWeeney
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI)
Request to Discuss the Office of Liaison and
International Affairs (OLIA) and the
Counterintelligence Situation in West Berlin
DETAILS CONTINUED:
The second reason for this gap involves the legal
guidelines under which the U. S. military, by virtue of their
authority of an occupying power in West Berlin, conducts
technical surveillance and mail openings. Mr. Eliff stated that,
as an occupying power, the U. S. military, much like the FBI
domestically, is the entity which conducts telephone monitorings
of criteria country establishments and personnel in the U. S.
sector of West Berlin. It also opens certain mail of interest
from the East which passes through this sector. However,
whenever there is an overhear of a U. S. national or whenever
there is mention made of a U. S. national in a piece of
correspondence, that U. S. national's name is not disseminated to
any other U. s. intelligence agency. This lack of dissemination
is as a result of a lawsuit in the early 1970s against the U. S.
Army which, at that time, had in fact been monitoring the
activities of U. S. nationals. As a consequence of this lawsuit,
very stringent guidelines were written which compelled the U. S.
military to use the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to
monitor Americans including stringent guidelines for minimizing
overhears of U. S. nationals when monitoring non U. S. nationals.
The net results of these restrictions is that, according
to Mr. Eliff, 15 years worth of overhears of U. S. nationals as
well as the like potential collection of names of U. S. persons
via mail openings has been lost.
Mr. Eliff advised it was his belief these minimization
restrictions were too stringent and should be amended to allow
for dissemination. He however stated that he thought the issue
should be brought up after the upcoming elections in that he did
not believe a "lame duck" administration would be interested in
undertaking the issue.
