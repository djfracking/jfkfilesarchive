When you met regularly with Mr. Satterswate

Mr. Tweedy.
I am sure we discussed Lumumba in the

African situations, individual African country situations.
We would spend a great deal of time, their points of
view, our point of view, cur perspective, their perspective,

Administration when events in Congo were heating up, after
Congolese independence, what was the general atmosphere in
the State Department and at the CIA in relation to Lumumba,
the general attitude toward Lumumba?

saying what was the general assessment of the situation in
Lumumba was really sort of the last thing you

The worry in Washington about the situation in the
Congo was that here was the largest geographical expression
in Africa that thretened to go up in smoke, up because the
Kremlin was about to march in and take it over, not because
vulnerable to.
it was about to break up tribally and do all the things that
those African countries in their early years were at least
The only trouble with the Congo was if it
happened there the side effects would have been infinitely
greater than, of course, if it had happened anywhere else.
Mr. Baron. What would those side effects have been?
Mr. Tweedy.
All one culd do was assess those, but it
would have set a precedent, for example, the neighboring
country by which great store was set by the West was Nigeria
and if the same infection crossed that border one was afraid
that this would go up in smoke and that in effect there
was a possibility of the continent disintegrating before it
really had had a chance to get under way under its own aegis.

I don't mean to say this was nothing that

This was the concern.
Mr. Baron.
Were these political side effects only
that were being taken into account or were there also
fears for American business interests in the Congo that
were part of the side effects?

Mr. Tweedy.

Insofar as my assessments were concerned,
and those of the Agency and any conversations I can recall
with the State Department, American business was just not a
great factor.
If you want to talk about business, the big factor, of
course, was Katanga and eventually when Tachombe threatened to
succeed resulting in the great involvement of both the U.N. And
the U.S. in the Congo affair, the fear there was that if you
put together the Congo without Katanga it was like construct-
ing a Cadillac and purposely omitting the gas station.
Mr. Baron.
That is because Kutanga is the home of
22

most of the natural resources that are in the Congo.
Mr. Tweedy. That is the only thing that keeps that
country going.
Now, I don't say there weren't a lot of economic con-
siderations in back of that but these were political
economic concerns much more than anything parochial, but is
what was going to happen to U.S. business was not a factor inso-
far as I recall.
Mr. Baron. So the primary concern was for political

posed the threat in the Congo beyond the mere threat of

political instability because of his closeness to the Soviets
or his willingness to accept aid from the Soviets?
Mr. Tweedy. It made the cheese more binding but I
don't think we had any information indicating there was
any close umbilicus between the Soviets and Lumumba but it
was potentially there.
Mr. Baron. And that potential

This increased one's nervousness about the

Mr. Baron. In your capacity as Chief of the African

Mr. Baron. Would you meet regularly with Richard

Mr. Baron. In formulating actions to be taken in the
Congo, would you consult with Bissell before you undertook
any major operation.

Major operation per se, if you are not
talking about just intelligence operations, call for in-

structions and formalization either inside the Agency or out-
side.
Mr. Baron. So any major covert action would be
formulated in consultation not only with Bissell but with the
DCI, Allen Dulles at that time, and probably higher levels
than that.
Mr. Tweedy.
I suppose the DCI, if Bissell felt that
was necessary, and, of course, he used to talk to the
DCI without my being present, and undoubtedly certain instruc-
tions I would receive from time to time undoubtedly stem from
conversations that Bissell would have had with the DCI and
funnelled down to me.
I didn't always know who talked to whom before I
ceived instructions.
Mr. Baron. So if you received an instruction from
Richard Bissell as DDP you would proceed to implement that
instruction on the assumption it was fully authorized above
the level of DDP?
Mr. Tweedy. I think I would proceed with it on the
basis that he was authorized to give me instructions
and it was up to him to bloody well know what he was empowered
to tell me to do.
I couldn't run his affairs for him to that extent, but

Do it, meaning carry off an assassination?
Yes, but it was never discussed with him
in any other sense but a planning exercise, but a planning
exercise which, in other words, never were we instructed
to do anything of this kind. We were instructed to ask whether
such a thing would be feasible and to have the Chief of
Station be thinking along those lines as well.
Mr. Baron. So, in effect you were asked to move
ahead at least as far as developing the capability to
carry of an assassination if an order should be given?
Well, or to examine the potential for

Mr. Dawson. Could you describe that philosophical
difference, or is it describable?
Mr. Tweedy. Well it varied a lot. I think Dick was
by and large inclined to feel that almost anything was
possible, you know, in the clandestine service, if they put
their minds to it, and my view was this wasn't the case.
Mr. Dawson.
Mr. Baron.
Thank you.
Did you ever discuss the question of
assassinating Lumumba with Richard Bissell?
Mr. Tweedy. Yes, this was the way the whole thing
came up in the first instance.
I can't remember how it came
up except undoubtedly we had a conversation.

Mr. Dawson. I know that you have indicated you
won't be able to put a precise date to this conversation

with Bissell or conversations with Bissell, but maybe we can
narrow it down a little bit.
Would you assume that it would be after the proclama-
tion of the Congolese independence on June 30, 19607
Mr. Tweedy. Oh, yes.
Mr. Dawson. Would you assume it would be before
Lumumba's being put into U.N. protective custody on
September15, 19607
Mr. Tweedy. I think it must have been, yes. I
didn't realize he had gone into custody that early.
Mr. Baron. So then it would be sometime during the
summer or early fall of '607
Mr. Tweedy. What happened to Lumumba after that?
Mr. Baron. He was in protective custody at the United
Nations force from mid-September until late November and
it was in late November that he left to go traveling
towards Stanleyville and he was captured by Mobutu's troops
at that point in very early December and from early December
until mid-January he was in the custody of the Congolese in
prison and then it was in mid-January 1961 that he was
flown from a prison in Tysville to Katanga where his death
was announced shortly thereafter.
Mr. Tweedy. That I recall. I have got to assume it

Mr. Baron.
At the time that you were requesting the
Chief of Station to report back on means of gaining access
to Lumumba for the purpose of eliminating him, was this
access made any more explicit in terms of the kind of
personal access that would be needed?
Mr. Tweedy.
I am
sure that must have been covered
at some point,i.e., in perhaps a series of types of accesses.
Mr. Baron. Would this be access to shoot him or would

Mr. Tweedy. That would certainly be my recollection.
Kidnapping was never a factor that I recall at all or even
considered,at least I don't remember it.
Mr. Baron.
In your discussions with Richard Bissell
about the prospect of assassinating Lumumba, did he mention to
you that he had had similar discussions with Justin O'Donnell?
I was reminded of Justin O'Donnell's

role in all this. As you may recall, when I talked to you
and Mr. Wides, and until you reminded me I had forgotten
that Justin O'Donnell played any role whatsoever and now
that it has been brought to my recollection I recall it.
I recall it almost in detail.
I remember being told that he had expressed reservations
or disagreement or refusal to participate to Bissell and I
think my response to you was if he said that I would believe
him but I didn't recall it.
Mr. Baron. Did Richard Bissell ever indicate to you
that he had asked Justin O'Donnell to go to the Congo to
assassinate Lumumba?
Mr. Tweedy. Well, he must have indeed have told me
that he was going to ask O'Donnell to go to the Congo to
examine the thing on the ground, but I don't recall him ever

Mr. Baron. Would you assume that on a subject like this
such an instruction would have been given?
Mr. Tweedy. It would really be up to the Chief of
Station, I think. It would be up to the Chief of Station
what was in the cable and the degree to which he felt he
needed to maintain a record for quick reference purposes in
the future.
But, he was perfectly capable of keeping a file
which would be accessable only to him and the station and
if he was sure of his own security within the station I don't
think this would have been a problem for him, but to answer your
question I don't know what Hedgman himself did.
Mr. Baron. What kind of response did you receive from
Hedgman or from the Chief of Station in Leopoldville?

off Lumumba, not in those words.
Mr. Baron. When you say examine the thing on the ground
you mean he would send O'Donnell to the Congo to take a
first-hand look at the means?
Mr. Tweedy.
Yes, conceivably I suppose this all
might have resulted in a climax there but at least my recollec-
tion certainly was never that he told me that I am sending
O'Donnell to the Congo to knock off Lumumba in those words
but that he, I am sure the philosophy was that if anything
was done you would want to keep it as separate from the
station as possible and thus a man from the outside.
It was Bissell's idea that O'Connell might be the man.
Mr. Baron.

The man from outside?
Outside the station.

carry out an assassination operation if one were to be mounted?
Mr. Tweedy.
That if one was mounted it would
obviously be desirable to do it under auspices which would
protect the security of the station or involvement of the
station.
That I am sure was the philosophy behind it.

Mr. Tweedy. All he had to do was send a cable, He
could establish his own channel to Leopoldville with his own

He has the right to do that.
Mr. Baron. It would not be improper for a DDP to send
a cable or messenger to the Chief of Station in another
country?
Mr. Tweedy. I wouldn't comment on the appropriateness.
He obviously had the authority. My relationships with

Did you learn at any point that lethal bio-

of Station in Congo?
Mr. Tweedy.
This was mentioned when I talked to you and
Mr. Wides and my answer was that I don't recall it, but that
it was perfectly possible for them to be sent there.
Mr. Baron.
Mr. Tweedy.
How would they have been sent?
They could have been sent one or two ways,
they would have been sent through the pouch with the whole
thing wrapped in and addressed in such manner that it would be
opened only by the Chief of Station or somebody coming out
by hand of officer or hand of somebody either way it could be
done.
Mr. Baron. Do you have any knowledge of a messenger
from CIA headquarters having to go to the Congo to provide
the Chief of Station in the Congo with instructions to carry
out the assassination of Lumumba, if possible, and also pro-
vide him with the tools to carry out such an assassination,
namely, poisons and medical equipment for administering them?

him instructions that he was to carry out.
Congo?
Did you ever know of such a cable being sent to the
Mr. Tweedy. I should be very surprised if I didn't,
but I certainly have no recollection of it-whatsoever.
Mr. Baron. And the Chief of Station further testified
that shortly after receiving such a cable he received a visit
from Signey Cottlieb who arrived in
Leopoldville and
made himself known to the Chief of Station, the Chief of
chrides,
Station said that he immediately recognized Cottliebjas an
officer of the Agency, and as the messenger that this
cable referred to.
Subsequently, the Chief of Station said he had meetings
with Dr. Gottlieb in his apartment in Leopoldville where Dr.
Gottlieb gave him instructions that he said came from the
headquarters to carry out the assassination of Lumumba and
Dr. Gottlich also, according to the Chief of Station, gave
him lethal biological substances and medical equipment with
which to administer them.

to proceed without reference to anybody else he would pre-
sumably go ahead and do so.
Mr. Baron. But, because the feasibility of this
assassination of Lumumba had been discussed, this was not such
a tightly held subject that the DDP would have been circum-
vented?
Mr. Tweedy. DDP as far as I was concerned was the
person with whom the division first discussed the matter on-
tirely. I don't recall ever having discussed it with Allen
Dulles. I am sure when I say I am sure I assume Bissell dis-
cussed it with Allen Dulles but, this was never a matter
which was between the DCI's office and the Leopoldville
station insofar as I was aware, and to this day I don't
believe it ever was.
Mr. Baron. Just to clarify something we talked about
earlier when I think we were jumbling two questions together,
it is your expert opinion, expert in the sense of your knowl-
edge of the Agency, and your opinion as a participant at that
time that the testimony, the basic testimony we have received
about poisons being delivered to the Congo by Dr. Gottlieb with
instructions to use them in the assassination of Lumumba.
if possible, would be true testimony?
Mr. Tweedy.
Only way I can answer that question, Mr.
Baron, is to say I see not the slightest reason and do not
believe that you would have been lied to on this point.

jurisdiction over them in those days whatsoever.
Mr. Baron. That was his testimony, but it was incidental,
but if, as he has testified, that he met with Mr. Bissell and
yourself, you wouldn't dispute that testimony?
Mr. Tweedy. Absolutely not.
Mr. Baron. And that would be due to the intensity of
activity in the Congo at this point and the intensity of
concern over that activity?
Mr. Tweedy. Absolutely.
It was obviously becoming more
and more of a commitment of both the U.S. Government and
thus the agency.

Mr. Tweedy. That was my first visit to the Congo as I
recall, it was two weeks before independence.
I made a
long trip through Sub-Saharan Africa which culminated in
a drive from Kampala to Sambura and I flow from Sambura, I
guess, to Albertville and from Albertville to Leopoldville
and that is thefirst time I ever saw Leopoldville.

Mr. Tweedy. Yes, I was only there for, I suppose I
was there for four or five days and I thought I was going to
end my whole tour there and whole trip there but eventually
I had to go up to the Ivory Coast to settle an unexpected
problem.
Mr. Baron.
For the record would you agree with me
that independence was declared about June 30, 19607

of the exercise was that he wanted to meet a large number of
our new Chiefs of Stations in Africa and rather than make a trip
around Africa, which he hardly had time, he used a device
which we often used, which is to hold regional meetings at
a central point to which these people could have ready access

Rome, and the same way it was easy for East African Station
8
Chiefs to proceed to Nairobi, and he had the meetings there,
each one two or three days, I suppose.
Mr. Baron. Did the Chief of Station in the Congo
attend the meeting in Rome?
Mr. Tweedy. I am sure he would not. In other words,
if he saw Bissell he would have merely come to Rome and have
seen him, but he would have had no reason whatsoever, in
fact it would have been ridiculous for Bissell to invite a
man who didn't belong in the North African meetings and merely
raised the question whether Hedgman was there.
Mr. Baron. What region in the CIA organization chart
would the Chief of Station in the Congo belong to?
Mr. Tweedy.
We change around there. We had in

Mr. Baron. Having refreshed your recollection about
this meeting between the Chief of Station and Mr. Bissell and
yourself in Rome, do you recall what was discussed when you
were together?
Mr. Tweedy. I can only assume that some of the things
that we discussed by cable traffic were discussed.
The other thing I am sure must have been discussed was
what I would call the general assessment of the Congolese
situation and what the station might be required to do, thus
the sort of support headquarters was going to have to give
the Station.
Mr. Baron. Was there any discussion of the assassination
of Lumumba or the prospect of
Mr. Tweedy. I would be immensely surprised if it
wasn't discussed but I don't recall in what context it was

assume it was, at that point.

Mr. Tweedy. That is the way all cables were addressed.
I see he sent one specifically to DCI.
Mr. Baron. Off the record.
(Discussion off the record.)
Mr. Baron. Onthe record.
Let's turn back now.
I believe while we were off the record and axamining this
cable closely you corrected me, Mr. Tweedy, on the fact that
this cable was not sent from Leopoldville to the Director but
to Leopoldville; is
rather it was sent from headquarters
that correct?
Mr. Tweedy.
Correct.
14
Mr. Baron. And it appears to you from the designation
"Allen W. Dulles", at the top of the telegram, that this was
a personal message signed off by the DCI himself to the Chief
of Station.
Mr. Tweedy. Correct. As I said, he might not have
drafted it but it certainly would have been his sign off.
Mr. Baron.
And let me direct your attention to
:
the portion of the cable that says in high quarters here it is
the clear-cut conclusion that if LLL continues to hold high
:
office the inevitable result will at best be chaos and at
worst pave the way to a Communist takeover of the Congo with
disastrous consequences for the prestige of the U.N. and for
the interests of the Free World generally.

This contains references to the fact that
"the station ws flooded with reports re outcome Mobutu coup".
And the cable goes on to discuss the fact that U.N.
troops had interferred with Congolese troops and prevented
them from arresting Lumumba.
Now, this cable was sent to the CIA headquarters
from Leopoldville one day after Lumumba sought protective
custody from the United Nations and two days after the Mobutu
coup where Mobutu took over the government.
In the cable as it has been sanitized by the Agency
it now reads:
"Station advised two moderate Congolese politician
try work with key Congolese contact in effort eliminate
Lumumba.
Fear U.N. protection will give Lumumba opportunity
to organize counterattack. Only solution is remove him
from scene soonest".
WAS that the attitude of the Agency at this point,
as far as you understood it, that the fact that Lumumba
was in U.N. protective custody did not eliminate him as a
threat in the Congo?
Mr. Tweedy. I don't really recall but I think the
chances are that we feared that U.N. protective custody
might very well result in his early release or his ability stil
to control matters. I should think that is very probable.
Mr. Baron. And that is the reason why there would be

Although the top of this cable does not indicate where
the cable was sent to and from, because we don't have the
cover sheet for the cable, you have indicated to me by looking
at the designations that this cable must have been sent from
Leopoldville to headquarters, is that correct, Mr. Tweedy?
Mr. Tweedy. That is correct.
Mr. Baron. Let me direct your attention to paragraph
7 which says:
"Station checking recurring reports of Kasavubu Lumumba
reconcilation. Kasavubu denies Bolikango failed deny
possibility of Lumumba entering new government, possibly
as vice Premier. Believe some substance to rumor but will
do best prevent if Lumumba allowed even minor role he most apt
come out on top".
Does that indicate to you that the Chief of Station
in the Congo at this point continued to be extremely concerned
that Lumumba should not be allowed even a minor role in the
government of the Congo?
Mr. Tweedy. That is what it says.
Mr. Baron. Next, as Exhibit 4, we have a cable dated

who caused his death?
52
Mr. Tweedy. I must say I have a hard time following the
question. This means that Lumumba arrived under the Congo-
lese auspices in Kutanga and that Elizabethville, the base at
Elizabethville didn't know he was coming, our base, didn't
know very much, didn't presumably know very much about what
occurred, and reported very briefly on what they had heard.
Baron. Let me put the question in context.
Mr.
On January 17, Lumumba had been flown to Kutanga?
Mr. Tweedy. Yes.
Mr. Baron. And later United Nations investigations con
cluded that it was the 17th or perhaps the 18th that Lumumba
was actually killed in Kutanga.
I was asking you before whether this cable would indi-
cate that the United States would have been involved in
bringing about the death of Lumumba?
Mr. Tweedy. I would have thought that it merely in-
dicates that this part of the Agency, i.e., Elizabethville
had no idea he was coming, knew nothing about his fate
except these few phrases that he put down here and would imp:
although it certainly doesn't say so, that he was adding a
little information to what was perhaps an enormously ignorant
Leopoldville which, of course, is the fact of the matter.
We didn't know how all this was occurring and were not able
to follow the event except after the event.

That was not the purpose for his being sent. The purpose for

what I would suspect was the way it occurred.

Mr. Baron. I am at the end of my questions on specific
facts concerning the Congo during this period of time leading
up to Lumumba's death which, as you know, is the narrow
subject of our inquiry right now, and first of all I want
to say that I appreciate tremendously and know that the
Committee is appreciative and grateful for your testimony
here today. It is a difficult subject. It is only one
narrow aspect of what the Committee is undertaking, and un-
pleasant, but unnecessary aspect to assemble.
I wonder if you have any facts that you would like to att
to the record that you think are necessary to put our dis-
cussion today into context?
Mr. Tweedy. I think the strongest recollection about

which would be a member of the Congo Club, and it was rather
typical of the way the government worked on this thing and I
personally felt excellent advised that the U.S. was absolutely
right to support the U.N. on this. I think it could have been
a total disaster if Kutanga had been allowed to succeed,
and although Mobutu was acting like an ass now, that is
Africa for you, but on the whole that country has done pretty
well and I consider we had a considerable role in giving it
a chance to move the way it has.
There are going to be ups and downs with the things
but that is the way it is. I feel very strongly about it.
Does that somewhat answer your question,
does that help?
Mr. Baron. I simply wanted to give you a chance.
Mr. Tweedy. I felt that very strongly and no other assign-
ment that I have ever had was this kind of government team
and cooperation ever really required.because we weren't
engaged or I wasn't engaged in that kind of activity.
Mr. Baron. is this government team efforts that you are
talking about one that was primarily put together to carry
out the paramilitary activities in the Congo in the
latter part of the 60's, '62, 163.
Mr. Tweedy. It was put together to preside over what -
ever activity the United States Government felt it needed

purely policy questions of what the Ambassador to the U.N.
might say to the Secretary General of the U.N.or what the
President might want to say conceivably I suppose to the

certainly didn't just involve what CIA was going to be
involved in. It was the whole policy ball of wax with res-
pect to the Congo which obviously had many ganglia and which
the CIA part and paramilitary activity was just a bit.
Mr. Baron. Did this high degree of organization and
intensity of concern begin sometime after the death of Lumumba
or had it gotten rolling?
Mr. Tweedy. I think
Mr. Baron. After the Congolese independence?
Mr. Tweedy. I think the U.S. Government was thoroughly
seized with the intimate problem and danger of a disintegrating
Congo that started in the earliest days of independence
and continued and, of course, when the Tschombe-Kutanga
thing became a fact of life, which is basically why the U.N.
was there, then, of course, that was it.
In other words, I would say that U.S. involvement, U.S.
concern, merely moved with the events, as anybody could read
them in the press just continued and continued, but one thin:
was perfectly clear, was that the .5. was quite determined
through. Nothing had been clearer than
to see this thing through.

As you know, there is a lot of mystery surrounding his

Joe Satterswate, who was Assistant Secretary for

talking together about CIA deployment in Africa. I was
forming a division both at home and abroad and I had a lot

of things to negotiate with him jabout Rtate cover for

we wanted to do, and we spent a great deal of time arguing
these things out, making arrangements and so on and so forth.
To be frank with you, I have far less recollection al
intimate policy talks on places like the Congo with that

Mr. Baron. It was during the Kennedy Administration
that the large scale paramilitary operations in the Congo were
geared up.
Mr. Tweedy. All that happened then, absolutely.
Mr. Baron. Do you remember discussions with Livingstone
Merchant in the State Department before the turn of Adminis-
trations?
Mr. Tweedy. I knew Livingstone Merchant but specific
discussions with him I really do not recall, no.
Later on
I remember having a couple of meetings along with Mr. Rusk.
Mr. Baron, Did any of those neetings concern Lumumba ?
Mr. Tweedy. No, Mr. Rusk, I think they exclusively
concerned Portuguese Africa.
Mr. Baron. Do you remember having any meetings alone

the way President Kennedy presided over those two meetings.
He was annoyed by the Congo and irritated by it and he was
worried that he had to spend so much bloody time on it, but
he was damn well determined to see the thing through and he
was continually goosing his staff to do just that but
in support of the U.N. We weren't going to do it all by
ourselves. It couldn't have been clearer.
Mr. Baron. All right, as I mentioned before, the
Committee is interested in your wisdom on policy-making and
analysis in the intelligence community generally and there may
be other members of the Committee staff that would like to call
upon you to testify on other subjects because of your long
experience in Agency activities.
But I want to thank you now for your complete coopera-
tion and the tremendous amount of information that you have
provided on this one subject that has been very helpful?
Mr. Tweedy. Thank you, Mr. Baron. I can assure you any-
thing I can do to help the Committee in other areas I
will be glad to do it and if I don't think I can help be-
cause I don't think I know enough about the subject I will just
say so, otherwise I am not afraid to put my two bits in.
