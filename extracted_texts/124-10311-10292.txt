Files of Legat, Bern, have been reviewed for
individuals residing in Switzerland and Austria considered
to be a possible threat to the President, and no one was
found to fit this category.
In addition, discreet inquiry was made of the
following sources, all of whom had no knowledge of individuals
who might be considered threats:
NMOHS 302Hs) (25)
SIMIR
Consular Section, the Embassy, Bern;
[ Office of Special Assistant ((covert (CIA),;)] (③)
Embassy, Bern;
American Consulate General, Vienna;
(A) the Embassy,
Research Branch ((covert CIA:): (SC)
Vienna;
Security Officer, the Embassy, Vienna.
In this regard, however, Bureau attention is called
to the case entitled PAUL GEORGE ANDERSON, aka, IS-X (Bufe
100-415051). ANDERSON has been reported to be of interest
to the Secret Service (Legat, Paris, letter dated 10/16/64).
While he does not reside in territory covered by this office,
he is in rather frequent transit en route to Hungary where
he is attempting to obtain a visa for his Hungarian wife to
enter the U.S.
