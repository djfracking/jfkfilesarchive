available to analyze and collate periodically the LIENVOY and other Station
product in the individual Soviet files for transmittal to Headquarters for
its information; or possibly more important, for eventual transmittal to another
Station where a Soviet from Mexico City is reassigned. Headquarters attention
is directed again to MEXI-9885 of 17 January 1962 and allied correspondence
regarding the desirability of having a trained Headquarters TDYer work on these
materials at the Station. Headquarters may now wish to reinvestigate the
possibility of finding a qualified staffer for this TDY assignment.

PERSONALITY BRIEF
B-A
3.
•
General Lazaro CARDENAS del Rio
As a pro-Communist, anti-United States former (1934-1940)
President of Mexico, CARDENAS plays an important role in the
political activities of Mexico by virtue of his being the
spirtual leader of a great part of the Mexican left. His
leftist sympathies appear to fall primarily with the current
regime in Cuba (He alledgedly is a close personal friend of
Fidel CASTRO), secondarily with Communist China, and
lastly with the USSR.
2. Braulio MALDONADO Sandez
MALDONADO is a politically unscrupulous pro-Communist
former Governor of Baja California. He is a national leader
of at least three Mexican leftist organizations: (1) FEP
(People's Electoral Front), united single front of Mexican
Communists and Leftists; (2) MLN (National Liberation
Movement), rabidly anti-U.S., pro-Cuba Communist Front; and
(3) CCI (Independent Peasants' Center), radical, anti-Mexican
Government organization. Having been banished from Mexico
until after the 1964 elections for anti-government activities,
MALDONADO is currently in Europe and seeking admittance to
the USSR, obstensibly to visit his daughter who is a student
at the Friendship University in Moscow.
3.
Alonso AGUILAR Monteverde
;
AGUILAR is a prominent pro-Communist Mexican intellectual
who is the titular head of the MLN (National Liberation
Movement), rabidly anti-U.S., pro-Communist front. He is a
full-time professor at the National Autonomous University of
Mexico and maintains active contact with several international
leftist and Communist figures. He has recently travelled to
Cuba and Warsaw.
4.
Jorge Leonidas TAMAYO Castillejos
TAMAYO is a Communist professor at the National Autonomous
University of Mexico. He is a leading member of many Communist
front activities in Mexico including the CMP (Mexican Peace

The Cuban efforts at propaganda in Mexico in which the Cuban
Ambassador to Mexico conferred with Raul Roa, Cuban Foreign
Minister, and suggested to him that Fidel Castro write a short
message to the Mexican people in Siempre on its ninth anniver-
sary of publication (see HMMA 19399).
The negative treatment to a Czech commercial representative
by Mexican Immigration authorities (see HMMA 19158).
The refusal by the Pan American Institute of Geography and
History of the Organization of American States to permit Teresa
Proenza Proenza, Third Secretary and Cultural Attache at the
Cuban Embassy, to attend the meeting held by it (see HMM 6438).
The embarrassment caused by the immoral behavior of Mexican
female delegates to the Cuban 26 July celebration held in Havana
in 1961 according to Manuel Marcue Parinas of the periodical
Politica as told to Teresa Proenza Proenza.
D. Liaison
With the approach of the GPIDEAL visit to Mexico 29 June - 1 July,
Haison activities greatly increased. COS visited LITENSOR on 28 June.
LITENSOR assured that there would be no problems in the GPIDEAL visit
and the safety of GPIDEAL was guaranteed and in the hands of LITENSOR.
At this meeting LITENSOR indicated his annoyance with the Cubans. (See
MEXI 1253).
LIELEGANT turned over to the Chief of Station a list of persons who
were put under surveillance in connection with the GPIDEAL visit. The list
also indicated those who were arrested, (See MEXIS 1244 and 1264).
At a meeting held on 28 May 1962, the Chief of Station, LIELEGANT,
and LIENVOY/2 met with LIENVOY/1 and obtained his agreement to hire
LIENVOY/14 to work under LIENVOY/3 as a technical inspector in Telefonos
de Mexico. The purpose in putting LIENVOY/14 in this capacity is to have a
man who would be more available to the LIENVOY Project and who "would see
what others might be tapping telephones" in Telefonos de Mexico. Further-
more, LIENVOY/1 agreed to see to it that LIENVOY/14 would have "the
range and authority" to do the work.
Putting LIENVOY/14 as a technical inspector within Telefonos, could
create problems for the LIFEAT Project. At the same time WILSTED is re-
studying the LIFEAT system, improving it, tightening up the security and
alerting the base houses to watch for any abnormal activity on present taps.
It has been understood by the LIENVOY case officer that this has been done
and it will be reported from time to time in future LIENVOY reports.
E. Security
For a report on security of the LIENVOY site for June 1962, see
paragraph 2 E of HMMA-19319 (RYBAT-1897) dated 10 July 1962.
As was stated at the end of that paragraph, any surveillance or
security threat of the LIENVOY basehouse or personnel can eventually be
handled, should this be found necessary, by Chief of Station to LITENSOR.

Francis R. HEGARTY, the regular case office: handling LINLUCK
made the following comments pertinent to FORTYUNE' report of
possible surveillance:
"Ox 22 November, HEGARTY sited safehouse at Rio Hudson to
remove the typewriter and paper and inform the maid in charge that he
intended to leave the apartment on the following day and also to arrange
for the payment of the ligh: bill which was due. After arranging these
matters, HEGARTY laft the safehouse and purposely took a circuitous
ruuts to his car, which had been parked more than a block away on
another street. HEGARTY turned two corners and crossed two streets
and detected an individual, Mexican in appearance, approximately six
feet tall, 170 lbs., brown hair, ruddy complexion, wearing a tan sult
and open sport shirt, and carrying a manila folder in his left hand,
wa'king about 30 feet behind him. HEGARTY walked past his car and
farned a third corner and walked rapidly to the middle of the block and
then turned in his tracks. When HEGARTY reached the last corner
he had turned be almost ran into the individual described above. The
unan opened his eyes wide, hesitated in mid-stride, but then kept on
walking in the direction he had been going. HEGARTY walked to his
car and after making sure that the individual did not turn back, immediately
left the area." HEGARTY is certain that the salehouse at Rio Hudson
was not under surveillance up until 10 November, the last time he
visited it previously, and that the surveillance is an the house and not
as himself.
In a later chock of
this area by HEGARTY, he could detect no #veillance either stationary
or
er moving. SHOQUIST, however. Instructed him to get a new safehouse
far LINLUCK meetings immediately following his 22 November report
and for neither he nor LINLUCK to go near the Rio Hudson safehouse agaia.
Station Comment: See 2 a (Conclusione) above.

"On 1 June 1962, while leaving a meeting with LITAN-1;

in the Cafe Blanca on Juares Avenue, between Lafragua Street and the

in the face of a wall, young, dark-haired man apparently waiting in
the doorway for something. I had left the meeting first. leaving LITAUI

on up to Reforma where I turned into the Reforme entrance to Sanborn's,
checked for surveillance, then into the hambassy by the entrance from Sanborn's
through the perfume section. There is to dubt whatsoever that these men
were on me. The surveillance was not sophisticated from the standpoint of
keeping me unaware, but was a very persistent one with these inen not gett lag

have cancelled all operational contacts for today and will contact HEGARTY,

Oliver Q. WIMPHEN and Simon D, CLACKETT tonight
morning to set up eurirely new contad arrangements with each. I plan to
make my contacts either early in the m rings or later at night in areas where
surveillance can be spotted easily. I will instruct all agents to be unusually
with other agents or
careful in checking before making any meetings, either
with me and that if there is any suspicion of survelliance skip the contact and
check later at the alternate contact point in each case, if clear by the time of
the alternate meeting, I called HEGARTY from a pay phone last night and set
up an early morning contact with him to check on whether or act he was fol-
iowed when he left the Hotel Alameda vesterday, HEGARTY sald that he
checked carefully but that there was no indication of interest in him. This is
quite a relief since it now appears that I must have been picked up at the Rm-
bassy and that I, not HEGARTY, was the target, I cautioned HSGARTY w bo
even more careful than ever in his approaches to the LINLUCK safehouse and
sold him that, in our contacts, I was setting up entirely new contact arrange-
ments Immediately and that we would not use previous points uptown again.
HEGARTY was told that we would use previously agreed upon points in the
Palanco-Lomas area, that each point and time for the next meeting would bo
agreed upon at the previous one to avold phone use as much as possible, and
that most of our meetings wa id be held betore 0900 hours or, when that not
feasible, after dark. I suggested that he also inform LINLUCK that I had
been under survelliance of some persistence and that he (LINLUCK) should
be even more careful than ever in his contacts with HEGARTY, and in his
approaches to the safehouse. I met WIMPHEN and CLACKETT later that same
morning and made simular new contact arrangements with them and advised
them of the even greater need for caution, I also advised them to park at
least two to three blocks from potuts of contact and walk in, checking care-
fully before and after parking to be sure they are act survellied and, if there
is any suspicion of surveillance, do not make contact but make the alternato
lazer if clear by them,'

B. Algernon O. FORTYUNE.
The above-mentioned noted o
hof in November 1961 at
approximately 2100 hours what seemed to be a suspicious situation
in attempting to service the LINK safe, A indicated on the
attached diagrain, the subject parken his automobile two biorks away
as indicated on the diagram and approached the target by way of Panuco
Street. In the approach runthe subject anted a blue Fint parked at the
corner of Lerma and Hudson Streets with two male occupants. As the
undersigned, on foot, approached the corner of Panuco and Hudson ha
noticed another Flat parked at the very corner with three occupants.
Remembering the other Fist at the end of the block, which was quite
visible from the corner of Panuco ard Hudson, the undersigned decided
to delay entry into the safehouse and casually walk down the block.
The undersigued cut across Hudson Street to avoid walking close to the
parked car and as he walked on Lerma, noticed the presence of a alow
moving car behind him. This did not arouse too much muspicion since
this area apparently specializes in street walkers and the local "tenorios”
cruise the streets looking for them, As the undersigned reached the
parked Q.P. car at the corner of Lerma and Duaro the slow moving auto
came abread of the car and the driver almost stopped and stared at the
undersigned as he attempted to unlock the car to depart the area. By
this time the undersigned got auspicious and attempted to read the license
plate, but the plate illumination bull, was out on the suspicious vehicle.
The undersigued got in his own car, started down Lerma, passed the
suspicious car which immediately fell in behind the undersigned, Not
convinced yet of the intent of the following car, the undersigned drove
toward Mississippi and made like he was continuing down on Larma. As
the last moment the undersigned swerved into Mississippi, marrowly
missing getting clobbered by a vehicle coming down Mississippi. The
suspicious vehicle, who was right behind, had to gun his auto to get out
of the way no that ho had to go straight across Lerma. The undersigned
noted as he made the sudden turn into Mississippi that the other rahicle
braked as soon as he passed Mississippi and, it seemed to the under-
aigned, was backing up toward Mississippi. At this point the undersigned
poured the coal into the old Green Hornet and left the area. The ondero
signed then want to the Polanco Rowling Alley instead of home, howled
for approximately an hour and then returned at 2300 hears to inspect
the area of action once more. The area was compistely free of any
parked autos. The undersigned cruised around the area for approximately
35 minutes but could not spot either one of the two Fiats.
Conclusions: (a) As previously stated, there may have been nothing
to this incident, and perhaps the autos in question were merely the joy
cars looking for customers, but at any rate the set-up looked suspicious
therefore the undersigned did not service the safehouse in question.
(b) Desiglas NISLEY reported to the undersigned that his
records that a suspected Polish untelligence agent. Josef DEJ, resided
at Hudson li, two doors down lemn the LINLUCK valehsues. It is
possible that the surveillance may have been on DEJ and that the under-
signed blundered into an unpleasant situation.
(c) UNLUCK reported on 14 November 1961 that it was
possible that be was under surveillance and a possible that he was
followed to the safehouse.

Direccion Federal de Seguridad - Federal Security Police
The principal functions of this security unit are to:
(1) Provide a plain-clothed security detail for the President,
(2) maintain an extensive telephone tap activity on both
the Rightist and Leftist political opposition forces, and
(3) perform investigations and arrests of primarily political
offenses. The unit's agents are largely poorly trained,
insecure, and unreliable. Their professional characteristics
are best described as being dishonest, cruel, and abusive.
The position, at this moment, of Manuel RANGEL Escamilla as
Director General of DFS is precarious.
10. Politica
A Marxist anti-U.S. semi-monthly magazine published in
Mexico, Politica is printed by Talleres Graficos de Mexico,
the same shop which prints La Voz de Mexico. In addition to
the modest revenues derived from a circulation of 15,000
to 25,000, Politica is financed by the Soviet Embassy, the
MLN, the PPS, and possibly, the Cuban Embassy. As an
indication of the Mexican government's assessment of the
capability of this magazine to influence public opinion, it
is worthwhile noting that Politica frequently experiences a
great degree of difficulty in printing and circulating itself
due to the government's repressive efforts.
11. Movimiento de Liberacion Nacional (MLN)
Organized under the influence of the PCM in August 1961,
the MLN today is dedicated to the furtherance of the mutual
interests of its adherents who are found primarily in the
ranks of the PRI, the PPS, the PCM, the CNC and the UGOCM.
The MLN's objective is to gain leftist political represen-
tation in the government by inciting PRI to accept leftists
into its camp. As a consequence of this objective, the mission
of MLN is to generate evidence of popular leftist sympathy
by means of fomenting agitation among the popular, labor, and
peasant masses.
12. Confederacion de Trabajadores de la America Latina (CTAL)
The CTAL has recently been replaced by the CUTAL (Single

was ill. (See MEXI 0822, 17 May 1962).
D. Liaison
During the period under review the Chief of Station maintained
regular contact with LIELEGANT and other individuals connected with the
Project.
E. Security
There were no evident security problems for the month of May.
F. Technical
As usual, the equipment in the LP was checked and cleaned. However,
during the month several of the lines were out of order. The Cuban Embassy
was apparently still working on its telephonic system within the building. Other
lines which were out of order were probably due to the inherent problems of
the telephone company.
C. Personnel
There was no change in the personnel for the month and it kept the
same schedule of work as reported for April.
H. Production
During May, LIENVOY produced the forty-five (45) positive intel-
ligence reports indicated in the attachment and the usual volume of CI/CE
personality and operational material,

1.
An error was made by the person preparing HMM-A-18,752
(RYBAT-1833) or by the typist who chose the DFS list of taps
(in HMM-A-18,246) instead of the correct LIENVOY list of targets.
2. The only explanation available is that with a change of
Case Officers (Malcolm Q. EDELAND departed to become COS, Tegucigalpa),
and with the delay in writing monthly reports on LIENVOY and lack of
familiarity with the operation, the error was made--either by the
drafting officer or by the typist.
3. This error will not occur again.

bureau of the WFTU (World Federation of Trade Unions) whose
headquarters are in Prague, was headed by Vicente LOMBARDO
Toledano.
13. Prensa Latina
Operationg directly under the Cuban Communist regime,
Prensa Latina is obstensibly a press service. In reality,
however, it is the official propaganda organ of the Cuban
Government. Prensa Latina works closely with Tass, the
Soviet Agency; with Hsinhua, the Chinese Agency; and with
Cetepka, the Czechoslovakian Agency.

ABSTRACT
MICROFILM
1. Referenced dispatch listed the target lines for LIKEVOY for
December 1961 and January 1962. Your attention is drawm to the fact that
the targets listed coincide exactly with the list of 18 tape furnished in
HEMA-18246 dated 1 December 1961.
2. The February 1962 LIKĦVOY target listing also furnished in refer-
anced dispatch appears to be correctly labeled LIKEVOY.
3. Your comments on paragraph one above are requested.

1. The Nexico City Station has the capability of approaching
LITSGOR (Iden A) and requesting his to attempt to arrange for a
safe conduct pass for Subject. The approach to LITESSOR can be
wade through three different channels; LITS220/2, (Iden B), LIFEGANT
(Iden C), and LIGO (Idon D). Also, a direct approach by the COS
to LITESOR could probably be arranged if so desiral by Headquarters
for operational security reasons.
No assessment on the success of an approach of this type
can be made because of the Mexican interest and position re Cuba,
2.
3. If a decision is pade to attempt to obtain a safe conduct
pass for Subject, it is recommended that the COS Maxico City be
informed in detail of Headquarters minious and aerious goals and
that he be requested to recommend the best channel to LITE 303,

information on his activities, and especially on his travels and his
contact with Samuel VEGA Perez, Chief of 6-2 at the Cuban Embassy

MENORANDUM FOR: Chief, Foreign Intelligence
:
SUBJECT:
TDY to Mexico City
1. After taking a good look at LIENVOY and LIFEAT, I would agree
with the persons I talked with in Mexico; they maintain that any well-
run tap operation should produce substantial intelligence information,
provided the targets are of intelligence interest, and provided also
there are people at the station who look for it and are able to recog-
nize it. The case of LIFEAT is interesting in this respecti It has
been deprived of its most productive lines in favor of LIENVOY, and
yet its intelligence production compares favorably, with that of the
other productive tape, except LIENVOY.
2. Mexico has people who can detect any little item of intelli-
gence significance. This includes the Chief of Station, who goes over
the highlights of the previous day's take every morning and marks
certain items for action by station case officers or reports officers.
The reports officers work on copies of the take at the same time.
3. There are several aspects of LIENVOY that make it an excellent
operation and an outstanding producer of intelligence. I will describe
them in detail when my notes get here from the station. The principal
factors in the success of LIRNVOY seem to be the following.
8.
The agreement made with top Maxican officials, unlike
many such agreements elsewhere, is as much in effect today as it
was at the start: the targeting is not based on personal politics;
the intercept staff has stayed on the job; the equipment is con-
sidered to be on loan from CIA.
b. The native monitoring staff has reached a peak of effec-
tiveness that everyone at the station praises very highly.
C. The station is organized to handle the take speedily as
soon as it comes in. The Chief of Station, the case officers, the
reports officers, all work on it at the same time and exchange

The following message has been received from Mexico Citys
For King and Sayre from Ambassador Manns
•
1. As you know, some weeks ago we became convinced that only chance
getting Mexico to break relations with Cuba would do on basis Cuban
intervention Mexican internal affairs. This of course was on asscription
two thirds Rio treaty vote could not be obtained at Punta Del Esto.
2. With this objective in mind Dept and CAS authorized me to turn
over materials described in IN 12549 to appropriate Mexican official.
I chose Gustave DIAZ Ordas.
3. DIAZ Ordas has informed CAS that he discussed this evidence with
Lopas Matons who expressed surprise and interest. We discount Lopez Mateos
statements because as you know he has much better evidence of Cuban Embassy
intervention which he keeps strictly to himself and has never told Cabinet
about. The evidence we turned over to DIAM Ordas has psychological importance
because President is now aware that DIAZ Ordaz also known part of the story.
Ha can hovor be sure that DTAL Onls will not use this to support his own
´anti-communist convictions if a showdown between the Commies and anti-Commies
should occur in Mexico.
4. DIAZ Ordas has asked no through CAS whether I would have any objection
if the information we furnished him were made public should an appropriate
occasion arise in the future. He said there would be no mention of the U.S.
Govt and that Gobernacion would present the ovidence as collected by it.
5. I recommend that CAS and fept authorise me to inform DIAZ Ordaz that
we have no objection on the basis outlined by him. Reason for my recommend-
ation is that on the one hand we lose little by blowing the microphone operation
since battery is coheduled to expire soon in any case. We believe we are in a
position where we can safely dany that we had anything to do with placing micro-
phone. In this connection DIAL Ordas obviously believes our story that wo
picked up signal by routine dialing of different frequencica and that, microphone
vas presumably placed by Soviets to check on their satellites. On other hand
affirmative answer to DIAZ Ordas will also implicitly suggest the possibility
that the time may come when we ourselves might wish to make this information

public. I can think of no better incentive to Lopes Mateos to break relations
with Cuba than possibility Mexican public might eventually become aware of
extent to which Mexico has tolerated Cuban intervention in spite of its vaunted
devotion to the doctrine of non-intervention.
6. Finally I wish to say that I realise all of these maneuvers involve
some risk to U.S. but I believe resurgence of Communist influence in last two
months requires unusual counteraction on our part.
7. DIAZ Ordan has returned material to CAS for safe keeping and it is
now in our possession. He claims he made no copies and we believe this probably
true.

FOR GALBOND AND SAYRE FROM AMBASSADOR MANN:
AS YOU KNOW, SOME WEEKS AGO WE BECAME CONVINCED THAT Only
CHANCE OF GETTING MEXICO TO BREAK RELATIONS WITH CUBA WOULD BE ON
BASIS CUBAN INTERVENTION MEXICAN INTERNAL AFFAIRS. THIS OF COURSE
WAS ON ASSUMPTION TWO THIRDS RIO TREATY VOTE COULD NOT BE OSTAINED
AT PUNTA DEL ESTE.
3. WITH THIS OBJECTIVE IN MIND DEPT AND CAS AUTHORIZED ME TO
2012549
TURN OVER MATERIALS DESCRIBED IN MEXI 9855 TO APPROPRIATE MEXICAN
OFFICIAL. I CHOSE GUSTAVO DIAZ ORDAZ.
"
:
WE DIS-
:
3. DIAZ ORDAZ HAS INFORMED CAS THAT HE DISCUSSED THIS EVIDENCE
WITH LOPEZ MATEOS WHO EXPRESSED SURPRISE AND INTEREST.
COUNT LOPEZ MATEOS STATEMENTS BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW HE HAS MUCH
BETTER EVIDENCE OF CUBAN EMBASSY INTERVENTION WHICH HE KEEPS
STRICTLY TO HIMSELF AND HAS NEVER TOLD CABINET ABOUT. THE
EVIDENCE WE TURNED OVER TO DIAZ ORDAZ HAS PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE
BECAUSE PRESIDENT IS NOW AWARE THAT DIAZ ORDAZ ALSO KNOWS PART
OF THE STORY. HE CAN NEVER BE SURE THAT DIAZ ORDAZ WILL NOT USE

RIS TO SUPPORT HIS OWN ANTI-COMMUNIST CONVICTIONS IF A SHOWDOWN
between thE COMMIES AND ANTI-COMMIES SHOULD OCCUR IN MEXICO.
.
4. DIAZ ORDAZ HAS ASKED ME THROUGH CAS WHETHER I WOULD HAVE ANY
OBJECTION IF THE INFORMATION WE FURNISHED HIM WERE MADE PUBLIC
SHOULD AN APPROPRIATE OCCASION ARISE IN THE FUTURE. HE SAID THERE
WOULD BE NO-MENTION OF THE U.S. GOVT AND THAT GOBERNACION WOULD
PRESENT THE EVIDENCE AS COLLECTED BY IT.
50
I RECOMMEND THAT CAS AND DEPT AUTHORIZE ME TO INFORM DIAZ
ORDAZ THAT WE HAVE NO OBJECTION ON THE BASIS OUTLINED BY HIM.
REASON FOR MY RECOMMENDATION IS THAT ON THE ONE HAND WE LOSE LITTLE
BY BLOWING THE MICROPHONE OPERATION SINCE BATTERY IS SCHEDULED
TO EXPIRE SOON IN ANY CASE. WE BELIEVE WE ARE IN A POSITION WHERE
WE CAN SAFELY DENY THAT WE HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH PLACING MICRO-
PHONE. IN THIS CONNECTION DIAZ ORDAZ OBVIOUSLY BELIEVES OUR STORY
THAT WE PICKED UP SIGNAL BY ROUTINE DIALING OF DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES
AND THAT MICROPHONE WAS PRESUMABLY PLACED BY SOVIETS TO CHECK
ON THEIR SATELLITES. ON OTHER HAND AFFIRMATIVE ANSWER TO DIAZ ORDAZ
WILL ALSO IMPLICITLY SUGGEST THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE TIME MAY COME
WHEN WE OURSELVES MIGHT WISH TO MAKE THIS INFORMATION PUBLIC.
I CAN THINK OF NO BETTER INCENTIVE TO LOPEZ MATEOS TO BREAK RELATIONS
WITH CUDA THAN POSSIBILITY MEXICAN PUBLIC MIGHT EVENTUALLY BECOME
AWARE OF EXTENT TO WHICH MEXICO HAS TOLERATED CUBAN INTERVENTION
IN SPITE OF ITS VAUNTED DEVOTION TO THE DOCTRINE OF NON-INTERVENTION.
6. FINALLY I WISH TO SAY THAT I REALIZE ALL OF THESE MANEUVERS
INVOLVE SOME RISK TO U.S. BUT I BELIEVE RESURGENCE OF COMMUNIST
INFLUENCE IN LAST TWO MONTHS REQUIRES UNUSUAL COUNTERACTION ON

COULD PROVIDE TAPES OF TRANSCRIPTS SHOULD THEY BE NEEDED. 'COS LATER
COVERED, HOWEVER, BY STATING TO LITEMPO-2 THAT HE THOUGHT SOME TAPES
HAD BEEN ERASED." THIS STALL WAS STRENGTHENED BY FIRM STATEMENT THAT
COLOMBIAN STUDENT TAPE WOULD BE AVAILABLE (IT HAS SINCE BEEN DELIVERED

on Cuban intervention in Mexican
internal affairs.

RECENTLY RETURNED TO STATION BY HQS. THIS TAPE WILL BE PASSED

DOR. SAMÉ SUB PARAGRAPH WAS FABRICATED BY STATION AND BASED ON STATION'

d. Each new item on a target person is linked to a past
history; what appears as a fragmentary bit in a conversation
becomes a meaningful development in a continuous story. Conti-
nuity on the job makes this possible.
8. The equipment is kept in good working order by complete
cleaning and checking of each unit once a month. The 32 units
in use today are those installed in 1959.
4
A detailed description of LIENVOY and its counterpart LIFEAT
should provide good models with which to compare other tap operations.
It should give criteria for good procedures. It should give some idea
of the desirable size of such operations, considering the available
targets, the size of the station, and the other tasks and operations of
the station. It should show what the station puts into its tap opera-
tions and what it gets out of then. LIENVOY and LIFEAT are an interesting
example of two interacting operations, one joint and the other indepond-
ent.
5. My stay in Mexico was as interesting and fruitful as it was
enjoyable. And I hope it was not too great a burden on the station.

• Operations Proposed by Station Mexico City to
Influence Mexico to Preek Relations with Cuba.

Ambassador and insert it into the joint telephone tapping
operation wo operate for the President.
To attempt to persuade a longtime Mexican exployee of th
Cuban Embassy to defect and make a public statement con-
dawning Cubans for interference in Mexican affairs,
D. Should it not be possible to have the Subject abovo maks
a public defection, attempt through him to obtain incrizimting
documents or propaganda from the Cuban Embassy that are suito

youth within the Embassy builting.

Dear Willard:
This may seem to you like a voice out of the void, but I
always carry in my mind your repeated invitations to visit you
and remember clearly your acquaintance and kindness to my
brother. Strangely enough it seems to continue to be true
that the only escape from this jail-like desk is back to my
old area where I never expected to return--I even had one this
Spring. Just now I have a specific reason for wanting to
visit your place, that is, in addition to our own personal
reasons.
For some time I have been bent on trying to push for more
positive information from taps and audio, I realize that it
iɛ taken for granted around the world that the purpose of taps
and audio is for operational leads, particularly in the KUDESI
field.
In one or two places in the world, positive production is
outstanding and we have been making a study for some time
trying to see why it works in some cases and not in others.
One of the outstanding examples is LIFEAT and especially LIENVOY.
These seem to be far ahead of other similar operations around
the world even though they seem to approach the problem
somewhat similarly. It occurred to me that wo might find out
what makes yours so especially effective by having one of my
people go to your station for a few days to talk with you and
your officers and get the detailed story. I could then take
another look at the other operations and see what's missing ar
what's wrong, I'm sure this would be of great help to the
place as a whole. If you agree, I will send Paul V. Levister
(Iden), the editor of our Foreign Intelligence Series (our
Staff doctrinal papers, the first few of which have been
dispatched to you). He could be in Mexico City on or about
23 September, or any time thereafter that is more convenient
for you and your people. Could you let us know your reaction
by cable, and if it's favorable, when you would prefer to have
Levister arrive. We would confirm his ETA by cable.

On 7 August 1963 the Station EE case officer requested LIENVOY coverage of
the Yugoslav lines. Arrangements are being made to put these lines in within
the near future.
3. Processing of LIENVOY Information.
The Station continues to receive full transcripts in Spanish from ten
lines (five Cuban Embassy and five Soviet Embassy). DIR-60764 dated
13 August 1963 asked the Station to send to Headquarters one copy of the full
transcripts from the Cuban Embassy lines. These are being forwarded on a
weekly basis. The first group is being forwarded as an attachment to HMMA-22000
dated 21 August 1963. If they do not please Headquarters officers who desire
them, it is requested that the Mexico Station be promptly advised with any
suggestions for changes.
On 6 August 1963 Orville HORSFALL, staff agent, arrived in Mexico
to work presently as a unilateral monitor but eventually as the supervisor of
a tap center either under LIENVOY or LITEMPO. He has established himself
outside and is presently at work eliminating the backlog of Soviet tapes.
Douglas J. FEINGLASS continues to do the Russian from LIENVOY,
the Russian from two LIFEAT lines on Soviet targets, and the Russian from
the LIPAWN audio operation. In addition, FEINGLASS sends clipped transcripts
to the Station ready for 201 files.
4. Exploitation of LIENVOY Information.
1
HMMW-11831 dated 6 August 1963 indicated that Headquarters was
not well informed on the way the Mexico Station exploits operational leads from
LIENVOY. The outside staff agent, Arnold AREHART has instructions to alert
the Station immediately if a U.S. citizen or English speaking person tries to
contact any of the target installations. This is done by a telephone call from
outside the tap center at a pay phone to Robert B. RIGGS inside the Station.
Emergency meetings are arranged in double talk (meeting for coffee or lunch).
RIGGS meets AREHART within fifteen minutes at a pre-arranged downtown
location and receives the reel with an extract of the pertinent conversation.
The reel is then taken to the Station and given to the case officer responsible
for the target the person was trying to contact. Headquarters is notified by
cable of the action taken. Only in rare cases is information on a U.S. citizen
passed without prior Headquarters approval.

Other leads appear in the full transcripts or daily resumen. They
also are exploited by the Station case officer responsible for the target where
the lead appears.

was immediately checked by Raymond GERENDE who determined that the
number was the switchboard of the apartment house where KAZANTSEV and
several other families live. The reason the Station checked out this number
was to put unilateral coverage on it if possible; however, the switchboard was
beyond the Station's capability to handle.

:
Professor WEBB (fnu) of the University of Louisiana contacted Mexican
Communist Jorge L. TAMAYO Castillejos, prominent Mexican Marxist intel-
lectual and professor at the University of Mexico and arranged to meet with
him on 31 July 1963. MEXI-5568 reported this contact to Headquarters for
dissemination and action by ODENVY.
Bartolo (fnu) contacted former Governor of Baja California, Braulio
MALDONADO Sandez on 16 July 1963 regarding the sale of Cuban pesos. MEXI-5569
reported this contact to Headquarters for dissemination and action by ODENVY.
5. Liaison
On 15 August 1963 Willard C. CURTIS met with LITENSOR to arrange
for a sensitive PBRUMEN case (MEXI-5789 reported the details of this meeting).
6. Security
There were no security incidents within the project during this month.
7. Technical
There were no technical problems during this period.
8. Personnel
Orville HORSFALL's arrival is the only change in personnel since the
last report and he is handled as an independent agent by the Station, with no
LIENVOY personnel aware of his presence in Mexico. Robert B. RIGGS sees
HORSFALL daily to deliver and pick up tapes.
9. Production
There is attached a list of reports, cables and dispatches forwarded
to Headquarters during this month.

1. The referenced cables describe two recent incidents in which the
Mexico City Station made use of LIENVOY information to take investigative or
punitive action against security suspects. The first reference reported the
identifying and "trapping" of a PBPRIME citizen who was offering his services
to the Cuban Embassy, and the second reported the deporting of a Cuban IS
agent identified by LIENVOY material.
2.
In both of these cases, there seems to have been departure from the
extreme caution with which the Mexico Station has always handled the LIENVOY
material. Admitting that the cables do not set out enough facts to enable us
to make a final judgment, we still feel a little uneasy about this use of
LIENVOY material. In the first case, the Station sent an agent to the suspect's
hotel, posing as a Cuban Embassy official to "trap" him into revealing his
intentions. The scheme, which was admittedly clever, succeeded, but we were
concerned about what would have happened if the Cubans themselves had decided
to contact the individual. Would not the LIENVOY operation have been exposed
to some extent? We grant that the Cubans and other bloc personnel in Mexico
City may suspect LIENVOY exists, but they do not know it --- yet. Incidentally,
we had no traces on the PEPRIMER involved.
3. The second case involved the detection, apprehension and deportation
of a Cuban IS agent whose whereabouts were learned through LIENVOY. From the
few facts we know about this case, we cannot really judge the possible risk to
LIENVOY. The Mexico Station created LIENVOY and has always guarded its security
with scrupulous care. Has there been a change?
4. Finally, please note that both these cases should have been reported
to Headquarters before action was taken. In general, arrests, deportation,
trapping, or other action against security suspects should be approved by lead-
quarters, except where in the opinion of the Chief of Station, the added timo
needed would seriously impair ODYOKE security or the security of our operations.
The Mexico Station has always done this, and the coincidence of two recent cases
where it was not done inspires us to query you. Please let us know your views.

effectively. As Headquarters is being advised by separate cable, the Mexico
Station does not plan to replace the present LIENVOY equipment until the next
Presidential candidate is named, assuming of course that this will occur within
the next few weeks.
S. Personnel.
On 17 June Robert B. RIGGS resumed meeting Arnold AREHART and
routine case officer functions for LIENVOY. Gregory PARMUTH meets
Douglas J. FEINGLASS daily to deliver and receive the Soviet Embassy
traffic. PARMUTH's assistance in obtaining living quarters and necessary
sterile office furniture was responsible for the case with which FEINGLASS
was able to settle into his outside staff agent status.

The volume of paper produced by this project is hardly reflected in
formal disseminations, operational cables, and dispatches which numbered
39 during June. The daily summaries, the transcripts from two Czech lines,
five Soviet lines, and five Cuban lines are retained for background use in
Station files. They could be more fully exploited for reporting purposes if
personnel were available.

CONTINUATION OF
DISPATCH
SECRET
HMMA-21845
On 5 June 1963 Douglas J. FEINGLASS, Staff Agent, arrived in
Mexico to replace Howard G. SAFARANO, the Station translator for Russian
language conversations appearing on LIENVOY and LIFEAT lines. SAFARANO
departed PCS on 16 June thus freeing an inside slot for use by an operations
officer. FEINGLASS' usefulness to the Station is handicapped by his inability
to transcribe the Spanish portion of the reels from the Soviet coverage. This,
despite Headquarters assurance that he could do these transcriptions. However,
he has settled into outside living conditions with a minimum of difficulty.
For the present, a monitor from the LIENVOY tap center is transcribing the
Spanish portion of the above take. There is a Station backlog of Soviet tapes
numbering about 50 which accumulated during the period when FEINGLASS
was trying unsuccessfully to transcribe the Spanish. The backlog is being
retained until Orville HORSFALL arrives. In addition to the Russian trans-
criptions, FEINGLASS also clips the transcripts for individual dossiers thus
relieving the Station Case Officer for Soviet operations of a clerical task.
After the arrival of HORSFALL. the Mexico Station will review requirements
for outside translators and make recommendations for future use of
FEINGLASS.
In early June to support the AMROD operation, the Station requested
full transcripts of the Cuban Embassy lines. In addition, Thomas G.
URQUHART (ps) while on temporary duty in Mexico was given access to the
LIENVOY tap center to review the traffic on a current basis.
4. Exploitation of LIENVOY information.
Coverage of the Cuban, Czech, and Soviet Embassies provided
details of their personnel, their contacts, travel and other useful CE data.
In most all cases of official travel, LIENVOY gave the Station advance
information when reservations were made. Confirmation of the travel is,
of course, obtained through the LIFIRE project.
The traffic is reviewed for English speaking persons who might
be U.S. citizens making contact with Soviet or Soviet Satellite Embassies for
political or other reasons. On 20 May 1963 an English speaker identifying
himself as Albert Kennedy called the Soviet Embassy and requested political
asylum for himself, his wife and seven children. Subsequent investigation
revealed that he was also a protection case at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico.
Appropriate U.S. agencies were advised of Subject's contact with the Soviet
Embassy.
5. Liaison.
During this reporting period there were no meetings between the
Chief of Station KUBARK and LITENSOR; however, regular contact was
maintained with LIELEGANT and LIERGO.
6. Security.
There were no security incidents within the project during this
true name of a
month. As reported in MEXI-5170, 26 June 1963, the
KUBARK case officer was revealed to the Cuban Embassy by a caller who
refused to identify himself. From the transcript it appeared that the Cuban
Embassy was not interested in making contact with the caller who claimed to
have details of KUBARK operations in Mexico.
7. Technical.

HEF: HMMA-21068, 12 April 1963
1. Returned herewith are two reels of LIENVOY coverage of the Cuban
Embassy which were forwarded to Headquarters by the referenced dispatch.
2. Three conversations, including the SINOBAS/SCANTLING contact on 8
April 1963 have been excised from EC 11, 8 April, for retention at Head-
quarters. The conversations immediately before and after the SCANTLING
contact were taken out so as not to pinpoint possible interest in that
contact.

Quillermo Gomes calls for Vega. Comes is the man who left a letter
this morning, which was a letter Vega asked for. Their business seams
to have to do with passport and visa details. Gases travels a lot and
will call back when in town, possibly tomorrow.
A number of calls show that Heberto Jorrin, the gate man, has a
local girlfriend he sees quite often and who also visits him at the Embassy.
Her name is not know.

Elena Vasques Comes and Teresa Proenza agreed to dine this evening.
Teresa Proenza spoke to someone about a passage to Cuba for one Har-
garita Calderon.
Celia Pascual, telephone 25 10 32, describing herself as the sister of
Sara, calls Teresa Frossa. Celia says she can take some things over to
"Edith" when sho goes (presumably to Cuba). Someone's mother is sick.
(Comment: This could refer to Edith Buchaca, whose preoccupation with
her mother has been noted in the past).
5 April 1963
Ascue in Havɛn calls Nariano Garaia. The connection is very poor and
the Havana end is hard to understand. They mention travel approval for
Rafael (1) Hernandes at telephone 35 44 35 and mention something was arranged
for Eduardo Rodrigues de la Vega.
A woman identifying herself only as Socorro calls for Vega about a
matter she pays ha already knows of. He is out.
An American or Canadian calls long distance and says he plans to leave
wherever he is, probably Los Angeles, Cal., via Western Airlines, for Mexico.
Immediately after this call someone in the Embassy mentions reservations
for Fred Brown from Canada.
Sinobas calls Tomas Marentes, who is out. Sinoban leaves the message
that "Ramon called". (rentes may be the former Governor of Yucatan. He has
a plan to send money or passages to someone in Cuba. Sinobas is very amdious
to help him and makes a lot of calls about how to do it. Marentes has told
Sinobas he has a son working for Humberto Romero at the Presidencia, indicat-
ing the son is at Sinobas's disposition. How much this is a matter of mere
courtesy could not be determined).
Arellano (the Solivian deal) calls for Sinobas, who is cut, and then
asks for Vega. He asks Yoga if there is any news, and Vega talls him to drop
by on 7 April.
Hiss Comes Arias calls for Sinobas. He is out but will be right back.

LIENYOL Coverage of Cuban Embassy
ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES
FYI
1. Forwarded herewith are brief digests of Cuban Embassy
calls monitored through LIENVOY during the first days of April
1963 by Thomas G. URQUHART.
2. A copy of this dispatch with attachment is being sent
to COS Panama at his request because of that Station's interest
in ARELLANO.
3. Owing to the occasional lack of logging, it was not
always possible to ascertain the exact date a particular conversation

B. Material Processed
In November, the LIENVOY LP provided the Station with 131
pages of daily resumes from all lines, 78 pages from the Cuban lines, 47
pages from the Czech lines and 110 pages from the Soviet lines. In addition,
all of the Soviet and Czech tapes were turned over for the translations of the
Russian and Czech conversations. Thirty pieces of miscellaneous material
were also received.
C. Liaison
In addition to the PB Band reports passed to LITENSOR, the Station
also passed situation reports to him on the India-Red Chinese border war.
LITENSOR requested the Station to check a report which LITENSOR had re-
ceived that 22 boxcars of ammunition was being shipped into Mexico from the
United States. (See MEXI 2688)
On 5 November 1962 Chief of Station met with LITENSOR at the
request of Ambassador MANN. LITENSOR had LITEMPO/2 sit in on the
meeting. Ambassador MANN prepared a memorandum based upon a Depart-
ment of State cable which The Ambassador asked Chief of Station to read to
(but not to leave with) LITENSOR. When Chief of Station told LITENSOR that
he was to read the telegram (which concerned GPIDEAL's statements and
position on Cuba) to him, LITENSOR asked if he could dictate what Chief of
Station read to him into his (new) dictaphone. This he did. Both LITENSOR
and LITEMPO/2 were pleased with the strong, definite and concise position of
GPIDEAL. They were also grateful that Ambassador MANN had got permission
to give them this report.
D. Exploitation of Material
Samples of information obtained during the month shed some light
on the private life of Carlos Lechuga, Cuban Ambassador to the United Nations,
(see MEXI 2701) and the involvement of Braulio Maldonado Sandez in the up-
risings in the State of Guerrero. (See MEXI 2713)
E. Security
There were no known security problems.
F. Technical
Likewise, there were not technical problems.
G. Production
During November, LIENVOY produced the eighteen (18) reports
listed in the attachment. The usual large amount of CI/CE personality and
operational material was obtained.

Headquarters will note from the above that three lines were disconnected in
order to cover three Yugoslav lines. Two of the lines which were disconnected
were Cuban Embassy lines, both were not in use by the Cubans. One was in
the apartment which had been vacated by Ramon Sinobas and not occupied by
other Cubans. The other was a telephone in the Cuban Embassy which was
never answered. The Cubans are trying to get Sinobas' line moved to the
Embassy. They have also asked for the telephone company to repair 14-92–14.
As soon as these lines are working again, coverage of two of the Yugoslav
Embassy lines will be dropped in order to pick up all the Cuban lines which
are presumed to have a much higher priority.
3. Processing of LIENVOY Information
The Station continues to receive full transcripts in Spanish on the
Cuban lines (three), the Soviet Embassy lines (five), and as of 18 and 25
September the Yugoslav lines (three). These transcripts are received each
morning for the day before. During September, the LIENVOY monitors
transcribed 1396 pages in addition to the daily resumen.
The outside translators now working on LIENVOY transcripts are
Orville HORSFALL, staff agent, who is used for almost any backlog which
begins to occur.
¡
David B. SCHLAGETER, field contract agent, who transcribes the
Czech take.
Victor W. OBOLD, career agent, who transcribes the Yugoslav portion
of the Yugoslav take.

B. Material Processed
In September, the LIENVOY LP provided the Station with 97 pages
of daily resumes, 11 pages of resumes from the Cuban lines and 28 pieces of
other material. There were also provided 125 pages of resumes from the
Soviet lines and also 74 reels with the Russian conversations. In addition,
there were 18 reels from the Czech lines.
C. Exploitation of Material
The following are examples of LIENVOY coverage:
1. A "George Sherman" contacted the Cuban Embassy
about meeting with the Cuban Ambassador Carlos Lechuga.
Sherman said that he knew Lechuga in Washington. (See
MEXI 1925, 12 September 1962).
2. A "Gabino Fernandez", an employee of the Secretariat
of the Presidency, made an appointment with Ramon Sinobas,
First Secretary of the Cuban Embassy, because Fernandez
wanted to speak to Sinobas before Fernandez went to Cuba for
a visit. (See MEXI 1967, 18 September 1962).
D. Liaison
Briefing papers which were pouched by Headquarters according to
DIR 31814 were provided to LITENSOR. LITENSOR requested a further sit-
uation report on his forthcoming trip to the Far East. He was ready to call
off his trip if KUBARK felt that the world situation was gloomy. (See MEXI
1919, 11 September 1962).
E. Security
There were no security problems for the month of September.
F. Technical
None.
G. Personnel
A PRQ was forwarded to Headquarters for a POA on Guadalupe
Hermosillo Quiroz in HMMA-19809.

a.
On September 1963 a Russian speaking female contacted
the Soviet Embassy and asked for Svyatoslav Fedorovich KUZNETSOV, KGB.
She identified herself by name and as a professor from New Orleans. She
gave the address of her apartment and asked for a meeting. This lead was
promptly followed up by station investigative assets who identified the woman
and learned that she was attending a philosophers' conference at the University
of Mexico. She returned to the United States on 17 September. All available
information was forwarded to Headquarters for passing to ODENVY.
b. MEXI-6135 reported the contact between an unidentified Czech
woman and the Czech Embassy.
5. Liaison
On 18 September 1963 Oliver G. GALBOND and Willard C. CURTIS
met with LIELEGANT and LIERGO. They also saw LIELEGANT on 20
September.
6. Security
There were no security problems during this month.
7. Technical
There were no technical problems which AREHART could not handle.
8. Personnel
Robert B. RIGGS continues to meet Arnold AREHART each morning
before 0800 hours to receive all LIENVOY tapes and trascripta from the
previous day. The daily meetings with Victor W. OBOLD and David B.
SCHLAGETER, the two EE translators, Wey transferred on 18 September 1963
from the Station EE case officer to the KURIOT technician, Gregory D.
PARMUTH who delivers and receives reels and transcripts from them each
day. PARMUTH also acts as a cutout for Douglas J. FEINGLASS.

1.
ASTRACT
Transmitted herewith, for purposes of Headquarters familiarization,
is a typical one day LIENVOY product of the Soviet lines. (Note that the
Station has additional LIFEAT coverage on the personal lines of Colonel
Aleksandr coriyevich SIDOROV and Svyatoslav Fedorovich KUZNETSOV, and on the
office line of Vladimir Ivanovich SAMOKHIN).
2. Except for the weekend period, the Spanish language transcript
reaches the Soviet case officer on the day followin; the actual transcription
at the most usually two days after the transcription. The Station's Russian
language translater transcribes the Russian language portions immediately, and
this product reaches the Soviet case officer about an hour or two after receipt
of the Spanish reporting. Simultaneously, flimsy copies of the above ve been
given to the reports officer and to other interested Station officers.

It is annotated for ZONAR purposes.

3. The Soviet officer, Lucy A. Dillin Ar, and other officers, read the
product quickly for the immediate purpose of obtaining exploitable LCIMPROVE
or other operational leads, and/or reportable intelligence. After this initial
scanning, the product is literally cut up, with each clipping of significant
conversation sent to COS and to various Station officers for their information
and/or action. Whenever pertinent, the actual LIENVOY clip is sent to Head-
quarters, for information or action - or a summary of the clip is sent to
Headquarters in dispatch form. Each clip is eventually routed to the Station's
registry where indexing and filing is completed.
4. The Station finds that this Soviet LIENVOY clipping program provides
the files on the individual Soviet staffers with a rather good picture of their
activities and personality. (These individual files are of course aumented
with information derived from double agent operations, LIEMPTY reporting, Head-
quarters provided information, ODACID reporting, newspaper clippings and other
miscellaneous reporting). In many cases, however, the backbone of a Station
file on a Soviet may derive principally from bits and pieces of LIENVOY product.
