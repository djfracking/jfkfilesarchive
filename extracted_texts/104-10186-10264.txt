In a report dated 19 October 1963, source unknown, it was stated·
that one Osvaldo RELOVA Penichet was appointed administrator of
"Envases del Cerro, S.A." firm, located on Calzada del Cerro
Avenue, Habana..
i
A fairly reliable source, in a report dated 23 October 1963.
revealed that Osvaldo RELOVA, First Secretary of the Cuban Embassy
in Canada, left Kingston for Toronto on 21 October 1963, on
TCA flight number 885.
An official Canadian source]), in a report dated 26 November 1963,
said that Osvaldo RELOVA Penicitet, born on 13 August 1930, was
not the First Secretary of the Cuban Embassy in Canada as previous
reports stated. Rather, RELOVA, who was a frequent visitor to
Canada, traveled as an "Embassy Inspector." He carried Cuban
Diplomatic passport D/63/415 with Mexican visa number OF-7090; he
had no Canadian visa. The address on his passport was given as
15/3 number 2419, Santa Fe Banch (sic), Habana. RELOVA entered
Canada on 16 August 1963, destined to visit Jesus YANES Rodriguez,
Cuban Commerical Attache in Montreal. He departed Canada for Mexico
on 25 August 1963, in the company of Alberta MENDUCA.
A former Cuban Intelligence officer who has been living in the Unitedř
States since 1963 and whose reporting over the past nine months has
proven reliable, gave the following information on 21 July 1964,
on Osvaldo RELOBA Penechet (presumably identical with RELOVA):
In early 1961, RELOBA was an administrator of a section
of the Consolidated Hardware Stores and annexes. In late
1961 he went to see source to get help with an investigation
on a Mr. BARRAL, Administrator of the Consolidated (sic).
RELOBA was requesting source's aid in the belief that source
was still working for G-2; source did not tell him otherwise.
RELOBA is a new Communist who wants to be more than MARX and
is trying to instruct everyone around him. Source said that
RELOBA was born about 1934, is 164 pounds, five feet nine
inches in height, has a medium thin build, a long face, and
a long thin neck. He has dark eyes, black hair, is partially
bald, and has a small, thin mustache.
