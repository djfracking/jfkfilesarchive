2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992
3/8/61
To: Mr. Jack Kennedy
WH/L/Security
Kennedy,
Several months ago I wrote you a letter concerning the Pro-Castro centi-
mants of Court Wood, son of Foster Wood, a local attorney. Since that time I've
seen Court only once, on March 3,1961, and he appears to be actively engaged
in the organization of a local chapter of the FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE,
Complete with beard, Court has been meeting with "interested groups" and lect-
uring to students in sever eastern cities. He specifically mentioned Palinore,
Philadelphia, and New York. Apparently there are a number of students envolv -
ed in this activity; I met David Lacterman from George Mason High School in
Falls Church, Va and Walt MacDonald, a fellos student of Courts and both
are obviously active.

What action, if any should I take in regard to my relationship with
Court and his father?
Please include this statement in my permanent record.
THANK YOU
chael Stratton
WH/L/Reg.
