Status of Document: Postponed in Part
Number of releases of previously postponed information: 9

absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United
States or to any individual.
Number of Postponements: 2
Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.

Gentlemen:
For several weeks in November 1976, I worked with the Committee in the capacity
of attorney. It occurred to me recently that for the periods I was on the payroll, deductions
were made for federal retirement; however, at the time of my leaving I failed to execute
the necessary forms to withdraw those contributions.
At your convenience, I would appreciate receiving from you the necessary application
to withdraw the contributions made by me to the retirement fund. Please return the
necessary application to me at the letterhead address. Thank you.
Sincerely,
Toughe
