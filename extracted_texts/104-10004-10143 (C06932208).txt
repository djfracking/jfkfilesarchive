returned COS Helsinki re Warren Commission inquiry concerning
the timetable of Oswald's stay in Finland in October 1959, including
his contact with the Soviet Consulate there. (Copy of the Commission

Friberg gave me the following information:
a. It takes 25 minutes to drive from the airport to
downtown Helsinki;

d. Passenger lists (manifests) at the U.S. Consulate in
Helsinki are retained for six months only and then are destroyed.
Mr. Robert Fulton (CIA) was U.S. consular official there at
the time.
