15 RECENTLY CONCLUDED EQS REVIEW OF 22INA PROGRAM SŁOWS
THAT EFFORTS HAVE NOT ACHIEVED ANY SIGNIFICANT RESULTS AND
CONTINUATION OF PROGRAM AS SUCH NO LONGER WARRANTED. MAIN REASON
FOR HUDARK FAILURE IS THAT CLEAN: TECHNICIAN RECRUITING PROGRAD
HAS BEEN MISERABLE FAILURE WHEN IASURED AGAINST ORIGINAL
OBJECTIVE OF 2000 TECHS FROM WESTERN EUROPE ALONE. THOUGH CUR
FIGURES NOT COMPLETE, WE ESTIMATE PROBABLY LESS THAN FIFTY
CANDIDATES HAVE RECEIVED CONTRACT APPROVAL AND WE ABLE CONFIRM
ABOUT TEN WHO HAVE ACTUALLY MADE IT TO THE ISLAND KUBARK
SUCCEEDED IN INSERTING ABOUT THIRTY RECRUITED TECHS INTO THE
VARIOUS BIRING CHANNELS, BUT SO FAR ONLY TWO HAVE RECEIVED CONTRACT
APPROVAL FROM HAVA

2 CUBAN FAILURE TO RECRUIT IN SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS APPEARS
DUE LARGELY TO RELUCTANCE POREIGN HI NISTA AND FOREIGN SERVICE
OFFICERS PURSUE TECH RECRUITING MISSION AGGRESSIVELY, BUREAUCRATIC
INCOMPETENCE IN HAVANA, FEAR OF INFILTRATION OF HOSTILE AGENTS

PACDABLE LOSS OF INTEREST IN THE PROGRAM ON PART OF CASTRO
KIMSELF THESE FACTORS WHICH EMERGE FROM OUR STUDY OF THE CUBAN
PERFORMANCE ACCOUNT FOR LACK OF RESPONSE FROM EMBASSIES TO
APPLICATIONS, LONG DELAY IN GETTING WORD BACK FROM HAVANA AND
SHALL NUMBER OF TECHS ULTIMATELY HIRED. LONG TIK LAC. BETWEEN
INITIAL APPLICATION AND ULTIMATE APPROVAL FROM HAVA, WHICH RUNS
SÌX TO HINE KONTHS HAS COST CUBANS NUMBER OF TECHS WHO WERE
INITIALLY EAGER BUT SUBSEQUENTLY LOST INTEREST OR TOOK OTHER
JOBS.

3. IN FACE OF FOREGOING WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT WORTHWHILE
TO CONTINUE INTENSIVE SEARCH FOR ZPPRIZA CANDIDATES FOR INSERTICH
- FISH STRESS.
INTO CUBAN HIRING CHANNEL./STATIONS WITH ACTIVE LEADS SHOULD STAY
WITH THEM IN THE HOPE THEY MAY STILL BE HIRED, BUT CHASE EFFORTS
TO GENERATE LEADS FROM SCRATCH ON OTHER HAND, THERE ARE FAIR
NUMBER NON BLOC TECHS IN CUBA AND IT LIKELY CUBANS WILL CONTINUE
TO HIRE NEEDED TECHS ON LIMITED SELECTIVE BASIS AS THEY DID PRIOR
TEPRIMA PROGRAM. STATIONS THEREFORE ARE URGED TO CONTINUE BE
ALEET FOR SUCH OPPORTUNITIES AID TO EXPLOIT THII IN SAYA MANNER
AS ALL OTHER OPPORTUNITIES TO PLACE RESIDENT AGENTS IN CUBA.
