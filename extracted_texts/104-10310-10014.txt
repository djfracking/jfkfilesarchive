The cryptonym FUTUBE is apparently a garble and FISTURE
is probably meant instead. This is a cryptonym belonging
to LA Division assigned to a U.S. citizen formerly of
operational interest to us. His true name should not
be divulged because, according to our records, he still
resides abroad in the country against which he was
targeted as a reporting source. Revelation of his
identity and of his past association with us would be
dangerous to his security.
The cryptonym KUTUBE referred to FI Staff, now known
as the Operations Staff.
02
The cryptonym HDD SLIVID was assigned to a sensitive foreign
operational target personality whose identity should not
be revealed for reasons of his personal security.
LAURICLE was an action indicator for FI/D.
Monroe B. ROZENEY, Ed JOUVENOY, Wanda CRICKARD and James
N. RABNEY are all pseudonyms. ROZENEY and JOUVENOY are
pseudonyms assigned successively to the same individual,
IDENTITY A. This officer is currently actively employed
in clandestine operations under official cover. During
the period in question he was stationed in western Europe
as an operations officer. CRICKARD was the pseudonym of
IDENTITY B, who resigned in 1970. During the period from
1960 to early 1962 she was assigned to Headquarters and
an African field station as a clerk. CRICKARD resigned
for the first time in March 1962 and rejoined the Agency
in mid-1963, when she was assigned to a South American
Station under State Department cover as a Reports Officer.

RABNEY was the pseudonym of an Agency officer who is
currently active in a sensitive nonofficial cover agent
role in Europe. During the 1960-63 period he served as
an operations Officer at Headquarters and in Europe.
3. Mr. Harvey was issued the pseudonym Daniel M. PRESLAND in
1956 and he used this pseudonym until he retired in 1967. This is the
only pseudonym he used in connection with the ZRRIFLE Project and
.
Cuban operations. Mr. Harvey was issued the alias William WALKER in
May 1962 and he continued to use it while he was Chief of Cuban
operations until he was reassigned in June 1963. There is no indica-
tion in the file that Mr. Harvey used this alias in connection with the
ZRRIFLE Project. There is no record that Mr. Harvey was ever issued or
used a cryptonym.
