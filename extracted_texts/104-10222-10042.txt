Indicate significant strengths of weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective their relationship to
overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment
on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain ratings given in Section B to provide best

This officer is the person chiefly responsible for the Mexico Desk's
deserved reputation for excellence and efficiency. The complicated and
never-ending tasks of project processing, clearances, tracing, and coordination
are handled by her with blinding speed and unerring perfection. Procedural
problems are there to be solved, and the solutions come with amazing rapidity.
Operational problems are worked out thoroughly and conscientiously. No
corners are cut and no principles are compromised.
Never at a loss for an answer, this officer never shrinks from any
assignment and instinctively wants to take over any vexing problem which is
holding up progress. She is complete mistress of file and record resources
and answers all queries within minutes. The most complex budgetary and
planning projects are handled by her with deceptive ease.
These qualities of rare efficiency and speed are coupled with an even
rarer degree of amiability and cooperativeness. The work which proceeds
under her at such a break-neck pace nonetheless goes on in an air of placidity
and good humor. The large office staff is run without a trace of tension,
jealousy, or friction. All of this is traceable to this officer's fine
example and catalytic effect on her colleagues.
Finely-educated, handling the Spanish language with fluency, and keeping
up with current events in her area, this officer is a unique asset to

My husband is currently a professor in New York City, and I would very
much appreciate an assignment in New York City so I may join him there.
I would be agreeable to changing somewhat my departure date from Mexico
if it would help in my accepting an opening in New York City. My reason
for requesting the two month extension is to insure my 5 years overseas
duty so as to qualify for the organization's retirement plan.)

Hdqs and field) and her multiple talents she has been invaluable in the
reorganization of this highly complicated Station under changed

PERSONNEL QUALIFICATION QUESTIONNAIRE
1. The Agency is currently revising the system for machine coding
employee qualifications, thereby permitting more complete and accurate
data on all personnel. The new system will aid in implementing Agency
policies on promotion from within by facilitating the selection of personnel
with desired education and experience for vacancies which may occur. It
is also expected that the new system will provide readily accessible statistics
for planning and management purposes.
2. The attached questionnaire is designed to cover adequately those
factors in which the Agency is interested. Although the information is, in
a large measure, already reflected in previous forms submitted by you, it
is felt that your time within the organization may enable you to emphasize
those qualifications pertinent to its needs. The questionnaire also serves
to bring your education and qualifications record up to date.
3. Your cooperation is requested in completing the questionnaire as
thoroughly and accurately as possible and returning it to your Administrative
Officer within the time allotted.

MEMORANDUM FOR:
CSPS/A
SUBJECT
1 SEP 1966
Recommendation for Promotion of
Charlotte Bustos-Videla
:
↑
+
{
1. The promotion recommendation to GS-13 of Mrs.
Charlotto Bustos-Videla is hereby submitted, Mrs. Bustos-
Vidola entered the Agency in August 1951 as a GS-5 and
rapidly and deservedly rose to a GS-12 by 1959. She has
now boon almost seven years in grade and has been recom-
monded for promotion to the CSPS/□ by WH Division five
times previously.
2.
This outstanding officer has continued to per-
form at the exceptional level which has by now become her
standard of performance. Her past four annual Fitness
Reports have each given her an overall rating of outstanding.
In this connoction it is noteworthy that no two Fitness Re-
ports wore written by the same rating officer. She con-
tinues to occupy a GS-13 officer slot and her performance
cloarly continues to exceed the requirements for that
position. Sho is considered to be one of the outstanding
women who have demonstrated their capacity for further
advancement within the Agency.
4
3. Mrs. Bustos-Videla not only continues to bring
continuity to the Mexican Branch through her long experience
on Mexican affairs, but consistently contributes to the
smooth functioning of the Branch through her highly efficient
organizational capabilities. She has been called upon to
handlo all manner of difficult desk problems She invariably
responds quickly, cheerfully, and effectively. She has been
instrumental in on-the-job training of a number of officers,
both for desk assignments and in preparation for field assign-
ments. She has excellent rapport with innumerable persons in
other areas and staffs, thus adding to the efficiency and
speed with which she accomplishes her daily tasks.

MEMORANDUM FOR:
Charlott 4. Bustos-Viiola
03
THROUGH
:
Head of
Career Service
SUBJECT
:
Notification of Non-eligibility for Designation as a
Participant in the CIA Retirement and Disability System
1. As you may know, we are in the process of reviewing the employment
history and current career field of all employees in the Agency to identify
those who are eligible for designation as a participant in the new CIA
Retirement and Disability System. In this process, the initial review of
each case is made by the individual's Career Service. If the Head of his
Career Service nominates him for participation in the System, this nomina-
tion is reviewed by the CIA Retirement Board which recommends final action
to me. However, if the Head of the Career Service advises that the employee
does not meet the basic requirements of HR 20-50 for participation, I have
accepted this finding without further review by the CIA Retirement Board.
This practice has been adopted in the interest of expediting this screening
process so that those employees who are eligible to participate in the Sys-
tem may be designated participants as soon as possible,
2. In your case, the Head of your Career Service has advised me that
you do not meet the requirements of HR 20-50 for designation as a partici-
pant and I have accordingly made the formal determination required by the
regulation that you are not eligible for designation. From a review of your
record it appears that the decision of your Career Service was based upon
the fact that you do not have sufficient time prior to completing 15 years
of service with the Agency in which you could complete a minimum of 60 months
of qualifying service as required by regulation. My determination that you
are not eligible at this time for designation in no way affects your current
status under the Civil Service Retirement System, nor does, it preclude recon -
sideration of your eligibility to participate in the CIA System if you should
meet the requirements for designation in the future.
3.
Should you desire further information concerning the requirements
for designation as a participant in the CIA Retirement System, I suggest that
you read paragraph of HR 20-50 and paragraph 5 of the i̇mployce Bulletin
dated 30 July 1965, entitled "Public Law 88-643, The Central Intelligence
Agency Retirement Act of 1964 for Certain Employees."
It is always possible that the records upon which the determination
made in your case may have been incomplete or inaccurate regarding your actual
employment history with the Agency. If, after studying the materials cited
above, you have questions regarding the determination that you are not eligi-
ble to participate in the CIA Retirement System, please feel free to contact
officials of your Career Service. They are familiar with the details of your
case and will gladly discuss the with you, In addition, you may wish to dis-
cuss your case with the CIA Retirement Staff located in Room 205, Magazine
Building (extension 2847). If such discussions do not resolve any questions
you have regarding your eligibility, you may request that your case be formally
considered by the CIA Retirement Board. However, this request must be made
within 30 days of the date of this memorandum.

SUBJECT
:
Recommendation for Promotion to
Grado GS-13, Charlotte Z. Bustos-Videla
1. The promotion request from GS-12 to GS-13 on
Mrs. Bustos-Videla is hereby submitted.
2. This outstanding officer has continued to
perform at the exceptional lovel which has by now
become for her a standard of performance. She now
formally occupies a senior (GS-13) FI Officer slot in
the Mexican Branch and her performance clearly continues
to exceed the requirement for that position. She is
still considered to be one of the outstanding women who
have demonstrated their capacity for further advancement
within the Agency, independently, of the experience on
Mexican affairs acquired through continuity in her
present assignment.
3. The comments mado in connection with the four
previous promotion recommendations continue to be
entirely applicable.

Secretary, CSCS (Panel A)
Recommendation for Promotion to GS-13
Mrs. Charlotte Bustos-Videla.
1. The promotion to GS-13 of Mrs. Charlotte Bustos-Videla
is recommended. Mrs. Bustos-Videla entered the Agency in
August 1951 as a GS-5 and rapidly and deservedly rose to a
GS-12 grade by 1959.
2. This recommendation is based on Mrs. Bustos-Videla's
performance during the past three years as the senior assist-
ant to the various chiefs of the Mexican desk/branch, who
unanimously have found her to be extremely competent and re-
liable both in her routine assignments and special tasks
occasionally levied on her, such as country studies, compila-
tion of programs, requirement reviews, etc.
3. Mrs. Bustos-Videla has consistently responded with
intelligence and clarity and has materially contributed to
orderly imaginative administration of Headquarters support to
a most active station. In the process
In the process, she has been instru-
mental in training on-the-job innumerable officers both for
desk assignments and in preparation for field assignments.
1.
For her outstanding performance she received a quality
step increase in April 1964. This deserved recognition should
now be followed up at this time by a promotion to the next
grade in accordance with the consistently good performance at
the GS-13 level over a prolonged period of time.

area of assignment, it is unlikely that a promotion to
grade GS-13 can be obtained. The salary increase is
therefore thought to be the most fitting reward for her
outstanding service.

Notification of Approval of Quality Step Increase –
Mrs. Charlotte Bustos-Videla
1. I am pleased to send to you the attached official notification
of the approval of the Quality Step Increase which you recommended
for this employee.
2. The salary increase accomplished by the award of a Quality.
Step Increase is important and tangible evidence of the esteem in
which the employee so recognized is held. However, I believe the
commendatory and incentive benefits of this award will be partially
lost unless it is presented in an appropriate ceremony which will
afford the individual recognition among co-workers and supervisory
officials. Also, I believe such recognition serves to inspire other
employees to aspire to eithling such recoration,
3. May I ask, therefore, that you arrange to have this Quality
Step Increase presented at an appropriate ceremony.

1. On the basis of the information presented below,
it is recommended that a quality step increase be

2. As stated in the accompanying Fitness Report,
Subject's performance of her duties has been uniformly
outstanding. In addition to her responsibilities as the

she carries a heavy burden in the areas of administration,
preparation of special reports and training of personnel.
She frequently represents the Mexico Section in dealings
with other elements of the Agency and acte for the Chief
of Section in his absence, subject's performance clearly
exceeds the normal requirements of the assignment and of
her present GS grade level.
3. Subject's present high quality of performance
typifies her performance over a period of several years
and it is fully expected that this level will be maintained.
4. Consideration was given to the granting of a
Merit Award but the quality step increase secas BOTO

17 JAN 1973
MEMORANDUM FOR: Chairman, GS-13 Evaluation Board
SUBJECT
: Recommendation for Promotion to GS-14
Charlotte Bustos-Videla
!
1. It is recommended that Charlotte Bustos-Videla be promoted
from GS-13 to GS-14.
2. The performance of this officer has been characterized for
many years by all of her supervisors as consistently strong to out-
standing. She has been able to establish herself as indispensable in
each Headquarters Branch or Field Station ass gnment, usually
functioning as the backbone of the unit to which assigned. Since return
to Headquarters in September 1972 from her field assignment in Mexico,
her performance has been entirely congruent with the thrust of the
Field Station's enthusiasm over her ability, performance, attitude and
growth potential. She is currently chief of the Cuban and CA Secțion
of her branch, and has established once again her mastery over her
assigned duties. She is the kind of sound, dependable, yet
imaginative officer greatly appreciated by her supervisors. In
short, she is a true professional who performs beyond her grade level.
3. In regard to her potential, she has served in the Agency
since 1951, starting as a secretary/stenographer, and advancing
brilliantly with each new challenge offered. She achieved professional
status in 1953 and has spent the bulk of her time since then specializing
in Latin American affairs, demonstrating total flexibility in assignments,
a voracious appetite for work and a penchant for exceptionally precise
and thorough production. A review of her career to date can lead to the
conclusion that she has always risen successfully to each new
professional challenge, and is still far from reaching her maximum
capacities. While she has had little supervisory experience in the
field, her supervisor was of the opinion that she is a "natural leader”.
This has been borne out in her performance in her current capacity
as a Branch Section Chief, in which she has demonstrated exemplary
supervisory ability. Notwithstanding her drive, aggressiveness and
professional aplomb, she is a popular co-worker, is receptive to guidance
and sensitive and responsive to the needs of her subordinates.

4. This employee has utilized her fluency in the Spanish language
to maximum advantage in her work. Formal testing recently confirmed
her high proficiency in that language. Coupled with a comprehensive
training record and her invaluable experiences over a twenty year
period, she has become particularly effective in Latin American
operations and operational support, demonstrating excellence in each
of several recognized specializations, including CI operations,
functional support, reports and requirements, area support and varied
covert action activities.
5. The officer's adaptability, high intelligence and mastery over
her trade was of inestimable value to Mexico City Station, and over a
five year period from 1967 to 1972, she functioned as the Station's
internal troubleshooter. Her duties included the maintenance of
watchlists, screening of travel documents, processing of raw
technical take, target analysis, reports writing, operational support,
handling of outside contract agents, and special assignments as the
Chief of Station's Executive Assistant.
6. The employee is occasionally called upon by the Office of
Training to administer specialized training, and she was chosen
recently to attend the Mid-Career Course ending in December 1972.
Meanwhile, her absence from her new job is felt sorely by the
Branch. It is expected that her current assignment will last about
two years,
7. In summary, we have here an exceptional officer who has
been performing at the level of a GS-14 for some years; it is now
time to promote her to that grade commensurate with her performance
and which she so justly deserves.

Honor and Merit Awards Panel
Request for Quality Step Increase (HR 20-37)
Mrs. Charlotte Bustos-Videla
1. On the basis of the information presented below,
it is recommended that a Quality Step Increase be approved
for Charlotte Bustos-Videla.
2. As noted in the attached fitness report, Subject's
performance of her duties has been uniformly outstanding.
In addition to her responsibilities in the Cuban section of
the Mexico City Station, she has recently been made the exec-
utive assistant to the Chief of Station at Mexico City. In
this job, she screens all incoming material for matters of
interest to the Chief and Deputy Chief of Station. She also
continues performing her past functions in the Cuban section
for the Station.
3.
Subject's present high quality of performance is
typical of her performance since she entered the Agency in
1951, It is fully expected that this level of performance
will be maintained.
4. Although the present Chief of Station was not the
reviewing official on the attached fitness report, he has
commented that he considered Subject an outstanding officer
and has recommended that she be considered for a Quality
Step Increase,

SUBJECT:
Recommendation for Promotion to Grade 08-13
Charlotte Z. Bustos-Videla
:
1. The promotion of Charlotte Z. Bustos-Videla from GB-12 to
GS-13 is hereby recommended.
2. This exceptional officer has now been performing at a
senior level for several years and, while recognition through a
Quality Step Increase was granted her last year, her sustained
performance clearly exceeding the requirements of a C8-13 qualifies
her for a promotion at this time. Subject is one of the outstanding
women who gave demonstrated their capacity for even further
advancement within the Agency and will probably continue to advance
in the future. The present recommendation is based on already
demonstrated ability to operate at a senior level.
3. Subject is 30 years old and has been in grade as a 03-12
for the past five and one-half years.

papers for the Branch because of her innate talents and
established reliability. She never failed to impress her super-
visor with her production, writing ability and energy. Her overall
performance is clearly in excess of her grade level.
In terms of true cost and security-consciousness, she must also
be considered very strong because she has a positive and aggressive
attitude towards these subjects. It is with deep regret that the
Branch parts with this employee who now moves up to the Division
front office staff.

In the 8 months during which she was under my supervision, Mrs. Bustos has
performed in that same hard-working, highly-productive style which has become
her trademark over the years. She understands the intelligence process from
start to finish and is personally experienced with each step along the way, save the
agent handling aspects. She excels in each phase of the work.
As chief of the Branch SA and Cuban activities section; she has once again
demonstrated her mastery over her assigned duties. She is a sound, dependable,
yet imaginative and energetic operations officer, whose performance leaves little
to be desired. While she had had little previous supervisory experience, she has
in this assignment demonstrated exemplary supervisory ability. Notwithstanding
her drive, tenacity and attention to detail, she is a popular co-worker, is receptive
to guidance and is sensitive to, and responsive to the needs of her subordinates.
In her performance of specific duty No. 2, she has brought to bear upon her
daily duties her broad experience, high intelligence-and good operational sense,
functioning with practically no need of close supervision. It is comforting to
know that an assignment given to this employee is always done promptly, pro-
fessionally and cheerfully.
Her adaptability was demonstrated in her specific duty No. 3. Despite the
press of normal daily activity, she was often called upon to produce "crash"

NARRATIVE COMMENTS
The one criticism of this Officer's work that I and others
have made in the past still stands. She tries to do everything
and somethings in this business just don't deserve the attention
she gives them.
I have no personal knowledge of her supervisor abilities,
but believe she is a natural leader.

those of my predecessors, on this fine officer, I find myself hard put
not to repeat what has been said so often before. She has been the back
bone of this section and of those where she has worked previously. Her
work has always shown excellent judgement and ingenuity. A self-starter
with tremendous drive and discipline, the amount of work she has produced
has been prodigious. An excellent team worker, she has never shirked when-
as so often happens - she is asked to take on additional work or work en
a matter outside of her regular field. While forceful, she is diplomatic
and tactful and is able to present suggestions and criticisms in a plea-
sant manner. She is one of the most dedicated persons I have met in the
Organization, and exceptionally dependable. While, as a woman and a
Specialist, she has had little opportunity to handle agents she has done
very well with those we have given her to handle. She has showed great
ability in the training of two transcribers and in the debriefing of two
female agents and their husbands. This is in large part due to her in-
depth knowledge of the targets this section is working on. The past few
months have been difficult, requiring the complete reorganization of this
Section and the termination of the majority of our assets. Under this
stress, she has performed in her usual outstanding manner. Perhaps,
even a little better. Her handling of a great deal of file work has been
excellent, probably in part because she was the one who set it up and has
maintained it in its present very good state.

Without any hesitation I concur with the outstanding ratings
above. Subject is now up for rotation and we will miss her
immensely. For years she has dedicated her entire time to her job
which she has done so well. She has been creative.
She has been creative, thorough and
accurate. Although she has not had supervisory experience at this
station, she has performed in a manner which clearly reflects that
she would have no problem with supervising. A truly outstanding
employee with growth potential.

NARRATIVE COMMENTS
-continued
Three rather personalized comments might add meaning
to this fitness report. Anyone, particularly a female,
fitting the above description of efficiency and achievement
can be, and often is a little overbearing and difficult to
work with as a person. Subject, withall, is a pleasant
porsonality who knows how to make her contributions and
comments in a forthright but tactful manner. Secondly, and
this one is a little hard to say, Subject in her voracious
appetite for all kinds of facts can at times put undue
emphasis on them including factual minutiae as against
equally important but more elusive subjective factors.
Thirdly, this rating officer has personally observed Subject
only working on station premises at an office job, and
frankly has no idea how she might function in outside
operational work (cultivating poople, working under outside
cover).

was clearly outstanding in collating information from all sources

the overall pattern of the PBRUMENT mission here, spotting operational

Subject is extraordinarily rapid and efficient in researching for

resulting memo or dispatch. The same might be said perhaps of some
other real pros in the IA field. However, in addition, Subject has a
good, tough, operations-oriented mind and positively contributes ideas.
and suggestions re new oporational techniques which the station has
used profitably. Subject has natural managerial abilities as recently
demonstrated in her organizing TDY help in a station-wide file and
watchlist offort in connection with a presidential visit. Her Spanish
is more than adequate for reading reports, and handling operational
messages in that language. In sum, Subject is a tremendous station
asset and would be extremely hard to replace without noting a serious
loss in station officiency.

Subject is definitely more than an IA and has performed as such when
the station has required an individual with in-depth knowledge of
station procedures, operational awareness combined with an ability to
prepare studies in a short period of time. She's thorough, conciso
and rapid. One of our hardest workers and most dependable employees.

In July 1969 Subject was transferred from the Cuba Section to the
Station front office to serve as an executive assistant to the COS with
special responsibility for ensuring that the paper flow of the Station
remained under effective control during the period of transition re-
sulting from the assignment here of several senior officers. This
transition period necessitated or gave rise to a number of changes in
the management and administrative areas of the Station. Subject's
performance in this assignment under these circumstances was clearly
outstanding. Her sound judgement, imagination and responsiveness to
guidance not only contributed to maintaining the stability and momentum
of the Station but also made possible an early effort to come to grips
with many of the problems which an inflated Registry and a highly dis-
tinctive records system created for the new Station management tean.
During the ensuing six month period, Subject has recommended and
implemented a number of changes which have produced a more effective
and less costly records system. Paper holdings have been reduced sub-
stantially, input has been reduced and now conforms to basic CS pro-
cedures and requiremonts. Personnel savings have been effected and
supervisory responsibilities more clearly delineated.
To sum up, Subject has made and continues to make a major contribu-
tion in a singularly unsensational area of Station activity. Her advice
is sought and appreciated not only by the COS and myself, but by other

It would be difficult to overstate the contri-
bution made by Subject to this Station during the past six month
period, and I concur fully in the ratings and comments of the Rating
Officer. I might add that Subject is one of the more versatile,
conscientious and productive employees with whom I have worked in
this organization, and that in aitition to the administrative/
management role outlined above, continued to provide valuable
operational/analytical assistance to the Cuban and other operational
sections of the Station. The initiative and imagination shown by
Subject in the very complicated administrative management assign-
ment have been particularly commendable and her complete familiarity
with the country, the language, and the background of the Station
has been invaluable doing this period of INTED NAME AND SIGNATURE

Subject is indeed an exceptional officer who is highly deserving
of the foregoing ratings and related accolades. In her new role as
executive assistant to the CUS she has been invaluable during the
difficult and complicated transition from the old regime to the new,
and the related reorganization of the Station. Her organizational
abilities are unsurpassed by anyone known to the undersigned, and
she certainly merits consideration for early promotion.

Subject's performance during the period of over one year under
review continued to deserve the rating of Outstanding. Her major
contributions during that period were in the fields of operational
research and exploitation of information obtained through technical
means. She was,
She was, during this period, given full responsibility for
the handling of two full time senior transcribers including adminis-
trative matters. In view of the difficulty of recruiting target
personnel the task of fully exploiting information obtained from
technical sources is of great importance. Subject handled this task
with her usual enormous capability for work, displaying initiative
and great professionalism. She continued, in addition, to handle the
other tasks listed in this report together with sensative reporting
sent by a separate channel, altogether a much heavier workload than
is usually carried by one person. She was helped in this by her
good knowledge of Spanish, a talent for administrative work, con-
siderable analytic experience and great devotion to her work.
Subject should be considered for promotion to the grade of GS-14 at
the first opportune moment.

From these graphs you can read for each aptitude category the trobe
bility that a person in that category will perform in an Agency forcier language
training course at an average er bett, r-than-average level. For example, 22 per
sent of the women who obtain an aptitude rating of "8" can be expected to be
verage or better in course performance, while 5 pur cont of the mon with ratings
of "g" can be expected to be avere or bobber in course perforance. A man neede

10 per cent of either men or women who obtain aptitude ratings of "2" can to
expected to do average or better-than-average work in training. The differences
in relationship are due to differences between men and women in both training
performance and test scores. On the average women are somewhat higher on both.

Subject's performance during the rating period has been marked by general
excellence. As indicated in Section B her supervision and direction of the Section's
work relating to intel support, administration, preparation of special reports,
training personnel, etc. is uniformly outstanding. The fact that these functions

Support projects, which she performs with unusual competence, serves to illustrate
her value to this Section. She has an exceptional ability independently to
determine proper courses of action and to initiate action to carry them out. She
has a profound understanding of the area operational program and contributions to
it are imaginative and constructive.
In the opinion of the rater Subject's performance compares favorably with
any (18-13 desk officer within his experience and she performa occasionally at the
CS-14 level. Moreover, she carries out her duties cheerfully, loyally and in
close and amicable cooperation with her fellow employees at all levels,
.
In those aspects of her duties which involve cost e.g. the review
of operational projects, she has given close attention to the
