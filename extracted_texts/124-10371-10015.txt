2. Carlos Miguel KASSEL (also known as GACEL) Castro
was in Miami, Florida from 11 August to 29 August 1974.
3 (5) KASSEL's natural cover for his stay in Miami and
contacts with Cuban exiles was that of "Asistente Internacional"
to the Union de Trabajadores de Colombia (UTC) and "Jefe de
Redaccion" of "Justicia Social" published by the UTC in
Bogota. Since the UTC is sympathetic to and supports some
Cuban exile groups? KASSEL feels his visit to and expenses
in Miami can be fully justified within the context of his
functions as a UTC official.

4. The following were [KASSEL] s main contacts in the
Miami area:
A. Ignacio LEDON Iglesias, former Miami area
committee Secretary for Propaganda of the Partido Revolu-
cionario del Pueblo (PRP), left-winger, friend of Mario

Intelligence Services are aware of his plans and that he has
no difficulty in their implementation. Participants at
the meeting were then asked to contribute funds for the
purchase of weapons; the total cash raised exceeded $1,000.00.
[KASSEL] Commented that it is his impression that the funds.
raised were intended for MASFERRER's personal use rather
than the purchase of weapons.
D. KASSEL] discussed with Ramiro de LA FE the
.
.
possibility of founding a conspiratorial and secret political
movement to create a mechanism of penetrating Cuba for the
purpose of contributing to conditions which would result in
a military coup against Castro. The movement would be
headed "in absentia" by Ernesto de LA FE, who had been
released from prison in Cuba two months ago. The decision
to launch this movement was made on 25 August in the apart-
ment of Ramiro de LA FE. Present at that time, in addition
to KASSEL and Ramiro de LA FE, were Armando MEDINA, Manuel
CAVEDAS and Miguel A. ZERQUEIRA (Cubans) and Juan LÓPEZ
(naturalized American). The new movement was named-Movimiento
Independente Radical de Cuba (MIRC) and Ramiro de LA FE
was named its temporary leader until such time as Ernesto
de LA FE can leave Cuba. The MIRC will seek contact with
Cuban armed forces to launch a coup against Castro and it
will also seek contact with anti-Communist groups in Brazil
and with the government of Chile. Ramiro de LA FE claimed
already to have contact with Patricia -BERDUGO, a Chilean
supposedly working for the Chilean Intelligence Service in
Miami. During the meeting, Armando MEDINA said that he
had once worked for CIA and that he participated in an
attack on a Spanish merchant vessel which was mistaken for
the Sierra Maestra of the Cuban Merchant Fleet. [ KASSEL) (s)
was named [the Editor of the MIRC Manifesto which will be
published in the Latin American press on 10 October.

E. KASSEL) met with Alberto DIAZ Masvidal, Editor-

6. KASSEL's draft report to his Soviet contact in
Bogota is a single-spaced nine-page paper entitled "Composicion
Politica de la Emigracion Cubana en Miami, Florida." It
covers those groups with which KASSEL has become most
familiar: the PRP
the PRP, the MIRC, Alfa 66, and several other
-minor groups. Following are highlights of that report? (s)
A. [In response to a specific requirement from
KASSEL's Soviet contact to determine if U.S.. Government
agencies, including specifically the CIA, support any of
these groups, KASSEL makes emphatically clear in his report
that none of the exile groups have the support of the U.S.
Government, although some groups falsely claim to have such
support. He points out that the U.S. Government not only
ignores the political exiles, but places high priority on
its relations with the USSR and is "disposed" to lift the
blockade of Cuba and reestablish relations with Havana.
In connection with the latter point, KASSEL reports on his
interview with Dr. Alberto DIAZ Masvidal, Director of the
Spanish edition of Miami Herald, who told KASSEL that
reestablishment of U.S. Cuban relations is now imminent.](s)
B. Regarding on-island operations of Cuban exile
groups, KASSEL concludes that none of them have any operational
contacts in Cuba.
-(s)
C. Regarding terrorism, (KASSEL] reports that
Dr. Orlando BOSCH, a fugitive from the U.S. who now lives
* in Venezuela under an assumed identity, and Antonio VECIANA,
a founding member of the PRP who is now in prison, have a
plan of attack against Cuban embassies and consulates and
against Soviet Bloc missions in Latin America, to be put-
into effect when Venezuela, Costa Rica, and other unidentified

countries reestablish relations with Cuba.
out Jose de Jesus QINQAUMA, a Cuban political gangster who
last year planned an attack against a Soviet family in
Venezuela, and the Frente Unido de Liberacion, which was
formed this month in Miami and which announced the launching
of a terrorist campaign against Cuban and Soviet Bloc
diplomatic installations in the entire Western Hemisphere.

5. Following are highlights of [KASSEL S report for
our representative who met him in Miami:
A. The Partido Revolucionario del Pueblo (PRP)
has ceased to exist for all practical purposes. According
to Ignacio LEDON, responsibility for the disintegration of the
PRP falls on its leader Antonio SANTIAGO, whom [KASSEL describes
as a "farsante.
-(s)
B. Mario RIVADULLA, a member of the PRP Executive(s)
Committee who now lives in Santo Domingo, told [KASSEL] that
it is impossible to organize a political movement in exile
which would be capable of influencing in any way the develop-
ment of events in Cuba. RIVADULLA now believes that there
is no alternative but to await a spontaneous change of
events in Cuba and a possible overthrow or assassination of
Castro by the military.

C. [KASSEL] attended a meeting of about 15 persons
on 16 August presided over by Rolando MASFERRER, Director
of the weekly "Libertad." MASFERRER told the participants
that they should begin firing practice on a Florida farm to
prepare themselves for action against Cuba before November,
because he (MASFERRER). is sure that Castro will be overthrown
by that time. MASFERRER pointed out that U.S. Security and
