2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992
SECURITY INFORMATIC
MEMORANDUM FOR: DEPUTY DIRECTOR (PLANS)
'
SUBJECT:
RFE in Turkey
7 January 1953
'r
ACTION NECESSARY: Will you please decide or cause to be decided the
following question: Should the National Committee for a Free Europe
in its approach to Turkish authorities exploring the possibility of
creating an RFE station in Turkey contact Turkish authorities as a
non-governmental private Committee or as a CIA-financed institution?
Background
1. The State Department has asked that RFE not approach Turkish
authorities until VOA's attempt to get into Turkey has been accepted
or refused by the Turks. The Department has now given the Voice of
America until 15 January to conclude its negotiations with the Turkish
Government. These negotiations appear to be leading nowhere and, on
the assumption that VOA will not sain entrance to Turkey, the Depart-
ment has authorized RFE to begin negotiations on the above date.
"
"
"
2. Bob Lang, Bill Durkee and Mr. Wadsworth, former Ambassador
to Turkey, as well as the NE Division have all beer in on discussions
as to how NCFE should approach the Turks. Mr. Wadsworth counsels
that all cards be laid on the table, and he bases his reasoning on
his belief that the Turks will know about it anyhow and that RFE is.
likely to get further if it comes clean. The NE Division on the
other hand hopes that the approach can be that of a private committee
and that no mention need be made of CIA's interest.
3. Your advice on the above question will not constitute approval
of the building of a Turkish station or of operations from Turkey. By
PRO decision at the last hearing on NCFS's budget these questions in
Turkey must be brought back here for approval if the attitude of the
Turks is favorable.

NETHERLANDS
CHILEAN REFUGEES IN NETHERLANDS POINTED OUT AS FUGITIVES
Editorial by N. van Nieuwenhuysen;
Dutch, 19 April 1974, p 5
Reformatorisch Dagblad,
The Chilean refugees in the Netherlands seem to be
having adjustment problems. These rather prolonged symptoms
I seem to be caused among other things by the fact that they
still find it hard to accept that the socialist dream of
their Marxist president is definitely over and that their
country is now being ruled by a small group of reactionaries
who are trying to keep the people under control through
terrorism, repression, and torture. Such problems will take
you quite a ways in the Netherlands and those idealists were
quick to take advantage of it.
:
Welfare
What is the situation? Most of the approximately
250 refugees with a high school or university education do
not work. About half of them have been housed at the "Huis
ter Schie" in Overschie, where they enjoy the sunshine on
the terrace or play volleyball in the yard. Board and
lodging are free and at the end of the week they pick up
another 25 guilders pocket money. In addition they receive
free language instruction, commuter tickets for the bus, and
compensation for each trip they have to take.
?
Do you get the idea that they are better off than
many old people in the Netherlands? You are probably right,
because the Chilean exiles do not have to live on welfare;
they are being paid from the frozen funds which had been
allocated for development aid to their fatherland, Chile.
So you can see how well our tax money is being spent.

may be, one thing is certain, the Chilean refugees were not
pursued only because of their ideology, their status, or
their origin. This is the traditional, humanitarian defini-
tion for a refugee. For the most part they are people who,
in their own country, could be legally charged with crimes
which are punishable under any judicial system.
These refugees carried out activities in Chile which
were against the constitution. As a matter of fact, they are
specialists in violence. This is why they sought asylum in
the foreign embassies in Santiago and why there are so many
foreigners among them.”

Considering that this small group of pampered exiles
is preaching revolution even here and with a full stomach,
it may be useful to point out a few facts. These are facts
which are well known in the Ministry in The Hague but for
some reason never made it to the Netherlands press.
Facts
The great majority of the refugees are not even
Chilean nationals. They are natives of Bolivia, Brazil, and
Uruguay. They came to Chile as a result of illegal and
revolutionary activities in which they had been involved in
these South and Middle American countries, the ultimate
consequences of which they did not wish to suffer.
They felt at home in Allende's Chile because Allende
showed sympathy for their situation. His first action as
president, after his inauguration in November 1970, was to
declare amnesty for all those who "were members of terrorist
underground organizations," those who during the last months
of his predecessor's regime had been charged with bank
robbery, the armed robbery of self-service stores, the theft
of weapons from military arsenals, kidnapping, and attempted
murder.
The fact that some of those revolutionaries received
Chilean diplomatic status was due to Allende's policy of
granting residence permits to this type of revolutionaries.
These refugees with a high school or higher level education
seemed to have no adjustment problems in Chile. As a result
they soon found their way to important key positions in the
government.
The fugitives didn't suffer any sleepless nights in
Chile either, because they felt protected by a militant
Marxist army, armed to the teeth. Some 10,000 revolutionaries,
from all points of the compass, were at their disposal.
Definition
In the Berner Tageblatt, a Swiss newspaper which
is known for not exaggerating, Dr. Mario Puelma, from the
University of Freiburg, wrote the following: "The concept
of political refugee is only of limited value when applied
to Chile. Whatever one's attitude toward the military junta

Grote onrust onder
mijnwerkers in Z.-Afrika
JOHANNESBURG
In de afgelopen weken is moord en doodslag in de
Zuidafrikaanse goudminen onder de zwarte mijnwerkers tot een zorgbarende
omvang uitgegroeid. De jongste balans van bloedige stamtwisten tussen gast-
arbeiders uit Lesotho en de Xhosa's in de goudmijn Carletonville, bij Johannes-
burg, luidt: tien doden en drie en zestig gewonden.
De meeste slachtoffers waren gru-
welijk verminkt. Slaapplaatsen wer-
den vernield, met benzine overgoten
en in brand gestoken. Vluchtende
mijnwerkers zijn volgens ooggetuigen
doodgeschoten.
Tienduizend Baaho's hebben sinds
februari hun werkterrein in Zuid-
Afrika in de steek gelaten en zijn
naar hun veilige bergachtige vader-
land Lesotho teruggescent. Vele an-
dere zijn van plan ook naar Lesotho
terug te gaan. Na de Basotho's vrezen
thans de mijnwerkers uit Malawi san
de beurt te zijn.

menen, dat ingewortelde
stammen-vijandschap de oorzaak is
van de onlusten. Daarbij komt dat bij
de huidige woningnood een nietige
aanleiding voldoende is om de haat
tegen de gastarbeiders tot een explo-

pijen hebben zich tot dusver verzet
tegen de eis, de zwarte mijnwerkers
te groeperen naar de streken waar zij
vandaan komen. Zij menen, dat dan

SHOULD BE CONSIDERED!
A, WHILE STATION HAS CAPABILITY VIA FUTRUNK-1 (IDEN
FOR PARIS), RECENTLY RECRUITED SALARIED AGENT, TO ASSIST
UNSOBER-1 IN OBTAINING INTERVIEW WITH GENERAL PINOCHET. IT
SHOULD BE KEPT IN MIND THAT OUR INTERVENTION NO MATTER

WHICH REFLECTS SADLY ON GOVT, REGARDLESS OF NOW SLIGHT THE

BE FIRST INTERVIEW GRANTED TO FRENCH JOURNALIST BY THE HEAD OF
RULING JUNTA (THUS BIG BOOST FOR UNSOBER/1), WE UNDERSTAND PINOCHET

PROPOSAL HAS BEEN CAREFULLY DISCUSSED WITH UNSOBER/1, AND HE HAS
SAID REPORTAGE WOULD BE FAVORABLE BUT NOT TOTALLY UNCRITICAL--BEST
TREATMENT THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT COULD HOPE FOR IN FRANCE.Y
3. TO OBTAIN INTERVIEW WITH GENERAL PIÑOCHET AND OTHER JUNTA
LEADERS AND/OR PERMISSION FILM CONDITIONS ON DAUSON ISLAND AND
ELSEWHERE IN CHILE, UNSOBER/1 HAS ASKED FOR BKHERALD ASSISTANCE.
UNSOBER/1 IS CONFIDENT THAT SUPERIORS WOULD APPROVE PROGRAM IF

CENTRAL BANK DEVALUED THE ESCUDO BY SOME 60% IN AN EFFORT TO CURB
IMPORT DEMAND AND EASE PRESSURES ON THE COUNTRY'S MEAGER FOREIGN -
EXCHANGE RESERVES. AS A RESULT, CHILE'S COST OF LIVING JUMPED 88%
IN OCTOBER, AND OTHER PRICE RISES PUSHED INFLATION TO SOME 770%
FOR THE YEAR.
4.
1973.
. THE JUNTA HAS NOW AGREED TO FOLLOW THE STABILIZATION
PROGRAM PROPOSED BY AN IMF TEAM WHICH VISITED CHILE IN LATE 1979.
THIS PROGRAM CALLS FOR TIGHTER FEDERAL SPENDING AND FOR LIMITING
INFLATION TO 100% IN 1974. THIS IMF PROGRAM IS FEASIBLE BUT MAY
BE SOMEWHAT OVER-OPTIMISTIC, ESPECIALLY SINCE THE WORLD-WIDE ENERGY
CRISIS WILL SOON FORCE CHILE TO RAISE FUEL PRICES, THUS EXACCER-
BATING THE PROBLEM OF CONTROLLING INFLATION. ADHERENCE TO THE IMF
PROPOSAL HAS, HOWEVER, IMPROVED CHILE'S COREDIT RATING, AS HAS THE
SIGNING OF A BILATERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE UNITED STATES ON CHILE'S
1971-1972 DEBT. CHILE IS THUS IN A RELATIVELY GOOD POSITION FOR
THE OPENING OF THE PARIS CLUB TALKS IN FEBRUARY. THE MASSIVE $4
'BILLION DOLLAR FOREIGN DEBT, HOWEVER, WILL CAUSE CHILE BALANCE OF
BALANCE-OF-PAYMENTS PROBLEMS FOR SOME TIME.

SUCH TECHNICAL FIELDS AS PUBLIC HEALTH AND HOUSING. THE IMPORTANCE
OF THE GROUP OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS HEADED BY RAUL SAEZ, FOR EXAMPLE
IS WELL KNOWN. THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH HAS AN ADVISORY BOARD
DEOMINATED BY THE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, WHILE THE MINISTRY OF
HOUSING'S BOARD IS LARGELY CONTROLLED BY THE ORGANIZATION REPRESENT-
ING PRIVATE CONSTRUCTION FIRMS. SIMILARLY, ALMOST EVERY MINISTRY
AND MANY AUTONOMOUS AGENCIES HAVE PERMANENT CIVILIAN ADVISORY
BOARDS COMPOSED OF REPRESENTATIVES OF GROUPS WHOSE WELFARE IS
AFFECTED BY THE AGENCY'S ACTIVITIES.
0
11. IN ADDITION TO THESE CIVILIAN ADVISORY BOARDS, THERE ARE A
LARGE NUMBER OF "STUDY COMMISSIONS" THROUGH WHICH CIVILIANS CAN
EXERT THEIR INFLUENCE. BEST KNOWN OF THESE IS THE GROUP IF INTER-
NATIONAL LAWYERS WHICH IS DRAFTING A NEW CONSTITUTION, BUT THERE
ARE OTHER GROUPS WORKING ON A NEW MINING CODE, STUDYING THE EDUCA-
"
TIONAL SEYSTEM, COLLECTING INFORMATION ON UNEMPLOYMENT, WRITING A

ONE PROBLEM OF MAJOR CONCERN TO THE JUNTA IS THE POSSIBILITY
THAT PERU MAY ATTACK CHILE SOME TIME PRIOR TO 1979, THE 100TH
ANNIVERSARY OF THE WAR BETWEEN CHILE AND PERU, IN ORDER TO REGAIN
THE CHILEANS ARE WORRIED BY
SOME OF THE TERRITORY LOST IN THAT WAR.
THE SOVIET SALE OF ARMS TO PERU AND FEAR THAT THE USSR MAY BE TRY-
ING TO CREATE ANOTHER UNSTABLE"MIDDLE EAST TYPE" OF CLIMATE IN
LATIN AMERICA.
15. THE JUNTA IS ALSO CONCERNED BY COMMUNIST EFFORTS TO CREATE
INTERNAL DISCONTENT AND TO MOUNT AN INTERNAL RESISTANCE MOVEMENT.
THE JUNTA EXPECTS THAT THE FORNER UP PARTIES, LED BY THE COMMUNISTS,
WILL SET UP A UNIFIED FRONT FOR CAUSING CIVILIAN DISTURBANCES AND
POLITICAL DISCONTENT, AND WILL TRY TO MANIPULATE THE PODC INTO
OPPOSING THE JUNTA GOVERNMENT. TWO FRONTS FOR CHILEAN RESISTANCE
ARE BEING ORGANIZED IN ARGENTINA AND SEVERAL ARE BEING SET UP IN
EUROPE.

EXCHANGE RATES HAS PRACTICALLY ELIMINATED THE ONCE FLOURISHING BLACK
MARKETS IN COMMODITIES AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE. WHILE EXCHANGE RATES
CHANGED AND PRICES ROSE, THE GROWTH IN THE MONEY SUPPLY HAS BEEN
SHARPLY CURTAILED, CAUSING A RELATIVE SCARCITY OF LOCAL CURRENCY AND
A LIQUIDITY CRUNCH FOR BUSINESSMEN..
D. THE BURDEN ON CONSUMERS HAS BEEN HEAVY. DESPITE A
HEALTHY INCREASE IN THE MINIMUM WAGE, WORKING CLASS CONSUMERS ARE
FINDING IT INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO AFFORD THE BAREST NECESSITIES.
AUSTERITY HAS BEEN EXACERBATED IN MANY CASES BY DISMISSALS OF
RELATIVELY UNPRODUCTIVE AND POLITICALLY SUSPECT EMPLOYEES HIRED
UNDER THE ALLENDE REGIME. AN UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION PROGRAM HAS
BEEN ANNOUNCED AND AN EXTENSIVE PUBLIC WORKS PROGRAM IS UNDER CON-
SIDERATION.
E. THE JUNTA IS ATTEMPTING TO ENLIST PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR
THE AUSTERITY PROGRAM AND BUSINESS IS SHOWING RENEWED CONFIDENCE.
CONSUMERS AND LABOR, HOWEVER, ARE TAKING A WAIT-AND-SEE ATTITUDE. NO
ORGANIZED RESISTANCE TO THE JUNTA OR ITS PROGRAMS HAS MATERIALIZED,

FACTORS INVOLVED IN MAKING INVESTMENTS IN CHILE PREPARED FOR PASSAGE
TO HERMES BANK PER REF. PARA 1 REQUEST.
A.. THE RULING JUNTA IN CHILE IS MOVING AGGRESSIVELY TO
REBUILD THE ECONOMY BY ADOPTING A HARSH AUSTERITY PROGRAM AND IN-
STITUTING POLICIES DESIGNED TO RETURN CHILE TO A MARKET ECONOMY.
B. SANTIAGO MOVED QUICKLY AFTER THE COUP TO REMOVE PRICE
CONTROLS ON ALL BUT 30 BASIC COMMODITIES, WHILE THE CENTRAL BANK
EFFECTIVELY DEVALUED THE ESCUDO BY SOME 60% IN AN EFFORT TO CURB
IMPORT DEMAND AND EASE PRESSURES ON SANTIAGO'S MEAGER FOREIGN EX-
CHANGE RESERVAES. AS A RESULT, CHILE'S COST OF LIVING JUMPED 88%
;
IN OCTOBER, BRINGING INFLATION TO NEARLY 450% FOR THE FIRST TEN MONTHS
OF THE YEAR. ANTICIPATED PRICE RISES DURING THE REST OF 1973 IS EX-
PECTED TO PUSH INFLATION TO SOME 750% FOR THE YEAR.

K. THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK FOR CHIBLE IS CAUTIOUSLY OPTI-
MISTIC AS THE JUNTA TAKES STEPS TO CORRECT THE EXCESSES OF NEARLY
THREE YEARS OF DECAPITALIZATION UNDER STATE SOCIALISM.
THE PROGRAMS,
THOUGH AUSTEREY ARE ECONOMICALLY SOUND AND OFFER A FIRM FOUNDATION
FOR RECOVERY AND GROWTH OF THE CHILEAN ECONOMY. THE MAJOR POLICY
CONFLICTS WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT APPEAR TO BE OVER THE DEGREE AND
TIMING OF SPECIFIC MEASURES RATHER THAN PROBLEMS OF BASIC POLICY
ORIENTATION.
L. THE EMERGING DOMINANCE OF RAUL SAEZ AS SENIOR ECONOMIC
ADVISOR IS PROBABLY FOR THE BEST SINCE THE JUNTA'S AUSTERITY PROGRAM
MUST BE TEMPERED IF POLITICAL AS WELL AS ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND
STABILITY IS TO BE ACHIEVED. MEANWHILE, CHILE IS PREPARING TO
SETTLE OUTSTANDING COMPENSATION ISSUES AND COMPLETE BILATERAL NE-
GOTIATIONS ON 1971/72 DEBT SERVICE IN ACCORD WITH THE 1972 PARIS
CLUB AGREEMENTS. TIMELY RESOLUTION OF THESE ISSUES WILL GO FAR
IN IMPROVING INVESTOR AND CREDITOR CONFIDENCE IN CHILE.

QUICKLY, LONG RUN GROWTH WILL DEPEND HEAVILY ON CHILE'S ABILITY TO
ATTRACT ADEQUATE FOREIGN INVESTMENT. ATTRACTION OF SUBSTANTIAL NEW
INVESTMENT WILL DEPEND ON THE JUNTA'S ABILITY TO DEMONSTRATE GOOD
FAITH IN THE TREATMENT OF FOREIGN EQUITY AS THEIR ABILITY TO INSTILL
WELL AS
CONFIDENCE IN CHILE'S PROSPECTS FOR STABLE RECOVERY AND GROWTH A
CRITICAL FIRST STEP IS TIMELY SETTLEMENT OF OUTSTANDING COMPENSATION
CLAIMS EMANATING FROM THE ALLENDE NATIONALIZATIONS. THE JUNTA HAS
STATED THAT IT WILL EITHER RETURN INTERVENED FIRMS TO THE PRIVATE
SECTOR OR, AS IN THE CASE OF THE LARGE COPPER MINES, ADEQUATELY
COMPENSATE THE PREVIOUS OWNERS. SOME 90 FIRMS ARE ALREADY IN THE
PROCESS OF REVERSION.
J. THUS FAR THE JUNTA HAS SUCCEEDED IN LINING UP SUF-
FICIENT FOREIGN CREDITS TO ENABLE IT TO PURCHASE ESSENTIAL CAPITAL
GOODS AND FINANCE THE CURRENT PAYMENTS GAP. IN ADDITION, THERE ARE
STRONG INDICATIONS OF RENEWED INVESTOR CONFICENCE, AND PRIVATE FOR-

IN BOTH 1973 AND 1974 EVEN IF DEBT-REPAYMENTS ARE RESCHEDULED IN BOTH
YEARS. WITH A MASSIVE #4 BILLION FOREIGN DEBT HANGING OVER SANTIAGO'S
HEAD, IT WILL AT LEAST BE SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE CHILE'S BALANCE-OF-
PAYMENTS POSITION IMPROVES SIGNIFICANTLY.
G. HOWEVER, COPPER PRODUCTION HAS ALREADY INCREASED MORE

AGRICULTURAL IMPORTS CONTINUE TO BE THE LARGEST DRAIN

ALREADY ARE PLANTED AND ARE WELL INTO THEIR GROWING SEASONS. THUS,

INSTRUCTIONS TO PCP/SOVIET MEMBERS WERE TO ARRANGE FOR LODGING FOR
MEMBERS OF OTHER LATIN AMERICAN COMMUNIST PARTIES WHO WERE ARRIVING
IN LINA, TO OBTAIN MAPS OF CHILE, FALSE DOCUMENTATION, ETC.
b. SECOND STAGE OF SUPPORT TO CHILE WAS TO BEGIN DURING WEEK
OF 23 SEPTEMBER WHEN COMMUNISTS AND OTHERS WERE TO ARRIVE FROM
COUNTRIES.
VEHEZUELA, PANAMA, COLOMBIA, CUBA AND OTHER ALL WERE TO BE

LODGED IN LIMA, AND, LATER, GIVEN FALSE DOCUMENTS AND TRANSPORTATION
TO CHILEAN BORDER. THEIR PRINCIPAL TASK IN CHILE WAS TO ASSIST
IN REORGANIZATION OF PCCH FOLLOWING COUP D'ETAT, AS WELL AS IN PRO-
DUCTION OF CLANDESTINE PROPAGANDA. THEY ALSO WERE TO STUDY POSSI-
BILITY OF AIDING IN MOUNTING CONCERTED ARMED RESISTANCE TO MILITARY
REGINE, PRINCIPALLY THROUGH URBAN GUERRILLA WARFARE. THERE WAS NO
NEED TO SEND ARMS, SINCE THERE STILL ENOUGH WEAPONS HIDDEN IN CHILE
TO NAKE SUCH RISK UNNECESSARY.

ORGANIZERS INTO CHILE. THESE ORGANIZERS WERE MEMBERS OF PERUVIAN·
