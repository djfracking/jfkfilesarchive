Herbert Hatthews go to Havana and try to influence Castro. Matthews
has a good reputation throughout the 26th of July Movement and could
help in an approach to Castro. A visit by El Murrow to do a broadcast
on Cuba was also recommended. Mr. Lopez) feels that Castro will be in
power for a long time to co.e and that we should try to influence him.
He is seriously effected by any defections and these might be encouraged.
Castro can be hit by defections of overworked and countermanded officials.
Two men who were mentioned as ripe for defection are fufo in Hacienda
and Cepero in Comercio. Copez) also recomended contact with Padre
Alberto de Castro in Caracas. This padre was forrerly Fidel's instructor.
When Fidel was in Caracas he was scolded by Padre Castro whom Fidel
treated with great respect according to Rosco. The Paure and Fidel spent
about one and one half hours alone together at this time. This priest.
should be checked as a possible influence on Fidel. The possibility of
a split between Fidel and Paul should be exploited. Raul is cold and
mean and the fact that he is Fidel's brother does not carry too much
weight.
