The following is a summary of a five page report,
dated /19/74, furnished by Mary Jo Cook, former FBI
informant.
A meeting of the National Defense Committee of
the VVAW/WSO was held on 6/7-9/74 at St. Louis, Missouri.
Eleven identified individuals attended.
The purpose was to ascertain the feasibility
of setting up a National Defense Committee which would
be operational throughout the United States. As concerns
VVAW/WSO, the meeting sought to advise members that the
organization's Defense Committee will take steps to secure
the release or acquittals of any members arrested.
A representative from the National Collective
in Chicago talked about the Gainesville 8 in a derogatory
manner, implying the Government did not try the Gainesville
8 for purely political reasons, but that the leader and
some others planned some kind of illegal activity. He also
said if there had been no Agent provocateur there would
never have been a trial and that the National Collective
would not have permitted violent activity. 17 items
were handed out, a large portion of which were reprints
from national and "movement" publications covering such
topics as how to avoid being questioned by the FBI.
One of these, on jury selection, is attached.

1 on 4/9/64, (NY 694-S* made the following observations
with regard to the CP status of STANLEY LEVISON:
LEVISON has been an important Party member for
many years (and never at any time differed with the Party with
respect to the Party line. His only difference with the
Party has been with respect to the fact that in his opinion
the Party was not sufficiently "militant" in defending
Negro rights. In this respect, he has been to the "left"
of the Party. LEVISON's differences with the Party are merely
"tactical." He has never criticized the Party, except with
respect to the Party's handling of the Negro question.
fact that he does not accept domination by the Party with
regard to the MARTIN LUTHER KING movement should not be
construed to mean that he has broken with the Party in all
respects. The Party today is as anxious to reestablish friendly
relations with LEVISON as it was in the past.)
The
It should be noted that LEVISON never has been
officially "drummed out" of the Party, nor has anyone ever
criticized him for being opposed to the Party's general
principles. It further should be noted that according to
the CP Constitution, it would require formal expulsion of
(D) LEVISON to state that he is officially out of the Party.
SFIOLEVISON
LEVISON never has said anything reflecting that
he does not continue to be a CP member. It should be noted
that it would be in the interests of the MARTIN LUTHER KING
movement, with which he is associated, if he would publicly
repudiate the Party, which he has never done. It should be
further noted that in an effort to renew friendly relations

The following is a summary of a two-page report
dated 7/31/74 furnished by Mary Jo Cook, a former FBI informant.
The report covers the following matters:
It appears as if the Revolutionary Union is making
its move and focusing on the upcoming National Conference, An
issue of "Winter Soldier" was received and its editorial was an
RU editorial.
The VVAW/WSO newsletter arrived from the National
Office and listed three possible directions VVAW/WSO can take:
Anti-imperialist veteran's organization with the
supporters.
1)
2)
3)
A veteran's organization for veteran's only.
A mass anti-imperialist organization with no base.
A discussion concerning the National Office supporting

These findings, pared with consus demog 3, will reveal areas
of underrepresentation. In the case of the Attica Fair Jury Project,
a systematic analysis of jury selection records obtained by court
order revealed that third world people are underrepresented by
34.36, womon by 68%, and people between the ages 21-29 by 83.6%-
This study yielded concrete evidence that the Erie County, jury
system is illegal and unconstitutional, and the system has been
challenged on these grounds..
There are four practical. advantages, to be gained from a
jury challenge even if it does not result in the immediate
modification of the composition of the master jury wheel which
might provide a larger proportion of people from the less authoritation
sectors of the population.
1. pursuing a challenge can gain timo for the defonso.
2. exaination of the jury questionaire and the jury process
raises the defenses's consciousness of what the problems are
likely to be in jury selection.
3. a challenge introduces sone accountability to the jury process
and may change the behavior of the jury clerk and/or judge.
4. a verdict for conviction can be overturned and a new trial
obtained on the basis of an objection to jury composition and
selection, if a later court upholds the jury challenge.
Benographic, model of jury selection.
There are three separate elements to the demographic
odol of jury selection.

ependent authoritarianism ating was very
high just as you would expect from a juror whose values
embraced authority, patriotism, conformity, government right
or wrong, etc. The authoritarianism ratings can further be
used as a reference point to make sense of the body language,
costure and verbal ratings. These ratings become, even more
essential then faced with a limited voir dire.
Schulman, stresses that voir dire ratings should be
done collectively. Defendants and trial. Iawyers should
participate, but past trials have shown them to have definite
problems with. objective judgments in this area.
A core of people from a cross-section of the community
should be established to obtain information about the people on
the venire list so that any inconsistencies between the voir
dire ratings and the demographic ratings can be resolved.
This can be done by asking 10 people to contact 3 friends,
who in turn will contact 3 friends, who in turn etc.. This
should be done with a clear presentation of the kind of
information needed and a clear understanding of what constitutes
jury tampering.

*
The jury a ment is the people's comp ent in the.
existing system of criminal justice; it is only quasi-organized
and partially managed.. the use of systematic jury selection
can be an important tool in the practice of people's law, but
at present it is being developed and used selectively as a
buccessful foil in cases of overt political attack. The
minimal program in jury selection defense work is to secure a
group of twelve people who will take their function as jurors
Toriously and assume that the defendants are innocent until
proven guilty. The maximal program is to secure a jury which
will acquit the defendants.
Since 1970, serious inroads have been made on the jury
system: proposed abolition of 12 person juries, non-unanimous
verdicts, abolition of voir dire of prospective jurors by lawyers,
disciplining of 'disruptive layers and other reforze to
'speed up' decision-making. Juries are under attack by the
narrow, elite group who seek to rule this country only because
this vehicle of the people's power cannot be relied upon to
pake political prisoners of us all..

18 U.S.C. Sec. 1861 is a federal statute which places an
obligation on the courts to assure the right to a jury selected

'dire must be established.
3. a not-work of people must be set up to gather outside
third-party information to corroborate the results of the
survey and voir dire..
The demographic-attitudinal survey is used to obtain
procice information on the monge of attitudinal patterns
prevalent in a given judicial district. At a minimum,, the
following must be covered: demographic information, (age, sex,
racc, education, etc.) organizational affiliations, media
contact, knowledge of the case, political ideology and attitudes
toward core Ancrican values, social change, divergent life
styles and alternative institutions, and toward the type of
defendants and the charges specific to the case. A random sample
of any of three groups will give the defense committee the
demographic information necessary: 1) those who have already
been called for jury duty, 2) the voter registration list, or
3) 1% of a cross-section of the population.
J.v.
The voir dire ratings are constructed by combining obser-
vations of behavior and attitudes expressed during the voir
diro. This procedure is still being developed but there seems
to be a high correlation between ratings of individual
authoritarianism and types composed of demographic variables.
for example, in the Rap Brown case, the attitudinal study
i-pointed the most "dangerous" defense juror as a male
asager, enginder, government employee, or real estate broker,

Klansmen were prosent. The meeting centered
around a Klansman's plan to run for a high state
office. Also discussed was another candidate
for this office.

During July, 1962, Rowe advised that a Klansman
told a select group of other Klansmen that "it
looks as if the Negroes should be stopped now.
This group of Klansmen was told that police officials
had promised them protection and that a high
state official would pardon then if arrested.
This Klansman further advised that if a particular
"militant Negro Integrationist" would appear at
a certain restaurant with other Negroes he should
he attacked and killed. Instructions were also
issued by this Klansman that if this "militant
Negro Integrationist" did not appear at this
restaurant but sont other Negroes to stago a
sit-in, then there would be no killing. He stated
that these Negroes should be beaten with chains
and clubs instead.
6. During October, 1964, Rowe reported on Klan dis-
cussions regarding a plan to handle alleged "race
mixing" at a local night club. Also discussed
was a plan by Klansmon to bomb this night club.

On 5/14/61 Rowe advised that the burning of a bus
and the beating of individuals at a bus depot in
Alabama during May, 1961, was instituted by a local
Ku Klux Klan unit.
On 5/17/61 Rowe stated that the Klan would try
to intercept a bus which was due to arrive in
Birmingham, Alabama, at 11 P.M. on 5/17/61. He
further stated that Klansmen should intercept
the bus on the highway and give all persons present,
whether black or white, an opportunity to get off.
They would be allowed to enter privately owned
automobiles and have a safe journey to the nearest
town. Rowe was advised by another Klansman that
those who refused to leave the bus would be beaten.
3. On June 4, 1962, Rowe furnished copies of five
documents expected to be distributed by Klansmen
in order to discourage voters from voting for
certain candidates who allegedly supported
various civil rights groups.

with LEVISON, the Party designated BEN DAVIS to contact
LEVISON. LEVISON had always expressed the opinion that
BEN DAVIS was the only CP functionary who had a sufficiently
"militant attitude" as regards CP activities in behalf of
the Negro movement. The fact that DAVIS and LEVISON as yet
have not met should not be construed to mean that LEVISON
has refused to confer with DAVIS. As NY 694-S* understands
the situation, DAVIS has been awaiting contact by LEVISON,
and LEVISON similarly has been awaiting contact by DAVIS.
Each of these individuals is sufficiently egotistical to
expect that the other would make the first move in an effort
to establish contact. NY 694-S* believes that probably the
reason why DAVIS and LEVISON have not met is that arrangements
for their meeting were to be made by LEM HARRIS and that
HARRIS has not made the proper efforts to effect a meeting
between LEVISON and DAVIS.
NY 694-S* has never obtained any information re-
flecting that LEVISON has changed his thinking with regard to
Marxism. Even though his present estrangement from the Party
might be construed as reflecting he is no longer a CP member,
there is no reason to come to the conclusion that LEVISON is
no longer an ideological Communist.
JACK talked to LEM HARRIS yesterday who said he
contacted STAN LEVENSON by phone and was given a cordial
hello which was a change from the past when he was cool.
LEM said he had not seen LEVENSON, tried to call him
and would like to see him immediately to which LEVENSON said,
"I would like very much to see you but I don't have the time
now.
I'm leaving and packing for a trip. I will be glad to
see you in six weeks.
11
LEVENSON implied that he was going to Ecuador but
LEM doesn't know why. There was no anger shown, and LEVENSON
will see LEM when he returns in six weeks.

II. BUREAU HANDLING OF INFORMANT
On 4/17/64, the Bureau advised SAC, Birmingham,
to immediately instruct Rowe to withdraw from his
position as squad leader of an "action squad."
SAC, Birmingham, was further advised that in the
event Rowe does not desire to withdraw from this leadership
position, he should be discontinued as an informant.
On 4/18/64, Rowe was advised by the Birmingham
Office that he must remove himself as a squad
leader of an "action squad.'
On 5/4/64, the Pureau advised SAC, Birmingham,
that "in those cases where you have an informant
who is a member of a violent squad...you should
insure that the informant understands he is not
to direct, lead, or instigate any acts of violence."
It was also pointed out that informant should be
instructed to avoid participation in any act of
violence.
III. KLAN VIOLENCE AT THE BIRMINGHAM BUS DEPOT 5/14/61
By letter from the Bureau to 23 field offices, it
was stated that a civil rights organization in-
tended to make a nonviolent attempt to complete
integration of bus service and related public
accommodations in the South during the month of
May.

In response to the Director's inquiry concerning
correspondence relating to the demands made by Gary Thomas Rowe,
prior to his testifying in the Federal trial of the three
subjects responsible for the shooting of Mrs. Viola Liuzzo,
the following items are attached:
(1) The teletype from Inspector J. L. McGovern
dated 11-28-65, setting forth the substance of the discussion
of John Doar, Assistant Attorney General, Civil Rights
Diviŝion with Gary Thomas Rowe concerning demands made by
Rowe. The toletype indicates that McGovern was present
during Doar's discussion with Rowe and on page six of the
teletype McGovern states that although Bureau personnel
were present throughout the interviews between Doar and
Rowe, Bureau personnel made no assurance, promises, nor
commitments to him.
(2) A copy of the teletype from Mr. McGovern
dated 11-23-65, which sets forth in detail the demands
made by Rowe. Because of the urgency of relaying Rowe's
demands to the Department, a Xerox copy of the teletype
was prepared deleting the transmittal data at the top of
page one and the last paragraph on page one continuing to
the top of page two wherein Rowe expressed his confidence
in Bureau personnel and felt he had been let down by the
Department and does not trust its representatives.
(3) A copy of the memorandum as prepared from
McGovern's teletype of 11-23-65 as actually furnished to
Mr. John Doar on 11-24-65.

Memorandum to Mr. Belmont
RE: EUGENE THOMAS, ET AL
OBSERVATIONS OF GENERAL INVESTIGATIVE DIVISION
The Bureau is currently paying Gary Thomas Rowe
$16.00 per day subsistence in lieu of expenses. This figure
was initially decided upon after discussion with the Department,
and with the Department's approval, as it was recognized that
the informant had to be removed from the Birmingham area for
his protection and safety. The Department pointed out that
it would not be desirable to make any lump sum or large
payment to the informant so long as he might be called upon
to testify, as any such large payments might be construed
in court as a payment for his testimony, whereas payment
of his living expenses can readily be justified as a necessity.
In the trial of subject Collie Leroy Wilkins which
began 5-3-65 and resulted in a hung jury, the Bureau was called
upon to produce a record of payments to the informant.
In a
future trial, it is reasonable to expect that we will again be
called upon to produce such a record. The payment of Rowe's
debts at this time amounting to over two thousand dollars
would appear in this record of payments to Rowe, and we
certainly could not agree to pay such a large amount at this
time without the Department's approval.
With regard to the debts themselves, it would not
appear from information furnished by Birmingham that they are
all due and payable immediately, as the larger debts to the
two banks would probably be payable in monthly installments.
We could, with Department's approval, agree to payment of
his smaller debts and monthly installments on these larger
debts as they come due.
RECOMMENDATION
In view of the above, it is recommended that
Birmingham be instructed to submit a detailed accounting of
Rowe's debts showing their basis, when they were contracted,
due dates and a full breakdown of any installment contracts
showing detailed schedule of payments. Upon receipt of this
information, the matter will be discussed with the Department
and their views as to whether or not payment of these debts
at this time would be judicious, will be obtained. Airtel
attached.

Doar indicated in this discussion that the Department
would assume responsibility for handling Rowe's demands as
noted in paragraph three where he said that he would
personally meet with Rowe in Tampa, Florida, and that he,
Doar, would make every effort to build Rowe's confidence,
resolve the conditions set forth by Rowe, and obtain his
testimony.

RE:
EUGENE THOMAS, ET AL;
intentions to continue to maintain this residence inasmuch
as both he and his ex-wife are residing elsewhere.
Informant's ex-wife has obtained employment at a
salary of approximately $223 per month. She has fixed
obligations that will amount to approximately $424 a month
and feels she could better meet her obligations if she were
receiving her alimony payments. Mrs. Rowe has stated she
is to receive alimony or $115 a month and that her ex-husband
is in arrears for a total of $090. The Bureau desires to
know what informant's thoughts are as to meeting this
obligation to his ex-wife. Also advise if informant considers
these payments as necessary monthly obligations that he would
meet under normal circumstances.
The Birmingham Office is to give this your immediate
attention and promptly advise the Bureau.
NOTE:
The Birmingham Office has pointed out that Rowe has
performed an invaluable service to the Bureau and has saved an
untold amount of man power and various expenses in connection
with the shooting of Mrs. Viola Liuzzo. Informant has been
in protective custody of the Bureau since 4/1/65 and not had
opportunity to be gainfully employed to meet various obligations.
The Birmingham Office has recommended that the Bureau pay
informant's outstanding bills in order to continue the excellent
relationship developed. We are presently paying him $16 per day
subsistence in lieu of expenses which figure was decided upon
after discussion with the Department. It is not desired to make
a large payment at this time which could be construed as a payment
to Rowe for his testimony in the up-coming trials. Birmingham
previously requested to submit a detailed accounting of Rowe's
debts showing their basis, when contracted and schedule of
payments. The information received from the field needs to be
further clarified after which time this matter will be discussed
with the Department and its views obtained as to whether or not
payment of these debts would be judicious at this time.

The Birmingham Office has advised that our informant
Gary Thomas Rowe has current outstanding debts in the Birmingham,
Alabama, area totaling $2350.03, and the SAC, Birmingham
recommends that these debts be paid by the Bureau in full.
Birmingham points out that Rowe has performed
invaluable service to the Bureau in connection with the case
involving the shooting of Mrs. Viola Liuzzo, and his services
have saved the Bureau an untold amount of Agent manpower and
various expenses connected with an extended major investigation.
They point out that informant has been in protective custody
of the Bureau since 4-1-65, and as such, has not had an
opportunity to be gainfully employed in order to meet various
financial obligations that he has been meeting in the past.
Birmingham points out that it is absolutely imperative to insure
the possible success of the next trial tentatively scheduled
for September, 1965, that the excellent relationship developed
with Rowe must be retained, and to accomplish this Rowe should
be free as much as possible from the receipt of bills from
various creditors when he is not in a position to make payment.
Birmingham listed outstanding bills of informant
Rowe as follows:
754
Alabama Power Company
Southern Bell Telephone Company
Boothby Realty Company (Apartment)
State of Alabama (Sales Tax)
Birmingham Trust National Bank
·Sears-Roebuck (Toys)

MR. DOAR POINTED OUT TO ROWE THAT THE CONDITIONS
PREVIOUSLY OUTLINED BY ROWE WERE NOT CONSIDERED UNREASONABLE.
ALSO INDICATED THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DID NOT CONSIDER
ROWE'S INABILITY TO IDENTIFY LEROY MOTON AS THE OCCUPANT
OF THE CAR WITH MRS. LIUZZO AS BEING HARMFUL TO THE
GOVERNMENT'S CASE; IF ROWE FELT MOTON WAS NOT THE NEGRO
OCCUPANT, HE SHOULD SO TESTIFY.
MR. DOAR ADVISED ROWE THAT THE GOVERNMENT COULD NOT
IN GOOD CONSCIENCE GIVE HIM AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING
WHEREBY HE WOULD BE ASSURED THAT HE WOULD NOT BE REQUIRED
TO TESTIFY IN ANY FUTURE PROCEEDINGS REGARDLESS OF THE
OUTCOME OF THE TRIAL TO COMMENCE NOVEMBER 29. MR. DOAR
POINTED OUT THAT SUCH AN AGREEMENT; IF GIVEN, WOULD BE
OF NO VALUE TO ROWÈ AS IT WOULD BE A WORTHLESS COMMITMENT
RELATING TO EVENTS WHICH MIGHT OCCUR IN THE FUTURE AND
NOT UNDER THE CONTROL OF PRESENT GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.

Inspector James McGovern, San Francisco, has advised that
Gary Thomas Rowe, our informant whose testimony is needed in the
Federal civil rights trial of the Liuzzo shooting in Montgomery,
Alabama, beginning 11/29/65, had exhibited feelings of reluctance
to testify for the Government and set forth certain conditions
under which he would agree to testify.
These conditions consist of an agreement from the
Attorney General that his testimony would not be required in any
future proceedings, that he be assisted in obtaining employment
and that some assurances be given him for the future security of
his ex-wife and children and parents. He also expressed a desire
to visit his wife and children in the Tampa, Florida, area over
the Thanksgiving holiday.
Rowe's conditions were discussed in detail' with
Assistant Attorney General John Doar. Mr. Doar advised that he
would discuss these conditions immediately with the Attorney
General and requested that we arrange for Rowe to visit with his
family in Tampa over Thanksgiving, 11/25/65, and that he would
then personally meet with Rowe in Tampa on Saturday morning,
11/27/65. He said that he is planning to try the case personally:
in Montgomery and that Rowe's testimony is vital to a successful
trial. He will make every effort to build Rowe's confidence,
resolve the conditions set forth by Rowe and obtain his testimony

This will confirm a discussion of Mr. J. William
Hines of this Bureau with Mr. St. John Barrett of the
Dopartment on July 7, 1955, concerning outstanding personal
debts of Gary Thomas Rowe, Jr., who furnished the initial
information identifying and leading to the indictment of
three subjects on charges of shooting us. Viola Liuzzo
on March 20, 1065.
Rowe's debts totaling approximately $2,350
consist primarily of personal loans at tro banks in Birmingham
amounting to about $1,500 and an assessment for Alabana State
sales taxes in the amount of 9208.50 which resulted from
Mwe's operation of a tavern and restaurant from September,
1964, through March, 1305. The business was a losing
enterprise and has reverted to its original proprietor. The
balance of the debts are to local utility companies and for
apartment rental. The utilities have been disconnected and
the apartment reclaimod.
On July 7, 1965, Departmental Attorney St. John
Barrett advised Kr. Minos that the Department w☎s of the
opinion that the Bureau should not assume responsibility
for payment of Rowe's personal debts. Ho stated that if any
payment is wade to Rowe, it should be for pormal services.
Any large payment for personal services shoot be made
until after Rowe has testified at the upcomings of the
subjects charged with the shooting of Irs. Lizochoduled
for September and October, 1965.
✓
Mr. Barrett's attention was called to thb fact
that the Alabama State tax authorities had an outstanding
assessment against Rovo for Stato sales taxes in theo-arount
of .0203.50. Nr. Barrott stated he was aware of this and
that . Paul Johnston, the attorney representing Rowe
in the action for legal foes brought against Hoyo by Attornoy
Hatt Murphy, had brought this assessment to the Department's
attentio.

On 6/13/63, NY 694-S* furnished the following
information to SA ALEXANDER C. BURLINSON:
On 6/12/63, LEMENT HARRIS, CPUSA Reserve Fund
functionary, told NY 694-S* that in a recent meeting with
STANLEY LEVISON, the latter furnished him the following
information:
The LEVISONS, particularly STANLEY, are still
MARTIN LUTHER KING's "brain trust"--now more than ever before.
This is so despite the fact that at a meeting of STANLEY
LEVISON, ROY LEVISON, HUNTER PITTS O'DELL, MARTIN LUTHER
KING and "the Attorney General's chief assistant". the
Attorney General's assistant, pointing to the LEVISONS
and HUNTER PITTS O'DELL, stated to MARTIN LUTHER KING,
"These men are Party members; watch out for them."
3
MARTIN LUTHER KING did not "bat an eyelash" upon
hearing the Assistant Attorney General's remark, and after
the latter left the meeting, those in the group smiled at each
other. STANLEY LEVISON said to KING, at this time, "I
congratulate you on the way you acted regarding his warning.
You are a real Marxist-Leninist. This is how a true
Marxist-Leninist acts.

Everything that KING does he first discusses
with STANLEY LEVISON and he accepts LEVISON's advice whole-
heartedly. KING also wholeheartedly accepts the advice of
HUNTER PITTS O'DELL as regards matters within the latter's
local jurisdiction.
MÄRTIN LUTHER KING was asked by a group of newspaper
reporters whether he takes orders from "the Communists"
is
and also, whether he took "orders from STANLEY LEVISON.
KING's response was that he took orders only from God.
By reason of the fact that the LEVISONS feel that
the Party has done little, if anything, to assist the fight

On 11/21/75, Inspector John B. Hotis met with Doug
Marvin, Counselor to the Attorney General; Mark Wolf, Special
Assistant to the Attorney General, and Michael E. Shaheen, Jr.,
Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, concerning
Mr. Levi's forthcoming appearance before the Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence Activities. The Attorney General
will have a prepared statement which will probably deal with
the future relationship between the Bureau and the Department
and the kinds of contacts needed to prevent abuse of authority.
Mr. Marvin asked that the Bureau provide the following materials,
which will be used in the preparation of a briefing book for
Mr. Levi's testimony:
so
(1) A general synopsis of major areas of the Bureau
activities that have been investigated by the Senate and House
Select Committees. Mr. Marvin gave as examples, the "Official
and Confidential" files, COINTELPRO, use of informants, and in-
terception of mails. He said the purpose is to identify those
topics which have been of primary concern to the Committees.
Mr. Marvin asked that the synopses contain a brief statement of
the Bureau's position on each of the subjects.

(2.). A general statement concerning the organizational
structure and functions of the FBI, with particular emphasis on
the responsibilities of the Inspection Division. This should
include a description of how complaints are received, the review
process, and any recent changes in the operations of that Division.
In addition, the Attorney General wants a write-up of all invești-
gations of alleged misconduct presently being conducted by the
Bureau. He is particularly concerned about any incidents that
may have occurred during Mr. Levi's tenure as Attorney General,
such as those in Richmond, Detroit, and Houston.

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams
RE: TESTIMONY. BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL BEFORE THE
"
SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES
t
"
(3) A history of Congressional oversight of the Bureau.
Mr. Marvin asked that we identify those Subcommittees of Congress
which have exercised some oversight responsibilities over the
Bureau. In particular, he asked that we review appropriations
testimony going back to 1955 to determine whether we discussed
. topics which are presently of concern to the Select Committees.
This will be very useful in demonstrating Congressional aware-
ness of these matters. He also asked that we furnish a statement :
of the Director's position concerning Congressional oversight
which he has previously expressed in speeches or testimoný
before Congress.
(4) A list of major investigative techniques employed
by the Bureau, specifying in each case whether we seek Depart-
mental approval. The more obvious examples are electronic
surveillance, use of body recorders, pen registers, informants,
and photographic surveillances.
(5.) A list of any formal or informal proposals which have
been made concerning organizational changes of the FBI. Examples
are the creation of an Inspector General's Office in the Depart-
ment or elsewhere having review authority over the FBI, transfer
of counterintelligence functions to another agency or the creation
of a separate Division within the Bureau for that function, trans-
fer of drug enforcement responsibilities to the Bureau, and the
proposed statutory limitation on the term of the office for the
Director.
It should be noted that several position papers concern-
ing such topics were prepared at the request of former Acting
Director L. Patrick Gray which might be useful in responding to.
this request..
Although no date has been set for the Attorney General's
testimony, it is expected that he will testify after Mr. Kelley's
appearance on 12/9/75. In view of the limited time available,
Mr. Marvin asked that we expedite the preparation of these
materials and furnish them to his office as soon as they are
completed. It is requested that these materials be submitted
to the Office of Congressional Affairs, when completed, but no
later than cob, Friday, 11/28/75. They should be submitted in
.
insert form suitable for inclusion in a letterhead memorandum.

Reference is made to SSC letter dated November 7,
1975, and specifically to Item 1 of an accompanying Document
Request of same date which requested all materials contained
in the files of William C. Sullivan pertaining to Martin Luther
King, Jr., and/or the Southern Christian Leadership Conference
(SCLC) which have not previously been made available to the
Committee. Excluded from consideration in connection with this
request were any portions containing transcripts or summaries
or tapes of electronic surveillances of King.
The purpose of this memorandum is to effect delivery
to the SSC of materials in response to Item 1 of the Document
Request.
With respect to the excisions in materials being
delivered herewith, where no notation appears as to reason
for excision, the excision was made for the reason that the
information actually summarizes or quotes from conversations
monitored during electronic surveillances of King. In some
cases it can be ascertained precisely what information in these
materials came from electronic surveillances of King; however,
there exist areas where documentation of the information is not
precise and no accurate determination can be made. Therefore,
no assurances can be given that portions of the materials
being furnished do not contain information developed as a
result of electronic surveillances of King.
In addition to materials not being furnished the
SSC as stipulated by the SSC is a folder classified "Top Secret"
bearing a label captioned "Communications Concerning Martin
Luther King, Jr., Volume 1" which was located in the files of
Mr. Sullivan. A review of that document indicates it contains
information which could result in the identification of confi-
dential sources of this Bureau; data obtained in connection with

(for civil rights for Negroes, and further, since they feel
that the Party, as a result of this "do nothing" attitude,
has lost prestige, they will no longer permit the Party
to dominate or control their activities in the MARTIN LUTHER
KING movement. They are severing themselves, financially
and in a disciplinary way, from the Party. The LEVISONS
and O'DELL are still Party members, but do not desire to be
openly "linked up" with the Party. Although they are "dis-
enchanted" with the Party, they are not quitting the Party.
With respect to the MARTIN LUTHER KING movement, they will
act on their own initiative, and will not accept instructions
from the Party.
LEM HARRIS then advised that the Party, however,
still would like to control the MARTIN LUTHER KING movement.
BEN DAVIS has been assigned to be "liaison or intermediary"
with the LEVISONS and HUNTER PITTS O'DELL. Whether or not
the LEVISONS and O'DELL will maintain liaison regarding
matters concerning the MARTIN LUTHER KING movement is a
matter for them to decide. In view of LEVISON's statement
with respect to advising MARTIN LUTHER KING independently
of Party instructions, it would seem that DAVIS may not have
any success in maintaining liaison with the LEVISONS and
HUNTER PITTS O'DELL. The LEVISONS and O'DELL are aware of
SF10 the fact that BEN DAVIS has been given this assignment
MARTIN LUTHER KING, according to LEM HARRIS, is
referred to by such top Party functionaries as GUS HALL,
BEN DAVIS, JIM JACKSON and CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT as a "true,
genuine, Marxist-Leninist from the top of his head to the tips
of his toes. In the Party, the report is that MARTIN LUTHER
KING is following a Marxist-Leninist line.
If
NY 694-S* advised that he asked LEM HARRIS whether
or not, to the latter's knowledge, MARTIN LUTHER KING was
a member of the CPUSA. LEM HARRIS replied that he did not
know.

For information, interview of former SAC Moore
desired by SSC Staff as he was in charge of the Bureau Special
"Camden Action" involving use of former informant Hardy
(destruction of Selective Service records involved).
The SSC has emphasized desire of very expedite
attention to its request relating to interviews of the above
personnel.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. All of the foregoing listed current and former
employees be released from their confidentiality agreement
for purposes of the interviews which are to be confined to
their respective handling of the indicated former informants.
Upon approval of the above recommendation, and
because of the expedite nature of this matter, the Legal Counsel
Division will orally advise the SSC (Staff Member Bob Kelley
is coordinating for SSC) of the current whereabouts of the
above listed and that they have been released from their
confidentiality agreement. The addresses as given are the
latest available in their personnel files.

Also I am enclosing requests for documents relating
to two of the three former FBI informants who are scheduled
to testify on December 4. These requests supplement our
document request of August 20, 1975 pertaining to informants
(Part IV-4).
In addition, we wish to interview and possibly de-
pose the Special Agents who handled the three former in-
formants (Rowe, Hardy and Cook) who are scheduled to
testify at the public hearing on December 4. Because of
the limited time remaining before the scheduled hearings,
we request that the Special Agents be made available for
interviews and depositions as soon as possible.

Dear Mike:
As a follow-up to our briefing of Assistant Director
Wannall on November 6 concerning our proposed format and
witnesses for public hearings on December 4-5 on the FBI's
use of intelligence informants and sources, we would like
to make the following requests.
As discussed in our meeting with Mr. Wannall, we in-
vite the Bureau to submit a memorandum on its intelligence
informant and source program that could be inserted in
the record of the testimony of Bureau representatives at
the hearing. This memorandum would enable the Bureau to-
present to the Select Committee a complete description
of its program and to discuss the issues of particular
interest to the Committee members. These include, for
example, 1) the size, scope and purpose of the program,
including an assessment of the program's cost and effective-
ness, and the distinctions and relationships between the
intelligence informant program and the Bureau's criminal
informant activity; 2) the criteria that determine when
an informant may be used in an organization or group; and
3) the program's command and control system, including the
limits that are placed on the activities of informants
and the type of information an informant or source is per-
mitted to report to his handling agent and the Bureau.
In addition, the memorandum would discuss possible leg-
islation in the informant area, such as the imposition
of a warrant requirement or additional administrative re-
view. To permit the Select Committee members to study this
memorandum in advance of the hearing and to discuss it
with FBI representatives during their testimony at the pub
lic hearing, we request that the memorandum be submitted
by November 24.

Director Sec'y
On 11/25/75, John T. Elliff, Task Force Director of
the Domestic Intelligence Task Force for the Senate Select Com-
mittee, requested the Bureau designate a witness to appear in
executive session before the Senate Select Committee on 12/3 or
12/4 in the afternoon to discuss counterintelligence investi-
gations by the Bureau. Elliff stated because of Chairman Frank
Church's interest in a study as to whether counterintelligence
investigations should be taken out of the FBI and placed in
another agency or a separate component of the Justice Department,
this particular topic would be the main focal point of the hear-
ing. Elliff stated that the questions asked of the Bureau's
witness would deal primarily with the feasibility of removal of
counterintelligence out of the FBI including problems of a
logistical and practical nature resulting from such a change.
Elliff asked that he be advised as to the identity of the Bureau
witness as soon as possible.
-
-
Inasmuch as the aforementioned topic is a question of
policy, the Director may desire to appear or designate a Bureau
witness to appear before the Committee in this matter. Michael E.
Shaheen, Jr., Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination in the
Department, is aware of the aforementioned testimony and the pos-
sibility exists that the Department may make a decision with
regards to the Bureau's providing a witness concerning this
matter.

TOP SECRET
NY 100-136585
SFIO
When Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING was invited to address
the AFL-CIO convention some time ago, KING, on LEVISON's ad-
vice, first obtained approval to do so from A. PHILLIP RANDOLPH,
negro labor leader, who, if he had not been consulted in the
matter, might have felt that KING's making a speech at the
aforesaid convention was a blow to RANDOLPH's prestige.
11
KING delivered a remarkably effective speech at the
AFL-CIO convention, and, as a result, received invitations
from numerous labor leaders, including "MC DONALD of Steel,
to address their respective unions. As the outstanding
champion of negro rights in the country, KING is a powerful
political influence, recognized as such by the higher echelons
of the Democratic Party. He has access to Attorney General
ROBERT KENNEDY and President KENNEDY, who, politically, need
KING, particularly in the South, where in cities like Atlanta
and New Orleans the negro vote now constitutes the balance of
power, and where KING controls the negro vote.
JAMES HOFFA Teamsters Union "boss" appreciates
the political power of KING, particularly the fact that KING
can influence the 90,000 negro members of the Teamsters
Union. HOFFA invited KING to address the Teamsters Union,
and KING accepted the invitation. Knowing that KING is being
deferred to by Attorney General KENNEDY, and President KENNEDY,
HOFFA requested KING to contact the Attorney General in an
effort to influence the latter "to lay off" HOFFA. KING was
inclined to do as HOFFA requested, but LEVISON convinced him
that to do so would be politically unwise, inexpedient, and
likely to be a "boomerang," since the Attorney General would
never accede to such a request, particularly in the case of
HOFFA.
LEVISON had to steer KING away from another politi-
cally hazardous situation. Some months ago OTTO PREMINGER,
Hollywood movie director, entered into negotiations with a
KING representative for KING to play a part in a picture
which PREMINGER would direct. Although PREMINGER's offer was
"tempting," since it meant "fast, easy money" for KING's
organization, LEVISON realized that for KING to accept the
offer would lower the latter's prestige. After convincing
KING of this fact, LEVISON personally telephoned to PREMINGER,
telling him that "the deal was off."

John T. Elliff, Domestic Task Force Director of the
Senate Select Committee, advised at 9:15 a.m. on 12/3/75 that .
the following is a statement to be read by Senator Frank Church
of that Committee on 12/3/75.
Boy
Attorney General Kennedy authorized wiretaps in
1962 on New York Times reporter Hanson Baldwin and his
secretary and that lasted for about one month. In addition
to the wiretap on New York Times reporter Hanson Baldwin in
1962, the Committee has received materials from the FBI re-
flecting authorization by Attorney General Kennedy of a
wiretap on a reporter for Newsweek Magazine in 1961 during
the investigation of another leak of classified information.
Further materials reflected authorization by Attorney General
Nicholas Katzenbach for a wiretap on the editor of an anti-
Communist newsletter in 1965, also during the investigation
of a leak of classified information. The Committee has received
materials from the FBI reflecting authorization by Attorney
General Robert F. Kennedy of wiretaps on at least six American
citizens, including three Executive Branch officials, a Con-
gressional Staff Member, and two registered lobbying agents
for foreign interests. The materials also reflect that these
wiretaps relate to an investigation of agents by foreign in-
terests to influence United States economic policies.
Elliff was advised by SA Paul V. Daly of this Division
that an impression would be created by the aforementioned statement
that this Bureau may have conducted an electronic surveillance on
Capitol Hill and that this, of course, was inaccurate. The elec-
tronic surveillance concerning the Congressional Staff Member was
not located on Congressional property. Elliff agreed with this
observation and indicated that he would check the material to
insure the electronic surveillance in question was not on Con-
gressional property and as agreed, make a change in the afore-
mentioned statement.

What LEVISON particularly wanted GUS HALL to knew
is that "KING is a wholehearted Marxist, who has studied
it (Marxism), believes in it, and agrees with it, but because
of his being a minister of religion, does not dare to espouse
it publicly."
GUS HALL, according to HARRIS, was "elated" to

the National Committee of the CP, USA. HALL further
remarked that O'DELL is a "brain-trust" for LUTHER KING
and is doing an excellent job.

MARTIN LUTHER KING movement could be organized in
Louisiana, the State Senatorial District where CAULFIELD
resides permanently (Lettsworth, Louisiana), CAULFIELD
might be furnished as much as $1,000.00 per month to
promote this movement. The funds are to come from the
MARTIN LUTHER KING movement and the object is to get
every éligible Negro to register to vote. CAULFIELD
reportedly met MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., while in Atlanta,
and discussed with him the voter registration matter in
Louisiana.
On 4/27/62, a pretext telephone call was made
to UN 6-2000, which is the NYC listing for the Committee to
Defend MARTIN LUTHER KING and also the listing for the
SCLC at 312 West 125th Street, NYC. The pretext used was
that of a person interested in contributing money to the
KING committee. The person answering the phone during
the conversation identified himself as JACK O'DELL, and
furnished the following information:
His office is the Northern Branch of the SCLC.
The Committee to Defend MARTIN LUTHER KING, at 312 West
125th Street, was organized as an "ad hoc" committee to
assist in the KING defense, when he was the subject of
court action. When the reason for this committee's
being in existence was removed, it was formally dissolved.
The same personalities them formed the Committee to Aid
the Southern Freedom Struggle, which is now operated at
312 West 125th Street.
O'DELL stated that it would make no difference
as to whether a person contributing money makes out checks
payable to the Committee to Defend MARTIN LUTHER KING, the
SCLC or the Committee to Aid the Southern Freedom Struggle,
because they are all one and the same.

NY 3575-S* advised on 6/20/62, that STANLEY
LEVISON stated that/in a recent conversation with MARTIN
LUTHER KING, KING said he was thinking of getting another
administrative assistant. LÉVISON stated that in the
past LEVISON had not considered it wise for O'DELL to
take on such a position, but he is the only one who could
do the job and should be considered for it. LEVISON stated
as long as O'DELL did not have the title of Executive
Director, there would not be "as much lightening flashing
around him". O'DELL could be called a coordinator and
still fulfill all the duties of Executive Director.
,ELSUR
LEVISON stated, according to NY 3575-s*
that
KING liked LEVISON's suggestion with respect to O'DELL
taking this position, because KING felt that O'DELL
must face it sooner or later, stating "that no matter
what a man was, if he could stand up now and say he is
not connected, then as far as I am concerned, he is eligible
to work for me".

A "note" attached to the application stated that
the committee was created by resolution as an unincorporated
association at an organizing meeting held at the home of
HARRY BELAFONTE, 300 West End Avenue, in June, 1960.
The application for exemption from the New York City

Committee to Aid the Southern Freedom Struggle, 312 West 125th

NY has considered the above facts and is of the
opinion that a Cominfil investigation of the NY Chapter
of the SCLC is warranted, due to the dominant CP influence
on the executives of the NY Chapter of the SCLC.
NY will conduct no further investigation without
prior Bureau authority.

As a follow-up to our briefing of Assistant Director
Wannall on November 6 concerning our proposed format and
witnesses for public hearings on December 4-5 on the FBI's
use of intelligence informants and sources, we would like
to make the following requests.
As discussed in our meeting with Mr. Wannall, we in-
vite the Bureau to submit a memorandum on its intelligence
informant and source program that could be inserted in
the record of the testimony of Bureau representatives at
the hearing. This memorandum would enable the Bureau to
present to the Select Committee a complete description
of its program and to discuss the issues of particular
“interest to the Committee members. These include, for
example, 1) the size, scope and purpose of the program,
including an assessment of the program's cost and effective-
ness, and the distinctions and relationships between the
intelligence informant program and the Bureau's criminal
informant activity; 2) the criteria that determine when
an informant may be used in an organization or group; and
3) the program's command and control system, including the
limits that are placed on the activities of informants
and the type of information an informant or source is per-
mitted to report to his handling agent and the Bureau.
In addition, the memorandum would discuss possible leg-
islation in the informant area, such as the imposition
of a warrant requirement or additional administrative re-
view. To permit the Select Committee members to study this
memorandum in advance of the hearing and to discuss it
with FBI representatives during their testimony at the pub-
lic hearing, we request that the memorandum be submitted
by November 24.

Assoc. Dir.
Reference is made to SSC requests contained in letter
of Senator Frank Church dated November 7, 1975, for materials
concerning Martin Luther King, Jr.
The purpose of this memorandum is to effect delivery
to the SSC of information and materials in response to requests
contained in the above SSC letter.
The attention of the SSC is invited to FBI memorandum
dated November 11, 1975, which referred to a highly sensitive
oral briefing furnished to Senator Church and selected members
of the SSC Staff by FBI personnel on November 5, 1975. This
briefing was intended, in part, to serve in lieu of any
written information in response to SSC requests for communi-
cations documenting Stanley David Levison as a secret member
of the Communist Party, USA (CPUSA).
Because of SSC insistence in requesting items to
establish factual basis for Levison's secret CPUSA membership,
as set forth in referenced SSC letter, our New York office
was contacted for documents representing original recordings
from Bureau informants concerning Levison. As a result our
New York office provided the material which is now being
delivered and which has served as a basis for statements in
various FBI documents that Levison was a secret member of
the CPUSA.

It is noted that referenced SSC letter requested un-
excised copies of the February 22, and June 12, 1962, communi-
cations from New York which appear to have been the "articulated
predicates for the cominfil" case." The SSC letter did not
identify captions of these communications; nor identify any
specific "cominfil case. Therefore, we were unable to locate
any pertinent documents bearing these dates in our Headquarters'
files. At a meeting on November 12, 1975, between SSC Staff
Member Michael Epstein and representatives of the Intelligence
Division of the FBI, it was agreed that the two documents
apparently referred to above are New York airtel dated February 12,
1962, captioned "Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.; SM-C" and New York
letter dated August 21, 1962, captioned "Communist Infiltration
of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference; IS-C."
New York airtel dated February 12, 1962, is being
delivered with this memorandum among those documents received
from our New York office. Excisions in this document are
fewer than those made in a copy previously provided the SSC.
copy bearing no or fewer excisions cannot be provided the SSC
for reasons made clear during the oral briefing of Senator
Church and selected SSC Staff members on November 5, 1975.

It is noted that New York letter dated August 21, 1962,
which is being delivered with this memorandum, is not believed
to have been previously provided the SSC.

Reference is further made to our memoranda dated
July 17, 1975, and September 25, 1975, which provided background
information and documents pertaining to the SI, ADEX, and RI.
As you are aware, a computerized ADBX listing is pres
pared monthly at FBINQ. The SI list was prepared in the same
manner and, as with the former SI, when a new monthly ADEX list
is prepared copies of the old list are destroyed inasmuch as they
are outdated and no longer serve a useful purpose. As you have
been previously advised, names appearing on the formor SI and
the ADCX have been printed on 5 X 8 cards with a single name
printed on each card. Background information, file numbers, and
type of activity in which the individual is engaged are also
placed on these cards. As you are aware, approximately 15,000 of
these cards, all outdated, have been located as FBIHQ. These
cards include some which contain the identity of individuals who
were maintained on the Priority III level of the former SI and
all AÐBÁ cards deleted or cancelled since its inception.
During the initial period of establishing the ADEX, in
order to obviate the need for conducting massive file reviews,
the ADEX consisted primarily of the identity of those individuals
who had been maintained on the former SI. Although these names
were originally placed in this manner on the new ADEX, as cases
were reviewed under our then existing reporting procedures, each
case was to be reviewed on its own merits utilizing the then
current criteria for ADEX to determine whether continued in-
clusion on the ADEX was warranted. If not, the individual's

Reference is made to my letter dated July 1, 1975, which
enclosed a memorandum of the same date relating to a request for
documentary materials made by the Senate Select Committee (SSC)
under the date of May 14, 1975.
The referenced memorandum, on page 1, paragraph 4,
refers to a briefing by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover to the National
Security Council, presided over by the President, on November 6,
1958. A further review of our records has determined this briefing
by Mr. Hoover was actually furnished to the President and members
of his Cabinet on November 6, 1958. Although it is likely members
of the National Security Council were present, technically it was a
briefing of the President and his Cabinet.

Attached for your approval and forwarding to the Committee
is the original of a memorandum correcting this technical error and
requesting the Committee appropriately change its records.

OPERATIONS WITH RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)
name was deleted. As previously indicated, during 1972 the ADEX
was evaluated and revised. Following this revision, the number
of individuals who were included on the ADEX began to decline
and thus the high number of cancelled cards. In accordance with
Bureau policy, which was instituted during the SI program, these
cancelled cards are maintained at FBIIIQ for a period of three
years and there is no way to reconstuct a formor SI or ADEX list
for a particular time period by reviewing these cancelled cards.
These cards, however, will reflect the identity of those in-
dividuals who have been placed on the SI and the ADEX for the
period for which these cards were maintained.
Por your request, these outdated SI and ADEX cards
are available for review by appropriate SSC representives
at FBIHQ. In this regard, SSC Staff Members Martha Talley and
John F. Elliff have had access to these cards on October 30,
1975, and November 7, 1975, respectively.
During Mr. Elliff's review of these cards, the names
Shelley Blum, Emanuel James Brisker, Jr., and Gregory Allan
Calvert were selected by Mr. Elliff in connection with request
number two of your October 28, 1975, letter. Documents re-
quested regarding these individuals are enclosed.
A review of pertinent files at FBIHQ regarding the SI
and the RI indicates there are no other versions of the former
SI or RI at FBIHQ. Contact was also made with knowledgeable
individuals of our New York City Field Office and it was doter-
mined these programs had been handled in accordance with thon
existing FBIHQ policy and no other versions of these programs
were compiled by that office.
Materials requested for delivery under item number
four of your October 28, 1975, letter are enclosed. In this ra-
gard, it is noted the correct FBIHQ file number for the Emma
Lazarus Federation of Jewish Women's Clubs is 100-400394 and
the correct file number for the file regarding Communist Infil-
tration of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People is 61-3176. In order to be responsive to your
request, pertinent documents of the typo desired are being fur-
nished regarding these organizations from these files.

Reference is made to memorandum dated July 1, 1975,
which responded to a SSC request under the date of May 14, 1975,
for documents relating to this Bureau's former Counterintelligence
Programs (Cointelpros).
Page 1, paragraph 4, of referenced memorandum refers
to a briefing by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover to the National Secu-
rity Council, presided over by the President, November 6, 1958.
Enclosed with the memorandum was a document with a cover page
alluding to this briefing of the National Security Council.
A current review of the records of this Bureau has deter-
mined the briefing by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover on November 6,
1958, was actually furnished to the President and members of his
Cabinet. Although it may be presumed that some members of the
Cabinet were also members of the National Security Council, it is
requested you correct your records to more accurately indicate the
true nature of the briefing.
This is also to confirm information orally furnished by
Supervisor David Ryan of the FBI to SSC staff member Barbara
Banoff on November 13, 1975, at SSC offices. At that time,

Reference is made to a memorandum dated 11/12/75
from Legal Counsel to Mr. J. B. Adams, Deputy Associate Director,
in which a recommendation was made that the Intelligence Division
determine whether there is a memorandum describing a briefing of
former Attorney General Ramsey Clark by Mr. Cartha DeLoach,
former Assistant to the Director, concerning the Counterintelligence
Program.
Mr. DeLoach, during an interview under oath by staff
members of the Senate Select Committee on 11/11/75, advised that
he had briefed Ramsey Clark regarding the Counterintelligence
Program and, when asked whether he had written a memorandum
regarding that briefing, advised that he could not specifically recall
whether a memorandum was prepared. During the interview by
Committee staff members, they advised Mr. DeLoach that they had
asked for such documentation from the Bureau, but a memorandum
indicating Mr. DeLoach had briefed Ramsey Clark regarding the
Counterintelligence Program was not received among the documents
furnished by the Bureau

Attached for your approval and forwarding to the SSC is

Although this Bureau has declassified the documents as
requested by the SSC, you should note that one of these documents
consists of excerpts from former FBI Director Hoover's briefing of
the President and his Cabinet on November 6, 1958, and a second
document is a memorandum to Mr. J. Edgar Hoover from Attorney
General Nicholas DeB. Katzenbach dated September 3, 1965. You
may desire to clear the declassification of the former with the White
House and to afford your consideration to the declassification of the
latter which originated within the Department.

DATE 12/27/005
I want you to know how much I appreciated the
opportunity to meet with you and your associates the other
day about the Martin Luther King, Jr. case. It was most
helpful to have the benefit of the Bureau's knowledge con-
cerning the background of the case, and I can assure you
that we will do everything possible to avoid joepardizing
any sensitive FBI sources or ongoing operations.
It
I do want to reiterate our need for the specific
items set forth in earlier document requests which would
presumably establish the factual basis for your conclusion
as of various dates in 1962, 1963 and 1964 that Stanley
Levison was a "secret member of the Communist Party, USA.
Of course in the event that there is no particular document
in any of those years wherein Levison was so-identified to
the FBI, I think it would be helpful for you to let us know
so that we may consider our outstanding requests in that
context. Finally, of course, we still need unexcised copies
of the February 22 and June 12, 1962 communications from
New York which appear to have been the articulated predicates
for the "cominfil" case. ☐
Once again, I want to thank you for your time and
I look forward to hearing from you further on this subject.

Brasilia, and Buenos Aires, were not the type of Legat

Mexico City Logat's operations were more of the type of
interest to them. Aaron asked pointed questions
concerning the mechanics of Legat reporting on
intelligence information developed locally to FBIHQ and
the local coordination of this information with the
Embassy components. Aaron requested the Legat provide
him with the general nature of intelligence developed
and reported by the Legat to the Embassy and FBIHQ.
was told that generally international and local terrorism
wore the prime topics of Legat reporting. Inquiry was
also made into the reason for FBI expansion of foreign
liaison activities in 1070. He was told that the Legat
was not personally aware of any special reason other than
that the FBI liaison operations required additional
personnel and Aaron was referred to FBIHQ for any
additional information in this regard. Legat was asked
whether the CIA Station had ever requested Legat to secure
data from FBI computer banks on Argentine residents of
CIA interest who had previously resided in the U. S.
Legat's reply was in the negative. Other questions mainly
dealt with cooperation and coordination activities between
the FDI and the CIA at the Embassy. Inquiry was also mado
into the relationship of the Drug Enforcement Agency and
FDI overseas. The interview lasted approximately thirty-
five minutes.
Upon arrival in Buenos Aires, Mr. Aaron was
suffering from an intestinal problem and remained in his
Duenos Aires hotel on September 25, 1075. The Charge D'
Affaires hosted a small lunchcon for forner Ambassador
Truchart on that date which Legat, Duenos Aires, attended.

On September 19, 1975, Mr. David Aaron, an
investigator for SSC was briefed at FBI Headquarters
(FBI) in preparation for his planned visit to
Drasilia, Brazil, on September 22, 1975, and
Buenos Aires, Argentina, on September 25, 1975, in
connection with the Committee's inquiry into U. s.
intelligence activities. Vr. Akron was briefed on
the overall role and mission of the FBI's Legal Attaches
(Legats), and specifically on the activities and
functions of the Legats at Brasilia and Buenos Aires.
He was advised that Legat, Brasilia, utilized two
confidential sources in order to facilitate the prompt
coverage of Leads in Brazil. He was also told that
Logat, Mexico City, and Legat, Brasilia, were the only
Legat offices that utilized paid confidential sources. (S)
Legat, Buenos Aires, informed FBIH) that the
U. S. Embassy at Buenos Aires received instructions,
classified "Secret," from the U. S. Department of State
with regard to the visit of farid Aaron, a former U. 6.
Department of State Foreign Service Officer, and
William Truchart, a former U. S. Ambassador, to the
D. S. Embassies at trasilia, Buenos Aires, and Montevideo

RE: VISITS OF SSC STAFF
MEMBERS TO FBI
LEGAL ATTACHES
Department of State advised that the primary objective of
the visitors was to discuss with the Ambassador and
members of his staff the relationships and exercise of
authority by the Ambassador of the intelligence activities
in the field. The Department of State further advised that
operational details, sources and methods were not construed
to be legitimate avenues of inquiry by the SSC Staff
Members.
Legat, Brasilia, was interviewed on September 22,
1975, by Messrs. Aaron and Truehart, with Aaron being
dominant in the interviewing process. The interview was
directed mainly toward attempts to elicit examples whereby
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had withheld dissemination
of information of interest to other agencies. Inquiries
were made concerning CIA activities inside and outside the
Embassy. Specific questions were placed with Legat to
ascertain if the FBI was involved in Soviet Embassy
"walk-ins" as well as recruitment of double agents and CIA-
oriented operations. Discussion concerning Legat's role
and functions in Brasilia appeared to be routine, with few,
if any, pointed questions directed at FBI operations
overseas. The subject of two paid confidential sources in
Brasilia was briefly discussed and both SSC investigators
appeared understanding and in agreement with the necessity
of each confidential source to serve FBI's and U. S.
Government's best interests in Brazil. The question
seemingly bearing the most weight during the interview
concerned possible unauthorized activities of CIA and its
lack of cooperation and coordination with FBI and the
Defense Attache's Office. The duration of the interview
was approximately forty-five minutes.

Legat, Buenos Aires, was interviewed by the two
SSC Staff Members on September 26, 1975. Again Aaron
played the dominant role during interview.

Re: U. S. Senate Select Committee

time allotted, appear to represent a disadvantage to all
parties concerned, including the Committee. It was pointed
out that the FBI, in particular, would have considerable
difficulty in presenting a comprehensive and valid picture
of its own CI operations under the conditions imposed by
such a session. Mr. Elliff, after considering these
objections, stated that he could understand the FBI
position but was somewhat doubtful considering the pressures
under which the Committee was operating that he would be
able to alter this situation.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re:
U. S. Senate Select Committee
on Intelligence Activities (SSC)
2. Counter-subversion
In this category Mr. Elliff indicated a particular
interest in foreign influence in domestic groups and the
assessment of danger/risk in investigations undertaken to
detect such influence. He brought up the disclosures of
surveillances by CIA of Americans abroad at the request of
the FBI. He also indicated an interest in borderline cases,
such as those in which domestic counter-subversion
investigations develop a CI aspect, and was particularly
interested in the policies and coordinating mechanisms
affecting such instances.
3. Positive intelligence collection
In this category Mr. Elliff was interested in
the responsibility for collection of positive intelligence
within the United States and the apparent gap which existed
in this field. He was also interested in situations under
which the FBI might target friendly foreign intelligence
services in the United States for CI attention.
Considerable discussion was held during the
conference during which INTD representatives set forth the
FBI's position and experience in the many areas noted.
They are being set forth here to illustrate the probable
scope and nature of the executive session which is being
planned. Further discussions will be held with the SSC
staff to clarify these matters and a firmer agenda for the
proposed 11/14/75 hearing will be developed.
With respect to the proposed plan to include
representatives of CIA and the military intelligence services
along with the FBI in the proposed session of 2 and one
half hours, it was pointed out to Mr. Elliff that this would
not appear to be a very productive procedure. The CI
perspectives and responsibilities of CIA and the military
services are much more narrow and generally in a completely
different context than the CI perspectives and responsibilities
of the FBI. These differences, particularly in the short

On 10/30/75 Mr. John Elliff, SSC Staff Member,
met with Assistant Director W. R. Wannall, Intelligence
Division (INTD). Also present were Section Chiefs W. A.
Branigan (CI-1) and W. O. Cregar (CI-2) and Acting Section
Chief F. J. Cassidy (IS-3) and Unit Chief E. W. Larson,
Training Unit (IS-3). Mr. Elliff advised that the Committee
proposed to have an executive session tentatively scheduled
for the morning of Friday, 11/14/75, which wouldndeal with
foreign CI operations. In addition to representatives from
the FBI they envisioned also having present representatives
from CIA and the United States military intelligence services.
He stated that the session would be scheduled for approximately
2 and one-half hours.
During the conference the following three themes
were outlined by Mr. Elliff as the probable areas of
discussion:
1. Changes in CÍ operations during recent years
Items discussed as probably worthy of attention
were physical surveillances, the walk-in operations,
defection (recruitment-in-place), CI training programs.
Also suggested as a prime topic was the future projections
concerning administration of foreign CI operations in the
United States, i.e., new division for CI work within FBI;
separate CI service%3B or other modifications.

Enclosed is a self-explanatory letter from the
Attorney General dated 1/12/76.
Joseph Kraft, the subject of the inquiry, is the
well-known newspaper columnist and a Washington, D. C. resident,
During the past year, information contained in FBI Headquarters
files relating to Kraft has been furnished to the U. S.
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities (SSC)
pursuant to SSC requests. Kraft and his attorneys have re-
viewed the material furnished to the SSC regarding him in
accordance with an agreement between Kraft and the Attorney
General, referred to in paragraph one of the enclosure. As
noted in the enclosure, Kraft, as a result of a review of
information regarding the burglary of his residence on 9/3/69,
raised certain questions.
11
WFO should furnish FBIHQ with Xeroxes of all serials
in its files which relate to the 9/3/69 burglary except WFO
airtel and letter to the Bureau dated 9/4/69 and 10/17/69,
respectively, captioned "UNSUB; Burglary of residence of
Joseph Kraft, 3021 N. Street N. W., Washington, D. C., Loss
of silverware, 9/3/69 in excess of $5,000.00 ITSP (00:WFO)"
file number 87-17564. This material should of course include
any serials which would indicate the manner in which the
burglary was reported to WFO and how the conversation about the
burglary took place.

"On the morning of September 4, 1969,
the Metropolitan Police Department was advised
by the Washington National Airport Police that
some silverware had been found near one of the
entrances to the terminal at the Washington
National Airport.
The silverware was recovered
by the Metropolitan Police Department and
processed for latent fingerprints without
success and the items were returned to Mrs.
Kraft upon her identification of the silverware.
No suspects were developed by either the FBI
or the Metropolitan Police Department in the
investigation of the matter."
Mr. Kraft does not recall having spoken to the FBI about the
burglary. Documents provided more recently to Mr. Kraft pursuant
to the August 5, 1975, agreement do not shed any light on this
question.
The incident is curious in that the only reference to it comes
in the memorandum of July 18, 1973, discussing a press report about
the activities of John D. Erlichman. Could you have someone look
into this matter for me? The obvious questions are: What other
documents in FBI files say about the September 3, 1969, burglary?
What files of the Bureau or its Washington field office indicate
about how the conversation about the burglary took place?

In addition to the review of all files pertinent to
this inquiry, WFO should review the newspaper morgues of daily
newspapers published in Washington, D. C., at such time for
articles concerning the burglary and which may shed some
additional light on this matter.
This matter must be given expeditious attention
and results submitted by airtel to reach Bureau by
c.o.b. 1/30/76.
NOTE:
Bureau memorandum dated July 23, 1973, referred
to in enclosure and to which Kraft raised a question
sets forth the information that Kraft advised WFO on
9/4/69 of the burglary of his residence 9/3/69. Kraft
now has no recollection of having spoken to the FBI
about the burglary. Pertinent FBIHQ main case files
on Kraft (62-115682, 65-75629, 87-107157 and 105-68548)
were reviewed by Supervisor T. E. Burns in connection
with this inquiry. Such review failed to develop
required information. Review by WFO as directed within
should develop appropriate information necessary to
resolve this matter.

SUBJECT: DEMCON
As the Bureau is aware, I am gravely concerned over
the potential for serious violence occurring in Chicago during
the period of the Democratic Convention, which commences
August 26, 1968 and the days immediately preceding this
convention. Had the convention occurred within 30 days after
the President made his announcement that he was not going to
run for reelection and after the Viet Nam peace talks started
in Paris, I feel that we might not have had serious violence
as these two occurrences took much of the steam out of many of
the organizations comprising the "New Left". Their direction
at that time was primarily against President JOHNSON and
against Viet Nam and much of the steam went out of their
programs following these two announcements.
It is our observation, however, that these "New Left"
organizations have now had time to redirect their programs
and are now concentrating primarily on demonstrations and
activities against Vice President HUMPHREY, characterized
by them as the "Dump Humphrey Campaign". The fact that the
Iwar still continues in Viet Nam, has again given emphasis
to the organizations which exist on the basic theme of anti-
Viet Nam. I am thinking particularly of such organizations
as the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Viet
Nam, Students for Democratic Society, Student Mobilization
Committee to End the War in Viet Nam and the Youth International
Party (Yippies).

On August 12, 1968, USA THOMAS A.FORAN contacted
SAC, Chicago, advising that WARREN CHRISTOPHER, Deputy U.S.
Attorney General, desired to meet with the SAC, Chicago.
As a result of the above request, SAC, Chicago,
and Supervisor RICHARD L. STRAIN met briefly with Mr. WARREN
CHRISTOPHER and Mr. WES POMEROY of the U.S. Department of
Justice, Washington, D.C., in the presence of USA FORAN in
his offices.
Mr. CHRISTOPHER was most congenial and expressed
his high regard for the FBI and asked for a current evaluation
of activities in the Chicago area which could possibly affect
the Democratic National Convention (DNC) being held the last
week of August, 1968. Mr. CHRISTOPHER was advised that all
information has been previously furnished to him by letterhead
memoranda and was in his possession and he was assured all
information coming to our attention would be immediately
furnished to the Department and to the USA in Chicago. A brief
discussion of current trends followed relative to current intel-
ligence regarding the activities of anti-war and Negro militant
organizations which have proposed disruptive tactics at the DNC.
At one point in the discussion mention was made of the
fact that the Youth International Party, aka Yippies, was currently
holding talks (with the city administration in an effort to obtain
necessary park permits to have their followers live and sleep in
one of the Chicago area parks during the week of the convention and
hold a "happening" which the Yippies referred to as the "Festival
of Life." During this discussion USA FORAN confidentially advised
that when he had received the FBI's notification of the anticipated
plans on the part of the Yippies, he had contacted certain city
officials known to him and attempted to persuade them against the
issuance of such a permit in view of the known moral conduct of
such groups. USA FORAN advised he had been assured that such
permits would not be granted. He stated these permits have as yet
not been granted and that his sources have indicated no serious
consideration has been given to the request by responsible Chicago
city officials.

For the Bureau's information, Sgt. JOSEPH GRUBISIC,
Intelligence Section, Chicago PD, advised previously that he
had learned from DAVID STAHL of the Mayor's Office, Chicago,
that they had received a telephone call, a couple of days ago,
from one WES POMEROY of the U.S. Attorney General's Office,
to the effect that the Attorney General wanted the Chicago
city officials to give every consideration to the granting
of the permits requested by the Yippies.
Sgt. GRUBISIC was unable to comment on the feeling
of the city administration to this request but was of the
opinion that such permits would not be granted as requested.
Sgt. GRUBISIC based his opinion on the fact that four repre-
sentatives of the Yippies, from New York City, had gone to
the office of the Deputy Superintendent of the Chicago PD and
had requested immunity from arrest for all Yippies during the
convention for crimes around the possession of narcotics. The
Yippies stated that any arrest would cause the Yippie community
to cause large scale riots, and the blame of any riots resulting
from such arrests would fall on the Chicago PD.
These representatives of the Yippies were advised
in no uncertain terms that the laws of the City of Chicago
would be strictly enforced fairly on all persons and that no
one would be granted any immunity during this period.
The Bureau's attention is invited to the August 9,
1968, issue of the "Daily World," daily publication of the
Communist Party, USA (CP), wherein an article appeared on page
one captioned "Rallies Will Ring Demo Convention" written by
CARYL DAVIAU, current member!, CP of Illinois, in which the
reporter indicates that the National Mobilization Committee
to End the War in Vietnam, which is working around the clock to
mobilize demonstrations against the convention, has petitioned
the Justice Department to investigate the Chicago Police to
determine if there is any conspiracy to deprive "us" of our
full civil liberties..
Chicago will continue to follow these matters
closely and immediately advise the Bureau, and continue to
disseminate all information of intelligence collected to
interested agencies.
No recommendation is being made nor is Chicago
involving itself in any plans affecting the issuance of the
abovementioned park permit.

this area. I would like to utilize them specifically to work
cases in the "New Left" area, make contacts and would also
request authority where necessary to utilize them in under-
cover work under my personal supervision and guidance. They
would be specifically assigned fulltime to solicit information
from the leadership of the "New Left" concerning their plans
for demonstrations, confrontations and disruptions of the
Democratic Convention and matters relating thereto.
I am, therefore, urgently requesting that SA WILLIAM
J. DILLON, III, presently assigned to Los Angeles and SA WAYNE
F. MANIS, under transer to Anniston, Alabama Resident Agency,
be assigned on a temporary basis in Chicago for the above stated
purpose from August 15, 1968 through August 31, 1968. Both
men, while young in years in the Bureau, demonstrated outstanding
judgment and I am convinced that their assignments, as recommended
above, would prove to be most beneficial in carrying out our
responsibilities in connection with the Democratic Convention.

This will confirm telephonic contact between
SAC, Chicago, and Assistant Director N. P. CALLAHAN
on August 13, 1968.
As the Bureau is aware, the Democratic
National Convention will be held in Chicago from
August 26 - 28, 1968. Voluminous information is
being received from all offices which requires immediate
handling. In addition, tension is growing in the ghetto
areas of Chicago particularly the west side, the south
side and the near north side. Also, tension has been growing i
such Chicago suburban areas as Harvey, Chicago Heights,
East Chicago Heights and Maywood. Incidents are occurring
´every night and throughout the night requiring immediate
preparation of teletypes, letterhead memoranda and ther
communications. It is, therefore, necessary as approved
by Mr. CALLAHAN for one and on some shifts two stenographers
to be on duty from 4:00 PM to midnight and from midnight
to 8:00 AM, seven days a week through August 30, 1968.
These stenographers have been selected on a purely voluntary
basis. The authority for these special shifts will be
considered to expire close of business August 30, 1968,
and thereafter we will revert back to the regularly approved
stenographic shifts.

As the Bureau is aware, Chicago is in receipt of
information from confidential sources indicating a potential
for demonstration arising out of the "New Left" calling for
direct confrontation with the Chicago Police Department as a
diversionary tactic for a "crash-in" at the convention site.
Sources have also reported independent action on the part of
individuals to cause some form of "sabotage" activity inside
the convention itself. Information received from confidential
informants in other divisions indicates attempts on the part
of dissident young people not organizationally affiliated with
the "New Left", to hire 50 buses out of New York to bring
demonstrators to Chicago and a caravan of militant Latin
Americans to come from the Miami, Florida area to Chicago for
the specific purpose of disrupting the Democratic National
Convention.
The Chicago area activists in the Youth International
Party are currently planning a "Festival of Lights" in one of
the parks on Chicago's lakefront during the period of the
Democratic National Convention. This "Festival of Lights"
characterized by Chicago area Yippie leadership as being peaceful
to show America that there is an alternative to the "festival
of death", or the Democratic National Convention. However,
sources report that there are elements within the Youth Inter-
national Party which are calling for direct confrontation with
the Chicago Police Department during the "Festival of Lights".
There is a very definite indication that more and
more plans are being made by these groups to cause violence and
trouble and undoubtedly this will increase even more as we
approach the time of the convention. I strongly feel that we
must use every possible means at our command to insure that
the Director, the President of the United States and other pertinent
officials are furnished every possible piece of intelligence
information which we can gather from any source.
I am specifically asking for the services of two
Special Agents who proved during their assignment in Chicago that
they are expecially well qualified to handle informants and make
contacts in the "New Left" area. They proved during their
assignments in Chicago that they have the knowhow, the interest,
the dedication and the personality to be highly successful in

At 9:15 AM today, the Director telephonically
contacted me to advise that he had just been in touch
with the Vice President of the United States and had
just gotten off the phone with the Vice President's
Executive Assistant, Mr, WILLIAM CONNELL, Mr. HOOVER.
stated that the Vice President has requested that we
furnish the same type of service in connection with
the Democratic National Convention in Chicago as was
furnished to the President during the Atlantic City
Convention four years ago. This, of course, refers to
intelligence information which will be of value to
the Vice President and specifically relates to the
possibility of demonstrations, violence and related
matters. Mr. HOOVER stated that he had advised the
Vice President and Mr. CONNELL that this service
would be performed and that Mr. CONNELL should contact
me for the necessary arrangements.
Mr. HOOVER advised me that Mr. CONNELL is
presently in New York and it is not known when he will
arrive in Chicago. I advised Mr. HOOVER that his
instructions would be followed, that we had set up
appropriate arrangements so that we would be in a position
to furnish valuable intelligence and that upon Mr. CONNELL's
arrival in Chicago, I would immediately contact him
and perfect the necessary arrangements.
My secretary has been instructed to notify
all switchboard operators, complaint agents and supervisors
that any call from Mr. CONNELL should be immediately
referred to me when I am in the office or if I am not in
the office to determine where I can contact Mr. CONNELL
immediately.
