to the development of human relations. His forte is therefore
more in the field of spotting and making operational contacts
than in that of more than short-range operational development.
Subject's operational situation makes it impossible for him to
attempt recruitments. Thus, his very real achievements are not
by essence of the spectacular variety.
Subject's reporting has been satisfactory and continue to
be copious. He could, however, further improve the selectivity
of the leads provided the station and make more of an effort to
"digest" the information contained in his reports.
Although Subject has, at present, no supervisory function.
he has repeatedly requested such a responsibility. He is careful
with operational expenses and has exercised good security.
During the period under review, additional efforts have been
made to make full use of Subject's potential and integrate him
further in the work of the station component with which he works.
He is a particularly valuable asset for the Station programs;
directed against the local MHHARSH and TPFAST targets.

substantial. In a word, is it worth it? We do not yet know.
although our initial impressions are favorable.
On the fitness report itself, this rater would have preferred
an "g" rating for specific duty number one; Subject may ultimately
"g°
'deserve an "O", but it does not seem warranted at the present time.
Moreover, I believe the overall rating would more properly have
been in the higher range of the "p" category, rather than "S",
but it is of course a subjective judgment of the rating officer,
who is more intimately and directly involved with Subject on a
frequent basis.
In sum, the cover is superb, and only time will reveal to
what extent the cover requirements permit a full measure on be-
half of the Organization. We are following this aspect closely
and will be commenting upon it subsequently as we gain experience
and knowledge.

the local S&T and Commercial target. Subject's recent activity has beco
very productive indeed. Subject used the excellent potential given to him by his
cover to skillfully spot and assess access agent candidates. As Subject's oper
tional situation in Paris precludes making recruitment, the most promising of there
candidates, was placed in contact with a Station officer during social events Subject
organized. At the same time, Subject continued his efforts to develop personal rel
tionship with several ARSHers. The beginning of personal, as opposed to purely
professional, relations with a major MARSH target enabled him to obtain insight
in to the target's beliefs and personality which was the best the Station had to daze

As previous Station correspondence and fitness reports will reflect, this
offfeer has been the subject of varying evaluations and projections in recent years.
In fairness to him, borever, it is equally true that an officer under non-official
cover reflects, in the level and quality of his performance, the amount and type
of quifance, direction and push he receives from the responsible inside caso
officer. Making allowances for these variables, this offices's part record has not
been impressive; however, it is also correct to note that he has improved sub-
stantially during the latter part of the period under review, and that if the Station
can work out some fiscal arrangement which will reduce the heavy financial input

from the Organisation, his continued presence at this Station definitely
appears to be warranted for a sufficient period to reach more définite
conclusions concerning the level of sustained performance over a somewhat
longer period than that reflected by this report.
+
On balance, we are pleased that this officer has responded so well to
greater case officer direction and that he has undertaken somewhat more
aggressive efforts to expand his range of contacts in immediat e proximity
to the primary Station targets. This officer does bring many talents to bear
on his operational activity: he has absolutely fluent French, a solid and
exploitable cover, and a vast range of contacts in the local community.
Nonetheless, it will require additional time to explore these contacts In
depth, select those which appear to be operationally viable, and pursue
them actively either to the point of recruitment by another officer or elimina-
tion from further development, for whatever reason,
In sum, in spite of the recognised and commendable improvement in thia
officer's performance during the period under review, the reviewer submits
that the latter grade for specific duties 2 and 4 would more properly have
been a "P", and that the overall rating, at this point, would more accurately -
be set at a level between "P" and "S", probably closer to the former than
the latter.
This reviewing comment has been read by the officers who prepared
the Fitness Report.

increased the tempo of his activities and contacts. Many agent
prospects have been screened and contacts were established with
people of interest to several elements of the Station. Subject
particularly thorough and outstanding on specific investigations
where he utilized cover in a skillful and imaginative way. He has
improved in terms of people development but in this respect he is
still best with people in a professionally related context rather
than a contrived social context. As mentioned in the previous

which he has created and expanded his cover. I would have restricted myself to
PROFICIENT, however, in assessing his exploitation of that cover for operational

3. It is difficult to place in the proper perspective the
contribution of this senior staff agent to Paria Station operations.
On the one hand, Subject has established superb cover in the
scientific and technical field which should have afforded him
virtually unlimited access to persons of interest to us, both
Soviet and potential access agents. In evaluating the manner in
which the employee set up and managed this cover, I would tend to
agree with his comments to the fitness report on the
lead
demands on him although these comments are somewhat overdrawn.
The principal difficulty has been the time it has taken to
relate the cover potential to the specific operational require-
ments of the Station. We have not received from CASASIN as .
leads and assessment reports to persons of operational interest
in the S&T field as we think he could have produced. It may be
that the earlier listing of the project (viewed as a regional
undertaking) contributed to this.
Recently we have noted significant improvement in that wo
have received responses to requests we have made for assessment
and development of potential access agents within a cover context.
We hope, therefore, that this last year of CASASIN's stay will
be the most productive ever. It is unfortunate that the cover
must and because of the cover company's decisions over which wa
had no control.

I rarely me the written product of this explayes's efforts and know little
of his work except as I an informed of it by his supervisor in the Station. I
have the impression, however, that the msployes is responding to his supervisor's
uidases and is not by any means simply driffting along pathe indicated by his
cover work, which can be a temptation when an employes has, as is true in this
case, rather limited contact with his colleagues who work vndar official cover en
the same targets I thus concur in the evaluation on the basis of limited mowledge.

ADDENDUM, Form 45 (Fitness Report), for period March 67-March 68.
Section D
As the individual being rated, I would like to add some remarks to
those prepared by the rating officer.
The assignment I have includes managerial responsibilities which
(a) are essential to the continued existence and security of the
cover mechanism as a vehicle for operational exploitation, and
(b) are not necessarily visible to those "on the inside.
become
In the case of (a), I must engage in a constant orchestration of
the cover and the facilities it offers. This means maintaining
a managerial equilibrium to insure that cover work will not
of itself, so demanding that it negates the cover's
utility to the CS. In effect, the top officuru un riddle
managers of the cover corporation (who are not cleared and wisting)
have to be satisfied that their demands are met (or cannot be), or
else manipulated in order to neutralize or reject their demands.
After all, the cover position is to them a legitimate, normal,
workaday post in their firm. What work is done at their bidding,
it follows, must be accomplished according to the high standards
of thoroughness and accuracy which they have set.
--
In the case of (b) -- which derives from (a) and can prove to
be so demanding that the needs of the CS could no longer be served,
the incumbent is required to manage a span of human contacts at
several levels in order to preserve his cover position and enhance
its value to the CS. This means planning, directing and
managing the work of multinational, multicultural teams of
technical correspondents, as well as meetings and negotiations to
improve the [cover firm's] relations with similarly widespread
individuals at the levels of editor-in-chief, publisher, corporate
vice-president, president, and chairman of the board. These
levels are scattered not only through industry, bus have their
analogs as well in government, higher education, and professional
societies.
Having previously managed both a CS base and the principal denied-
areas operating component of a major field Station, I can report
quite honestly that my present managerial responsibilities exceed
the former despite the apparent lack of "supervisory
responsibilities" in my present position.

solidification of his cover and the expansion of his operational activity within his
cover to a point where he represents as deeply buried a staff officer as can be founvi
anyone with his past organizational background. From the point of view of the host
country authorities he appears to be completely legitimate. From the more important
point of view of his targeta, he also apparently has, been accepted, and not through a
lack of opportunity for scrutiny, for what he claims to be.
what he claims to be. He thus represents for
KUBARK an asset who has not only solid status and access cover, but also the demonstrated
capability for exploiting his cover for specific and aggressive operational undertakinga.
As has been stated in past fitness reports, his present capability directly and openly
to approach operational targets through the vehicle of his cover is the result of his own
efforts, in which he has devoted a tremendous amount of work not only to establish and
enhance the foundations of the cover, which requires a considerable amount of work for
the cover company, but to devise and exploit ways and reans by which the cover activity
may be applied directly to operational tasks and programs. In adultion to operational
activity in his country of assignment, he has also been used in Hq-directed activity in
other countries, usually involving direct contact with target individuals, and in addi-
tion he has contributed greatly to the acquisition of operational information for the
use of Has components in their overall approach to Soviet scientific and technical tar-
gets.
It would be difficult to fault this employee with respect to energy, professional
skills, and mental capacity. He la a keen student of his operational environment and
very skillful in analyzing the possibilities it offers for application toward operational
objectives. He shows considerable resourcefullness in devising logical and credible.

cover and to ensure the maximum exploitation of his contacts with target organi-

excellent.
'
Prom the point of view of supervision, this employee in his present position re-
quires guidance only insofar as to identify specific targets and for him to protect
himself in situations where he does not have, by virtue of his not having access to
official files, specialized information. Otherwise, he requires no supervision
other than the periodic provision of policy and operational directives.
This employee has always been conscious and punctillious in his preparation of
operational and administrative reports, including financial accountings, and his
reporting in general, despite the burdens imposed by the necessity for minimizing
the risks inherent in the lack of access to classified storage, leaves nothing to
· be desired.
Other than the funds for operational activities, this employee currently has no
responsibility for the programming and use of personnel, space, equipment, and
Pada.
with res, not to doileation to his job, this employee has practically speaking
single-handedly built his present cover/operational position despite a number of
negative factors innerent to his situation such as relative isolation, meager oppor-
tunity for contact with his professional group, and expensive area of assignment,
and an exposed cover situation where the necessity for living cover is compounded
by the necessity of avoiding mistakes which might jeopardise cover. His dedication
to and enthusiasm for accepting the challenge of this assignment, and his willingness
to continue on in it, deserve particular mention, particularly since he would per-
haps Justifiably feel that his present assignment may leave him outside the main-
stream of competitive organisation progression..
This employee's health and family situations leave nothing to be desired, as his
proven mobility in the execution of operational assignments attests.
It should further be noted that with respect to the problem endemic to deep-cover
assignments of allocation of time between cover work and operational activity, this
employee comes very close to the happy norm of making cover work complement opera-
tional work, and making operational work contribute where possible to the enhance-
ment of cover.
While this employee's assignment to date has essentially been a cha-san show, it
1a recer ended that serious consideration be given to expanding the operational com
plex which he has created in order to capitalize on his experience, the work he has
put in to date, and his own management capabilities.

NARRATIVE COMMENTS.
Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective their relationship to
overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment
on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain rotings given in Section 8 to provide best
basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisorý duties must be described, if
applicable.
This employee combines the relatively rare combination of senior and broadly
experienced Intelligence offloor under working cover, providing both long-term status
in his country of residence (and in Europe in general) and access for a variety of
operational functions, including spotting, assessing, contact with Soviet bloa
nationals of specific interest, investirative monsures; assessment in depth of
ostensibly cover-company hired persons, and attendance at a broad range of national
and international specialized meetings. Development of the capability operationally
to exploit his cover has been the achievement of the employee himself. In so doing
he has at the same time achieved genuine acceptance by his cover company associates
(most of whom are unwitting) and his colleagues in his cover profession and related
professions.
In undertaking operational tasks tals employee has consistantly shown Liftiative
imagination, security conscioustous, and application of both operational and substan-
tive background to the problem at hand. He has put a conscious effort into improving
his already excellent command of the French language, and his grasp of a variety of
specialized scientific and technical fields has been achieved basically as a result
of his own efforts.
His management of operational reporting, finances, and the administrative
problems. connected with his cover status has been exemplary...
It should be noted that during the reporting period, this employee has not had
the benefit at all times of specific pinpointed operational direction. As of the end
of the raporting period, Headquarters assumed control of his activities against.

NARRATIVE COMMENTS
:
11
The assignment of this employee to the field under non-official cover
was designed to compensate for the loss of an employee in an official cover
slot which was cut from the Station's ODACID allotment of personnel positions.
During the reporting period this employee has accomplished with success
the convincing establishment of his cover in a complex milieu, and has been
accepted as legitimate by his professional colleagues, the persons whom hë.
meets under cover, and the French authorities. It should be noted that his
ability to assume his cover has been largely the result of his own efforts
over a period of years to acquire and maintain a familiarity with the general
scientific field.
During the reporting period he has developed a wide circle of contacts
in the scientific and journalistic fields and applies a long background in
a variety of assignments in KUDOVE to the determination and assessment of
operational potential among these contacts. At the same time his cover
organization, in which only four persons are witting of his actual status,
has shown itself to be more than satisfied with his performance of his cover
duties.
This employes requires a minimum of detailed operational supervision;
it is necessary in specific cases only to indicate the operational or infor-
mational objectives.
From the point of view of administrative support, his attention to
detail and meticulousness reduce the problems of his support by the Station
to a minimum.
This employee uses the French language continuously, and his facility
is such as to permit him to handle himself excellently in a broad range of
complex technical subjects. He has in addition undertaken specialized French
language training to develop this capability further. His operational re-
porting is excellent both with regard to clarity and pertinence.
In the immediate future he will be assigned case work, for the most
part in fields where it will complement, and be complemented by, his in-
dependent operational activities and cover work.

MEMORANDUM FOR:
Director of Personnel
VIA:
FROM:
SUBJECT:
Deputy Director for Operations
Chief, European Division
Request for Extension of the Services of
Thomas B. CASASIN (P), Retired Annuitant,
under a Memorandum of Oral Commitment
=
1.
Action Requested: Your approval is requested to
extend the services of Thomas B. CASASIN (P) under a Memoran-
dum of Oral Commitment for the period 1 July 1975 to 31 December
1977. The only compensation to CASASIN would be money equiva-
lent to shipment costs for a maximum of 1,000 pounds of personal
effects from Paris, France, to the United States. Since CASASIN
is an Independent Contractor, the amount of money given CASASIN
will be considered taxable income for tax year 1977.
-
2. Basic Data and Background: CASASIN, born 20 January
1924, has been employed by the Agency since 1949. Twelve years
of this period were spent as a Staff Employee, seven of which
were at Headquarters and five years, 1955-1960, were spent in
Tokyo. In 1962 CASASIN was assigned to Paris under nonofficial
cover as a Staff Agent. In 1972 he was converted to Career
Associate status to coincide with his cover employment with
UNESCO, a position he attained on his own initiative. CASASIN
retired as a GS-15, Step 10, on 30 June 1974 and with proper
Headquarters approvals was utilized by Paris Station as an Inde-
pendent Contractor, effective 1 July 1974. His compensation was
in accordance with the 90 percent provision of HR 20-13 a(1)
(c) (1).
3. Staff Position: Due to his growing employment involve-
ment at UNESCO, CASASIN requested, and the Paris Station agreed,
not to renew his written Independent Contract, due for renewal
1 July 1975. However, since CASASIN is willing to meet informally

Subject is an exceedingly well-equipped operations officer. He is mature,
intelligent, has a thorough background in operations in his area and the ability
to grow in his job. His operational planning and execution is usually impeccable.
He has the loyalty of his subordinates and the respect of his equals and super-
visors. He is particularly effective in dealing in the liaison field where his
good sense and disinterest in "fighting the problem produces a maximum of
cooperation and good will. If he has any minor fault as a supervisor, it is not
in impatience with his subordinates, as reflected in previous evaluations, but
in an occasional unvillingness to say no to them.

During the partod covered by this report he has displayed great industry and
devotion to duty in a variety of circumstanoso and achieved notable results
in production and in the creation of both short and long-term assets for his
unit. On the debit side I would say that he is somewhat too businesslike in
many personal situations to the point of beding almost tumourless. This, howper

in terms of mental capacity, psychological bent and affinity for the things.

ability among other natural aptitudes. On the debit side and measured against

Chief, Mr. Richardson has performed his duties, taken as a whole, in a superior manner.
His timely and efficient preparation of intelligence annexes, logistic and fiscal require-
ments and reports has been particularly outstanding. During three to four months of the
past year, Mr. Richardson has acted as Branch Chief. The review of Branch operations under
Mr. Richardson's direction, during the writer's absence, indicated his complete competence
in supervising Branch activities. His supervision of the planning and preparation for ap
proval of basic plans and projects of the seven (7) desk chiefs has been superior. Mr.
Richardson also participated in the plarming and dispatch of a difficult operational mis-
sion, acting in the capacity of Senior Case Officer. On this mission his liaison with
representatives of one of the Military Services was conducted in a manner which enhanced
cooperation between that S ice and this Agency.

completed fifteen years of service with the Organization, your right to this election vests upon
your designation as a participant and must be exercised immediately.

under the Civil Service Retirement System. Once your election has been made, you do not
have the privilege of changing it at some later date.

IN ONAT RESPECT IS THIS PERSON
PERFORMANCETON PRESENT JOB MOST NOTICEABLY GOOD OR OUTSTANDING!
+
Mr. Richardson's performance was noticeably outstanding with respect to his thorough know-
ledge of overy activity of the Branch. He was in position to assume direction of Branch
activities at any time.
at any time. He also kept himself thoroughly briefed on Division policies and
planning in order to give timely instruction and guidance to the Branch overseas stations.
13. ON WHAT ASPECT OF PERFORMANCE SHOULD THIS PERSON CONCENTRATE EFFORT, FOR SELF ´EMPROVEMENT?.
Mr. Richardson has a very thorough background in two (2) languages, French and Japanese. Ho
would benefit substantially by learning the Russian language. He is meticulous with res-
pect to his attention to details, sometimes to the point of concealing the broader picture
from his view. It would bo well for Mr. Pichardson to direct his attention to the broad
scope of Branch activities rather than to concentrate on its details.
14. COMMENT ON-THIS PERSON'S ABILITY TO HANDLE GREATER RESPONSIBILITIES NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.
Mr. Richardson is fully qualified to assume the duties of the chief SK Division
chief SE Division representa
tive at a field station. In order to assume this responsibility in the most efficient
manner, it is recommended that Mr. Richardson serve a minimum period of time of approximat.c+
ly six (6) months as the assistant to the present chief of the field station.
15 ARE THERE OTHER DUTIES WHICH BETTER SUIT THIS PERSON'S QUALIFICATIONS? (Recommand appropriate
possible.)
Inmont,
Mr. Richardson could serve effectively in a staff function for either F1 or PP activities.
This does not mean, however, that his prosent duties are not better suited to his qualif-
cations.
16. WHAT TRAINING OR ROTATION DO YOU RECOMMEND FOR THIS PERSON?
Mr. Richardson has already been recommended for overseas assignment in the Far East during
the past year.
He has area knowledge and command of the Japanese language, having served
in Japan previously with the United States Army. His duties at Houdquaters nave been so
pressing that his departure for overseas assignment is being delayed until an adequate
replacement ruy be trained.

Technical Writers! Institute; certificate awarded
Purpose: to provide a forum where technical writers from industry and government
can meet to discuss and practice writing techniques under the supervision of exper-
ienced teachers. Many of the instructors have worked closely with industry as con-
sultanta on special writing problems and trainin courses for technical writing.
All of them háva published in the field of technical writing.

YOUR OPINION OF THE PROGRAM (Explain strengths and weak na
This was an excellent combination of classroom prescrtations and writing laborn-
tories. Almost all guest speakers had a useful message to deliver. The writing
encouragod is of the tight-language, puro English variety, in the three categories
of informative, directive, and persuasive writing. The schedule was full, although
I believe it could have been fuller. The five 2 hour workshops should be expanded
to three-hour sessions. The contact with representatives of industry was especially
useful for cross-fortilisation purposés,
3. EXPLAIN TRAINING OBJECTIVES AND WHETHER THEY WERE MET
Your our purposes, the training objectives were (a) to see that our writing tech-
niques in the reporting field compare favorably with those in industry, (b) to
meet and become known by persons throughout the nation in the technical writing
field, and (c) to learn new techniques in the field of communicating technical,
scientific and engineering concepts, processes, and general information. All
three objectives were met. I recommend that officers from /Reports and SR/
Requirements-Targets, as well as analysts from SR 6, be paradited the opportunity
to attend this same institute in future years. It is well worth the effort.

COURSE OBJECTIVES

CONTENT AND METHODS
The Management Course is designed to familiarize senior line and
staff managers with both the theory and the practical problems of
management in CIA. The underlying assumption of the course is that
management development is a process of growth on the job. The course,
however, enables the participants to examine their job activities in
an environment where, guided by the instructors, they can critically
examine their own actions, exchange ideas with managers from other
components, and develop an understanding of the complex relationships
that exist among the people, the pattern of organization, and the
purposes of the Agency. The course approaches the problems of
management in the Agency by discussing the formal and informal structures,
concepts of leadership and communication, the problems of personnel
management, and theories of planning and controlling. These subjects
are related as closely as possible to the activities of the class members.
The content of the course is developed through lectures, case and
group discussions, filmed presentations, and problem-solving exercises.
ACHIEVEMENT RECORD
This is a certificate of attendance only. No attempt was made to
evaluate student achievement in this course.

The general aim of this course is to provide a thorough grounding for the
student who has previously had either a reading course in French or an insufficient.
introduction to the language. The major objectives of this phase of the course are
to develop an ability: (1) to distinguish and pronounce satisfactorily all the
sounds of the language; (2) to use effectively a modest stock of French sentences
and expressionis; (3) to comprehend normal-speed spoken French in a variety of
everyday non-technical situations; (4) to begin to read and write basic French,
applying the spoken vocabulary and grammatical material previously learned.
Classes are held 2 hours per day, 5 days a week, requiring a minimum of 10 hours
of preparation por week.
week. To receive the maximum benefit from this course each
student should plan to devote at least two-thirds of the class preparation time
doing drill in the language laboratory.
ACHILVEMENT RECORD
Student progress is evaluated primarily on oral recitation in the form of drills
and free conversation based on memorized material. In addition, several tests are
given during the course. This student's rating is indicated by the asterisk.

Mrs. Richardson was definitely a superior student. Her pronunciation was
excellent and she had a solid command of the structure of trench. She was
somewhat hesitant in new language situations, but she more than made up for
this through diligent and profitable laboratory and home preparation.

The Countorespionage Course is a specialised course of three weeks'
duration designed to expose the student to CS principles and practices and
to indoctrinatə him therein. The course is conducted on a seminar, round-
table basis. Emphasis is placed on student participation during staff and
guest lectures. Ample time is allotted for reading the extensive material
provided.
Each student is required, starting mid-way in the second week, to give.
& presentation before the clase. This hour-long presentation is based on
a problem assignment given the student by the staff. Exception is rude
where students have the field or headquarters experience in CE or a related
field; such a student is permitted to give a cna-hour lecture busod on
specific experience. The "canned" problems are selected to tost students!

1. Mr. Richardson ranked first in a strong group. He applied
himself effectively throughout the course. His seminar contributions
aided materially. He drew freely on a sound operational background
and was by all odds the top student.
2. Student Presentation: Mr. Richardson presented a case with
which he was familiar from his own experience. It was a first-rate
performance. The material was very well organized and crisply pro-
sented. So effective in fact, that Mr. Richardson will be called
upon to give the same discussion in subsequent CE courses.
3. In my opinion Mr. Richardson is fully qualified to act as
senior CE officer.

Employee should be relatively free to travel on short trips to nearby
countries of Western and Middle Europe. Times and intervals will
probably be dictated by the Paris Station.
(4) Special Aroups the employee should be able to contact
Although it is not essential, it would be desirable if the employee's
cover permitted him to initiate and maintain contacts in the scientific,
technological, commercial and engineering fields.
(5) Income directly attributable to cover should be in the range of $10,000
per annum, with supplementary income attributable to commissions,
retainers, piece work fees, personal resources, etc.
(6) Employee should be able to devote upward of 30 hours per week to
operational duties.
(7) Communications channela desired
Communications will be (a) directly with Station; (b) indirectly with
Station via dead-drop, S/W, accommodation addresses, cut-outs, or any
combination of these, or (c) in unusual circumstances via Headquarters
or third country points. It is not desired that the cover facility
provide an operational communication channel.
(8) Cover Suggestions
Suitable covers might includes technical publication representative,
correspondent, or editor; book or manuscript agent or publisher's
representative; corporation, service, or management consultant's
representative; prestige or representational agent for large firm,
service, institute, or association. The cover vis-a-vis the target
is less important than the status afforded by the cover to the eyes
of the host government, 1.e., a reason for being there.

connections. Acquaintance is former staffer, discreet, and who wante
to protect his own reputation and status locally.

to continue in a non-official cover capecity, or convert to the most
appropriate official cover dictated by operational and administrative-
planning needs.

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT.
SUBJECT
PERIOD COVERED:
Thomas B. CASASIN
January – June 1974
Although I have been the Station case officer for Subject
only since January 1974, I have been acquainted with his performance
for the Station for the past 5 1/2 years through my assignment in
the French Branch at Headquarters and, for the past 2 1/2 years,
as the Station officer responsible for UNCAÍRD operations. I
have always considered CASASIN to be a highly skilled, experienced
senior case officer thoroughly devoted to the work of BKHERALD.
He is becoming increasingly effective in his present cover position
at UNCAIRD, operating against both Soviet and PRC targets, and I
am delighted that he has agreed to continue his cooperation with
the Station as a field agent following his retirement from
-
1
BKHERALD effective 30 June 1974. CASASIN can look back with pride
over his years of service with BKHERALD but he can also look
forward to additional years of highly useful, productive work for
Paris Station.
CASASIN's attitude can best be summed up by a comment on my
first operational meeting with him following his official retire-
ment. He instinctively went immediately to a discussion of
operations, not of retirement. I am confident that CASASIN will
continue to be a highly motivated, effective asset of Paris Station,
and I wish him well.

SPECIAL NOTE,
Fitness Reports must be prepared with due regard for security considerations. For example, in the case of administrative and support
personnel and others whose duties do not in themselves reveal sources of information and methods of operation, it is normally expected
that a complete and realistic statement of specific duties may be reported in Section B. However, the nature, source, purpose or dispo
sition of information or operations will not be included. On the other hand, the description of specific duties of certain other em-
ployees may jeopardize security and should not be fully reported on this form. In these cases, general statements of specific duties
will be included in Section B indicating the level of responsibility.
INSTRUCTIONS
The following items of the Fitness Report will NOT be completed by field personnel.

SECTION
J
The attached Memorandum in Lieu of a Fitness Report should
be read in conjunction with the NOC Status Report on Subject for
the period ending 31 March 1974; these reports overlap somewhat in
the period covered. As
As has been indicated by both Russell N
SKOGSBERG who prepared Section I, and George T. HEMSLEY, who
prepared Section III of the NOC Status Report, Subject is an impressive
officer who has developed superb cover for himself but who has been
only reasonably effective in identifying, developing and turning
over þuseful access agents to the Station. While endorsing the
general thrust of the Memorandum in Lieu of a Fitness Report, the
undersigned also feels that Subject should bring a sharper focus
to bear on developing in-depth relationships with those persons
who have the potential of becoming quality access agents to
priority targets. Subject meets and knows many people in his
milieu, including Sovicts; he reports in considerable volume on
these contacts. We encourage him to concentrate on a few of
these contacts and to plumb them to their depths. The under-
signed joins SKOGSBERG in wishing Subject well and in paying.
recognition to his motivation and his attitude.
Subject's Specific Duties remained essentially as described
in his previous Fitness Report (for the pedod 1 January. - 31 December
1973). I would rate him on these Specific Duties as he was
previously rated.

Fitness Reports must be prepared with due regard for security considerations. For example, in the case of administrative and support
personnel and others whose duties do not in themselves reveal sources of information and methods of operation, it is normally expected
that a complete and realistic statement of specific duties may be reported in Section 8. However, the nature, source, purpose or dispo
sition of information or operations will not be included. On the other hand, the position titles and description of specific duties of
certain other employees may jeopardize security and should not be fully reported on this form. In these cases, general statements of
specific duties will be included in Section B indicating the level of responsibility.

NOCAD/MB REVIEWING OFFICER COMMENTS
Devthe fact.
Whether Specific Duty No. 1 is rated "O" (as by the
Station rator and reviewer) or "S" (as by the EUR Division
reviewer)
remains that CASASIN is melding his
overt life and operational activity against a primary
Station target with a degree of success not often achieved
by Agency officers.
CASASIN's response to requirements based in NOCAD
administrative and managerial responsibilities has been
prompt and efficient; in this additional specific duty we
rate his performance "Strong".
In view of his initiative and competence in a demanding
and sensitive NOC assignment, NOCAD agrees with CASASIN's
overall performance rating of "Strong".

complete and literate. Despite his relative isolation as a NOC, he is
well aware of priority objectives, concentrates his efforts in these areas
and does not waste time on operationally marginal activities.
As is normal in a NOC situation, subject has no supervisory duties with
BKHERALD personnel but his cover job provides supervisory responsibility
Subject is meticulous in presentation of financial accountings and his
operational expenses are, modest. There are no administrative problems.

level; in point of fact, it would, in the writer's opinion, merit a solid "S",
but no more. Recognizing that such ratings are perforce subjective, and
that the rating officer has a closer, almost daily experience factor,
nonetheless, the reviewer simply does not believe that the written record of
the NOC's accomplishments on the specific targets will support an "0"
rating at this time. Even accepting the limitations which the cover
situation imposes upon the NOC, he has still not performed in a manner
which would correspond to the literal definition of "0".
= =
Other than this divergency, the reviewer shares the laudatory comments
set forth in the narrative on this NOC. He is all the things the rater has
stated and more: highly intelligent, versatile, linguistically extremely
well qualified, and professionally experienced in his cover role. He has
begun very well to utilize this new cover position on the Organization's
behalf, and it is quite accurate to note that the NOC landed this particular
pluh (in terms of competition for the cover vacancy) solely on the basis of
his own demonstrated talents in the cover context.
In sun, this is an experienced, effective NOC, whose no cover afford, him
an expanded natural access to a host of the Station's primary targets; he has
begun to exploit this access in a sound, logical fashion, and the period ahead
should further document the utility of his key situation to our operational
programs. In fairness to all concerned, it is simply too early in this new
position to attempt a definitive judgment of the depth of access which can be
derived from it.
Comments by Chief, EUR France:
Although concurring with an overall rating of "S", I consider the "0"
ratings for specific duties numbers one and two to be somewhat high and I recommend
an "S" for both. Casasin certainly has maintained his cover and we anticipate
he will be able to preserve it in his new job. He has just begun to initiate
contacts with Soviet personnel of operational interest and it remains to be seen
how effectively Casasin can exploit this situation,

cost of this activity. This cover fob was possible because of subject's extens

During the period under review, this BOC moved into a highly sensitive but
potentially very valuable new cover situation, in which he has infinitely
greater access to Soviet and Chinese targets. The NOC is also superbly equipped
to handle this new position, by virtue of previous experience, linguistic
competence and substantive knowledge of the field of endeavor.
Be should, in.
our judgment, do a first-class job, both for the cover employer, and for the
Organization as well.

officials. The objective is more first hand reporting by Subject
Soviet officials and assessment reports on several of his co-workers
who can be selected and recruited (based on his asses.ment reports)
by other case officers to serve as access agents to Soviet officials.
+
Despite long service as an NOC, Subject's knowledge of and
responsiveness to Organization priorities and requirements has not
weakened. He concentrates on priority targets and his operational
reporting is complete, on target and highly literate.
As is normal in an NCC position, Subject has no supervisory
Cuties over Organization personnel although his cover job does
include supervisory responsibilities. Subject is meticulous in his
presentation of financial accountings and his operational expenses
are modest. There are no administrative problems related to this
project.

During the period covered by this report, Subject has settled into
his new cover job as an upper-level executive in an international
organization. This salary offsets approximately 40% of the cost of
maintaining this NOC in Paris. His cover is, however, excellent for
other than financial reasons: Subject's experience and skills are such
that he is admirably qualified to perform the job and is doing out-
standing work in the eyes of his peers and supervisors, all of whom are
unwitting. More importantly, it places him in a situation where he has
normal, daily contact with numerous Soviet officials and by skillful use
of his cover job he concocts logical reasons for contacting Chinese
officials to whom he does not have natural access. In additim to
direct contact to target individuals, Subject uses his position to spot
and assess co-workers having access to Station targets. ·
•
The area of Subject's performance most in need of strengthening is
follow-up development of operational targets, His cover situation is
Comewhat unique for a NOC in that It puts him in daily contact with his
priority target group: Soviet officials and other potential agents
having direct access to Soviet officials. This access is not fully
exploited. He should make a concerted effort to expand social and/or
business contacts with the four or five Soviet officials who work in
close proximity to him and to seek out and assess eight or ten third

/s/ Oleg N. Selsky
for Joe Irl Saltsman
I concur with the supervisor's letter ratings and with the substance
of his narrative comments. Put as simply as possible, Subject has done
an outstanding job in establishing superb access cover; it now remains
for him and the Station to exploit it operationally. On the basis of
his ability during the reporting period to establish meaningful
relationships with target Soviets or to spot and assess leads to
potential agents who can, Subject's retention is this assignment would
not be justified in terms of costs. The 40% rebate does make this effort
entirely defensible, however, but Subject should understand that we
expect more concrete results now that his cover position has been
solidified.

SECTION C. NARRATIVE (continued)
It has been noted in past fitness reports that subject was weak in
long-range, operational development of a target. The ease and
probable success of an extended development
extended development is a function of the
personalities involved. During this reporting period subject has
conducted a sustained development of an MHHARSHER despite their
different ages and divergent personalities thus demonstrating
improvement in this area.
I
It some times appears that subject's reporting could be more
precise and more closely attuned to BKTRUST objectives. This is
probably the result of time limitations, and the NOC officer's knowledge
of BKTRUST needa is lessened by his relative isolation.
As is normal in a NOC situation, subject has no supervisory duties
with BKTRUST personnel. His cover job provided supervisory
responsibility. Subject is meticulous in presentation of financial
accountings and his operational expenses are modest.

Section 3 Comments by. Reviewing Official
:

1
The career of this NOC officer has reached a crucial
juncture; if, as we currently anticipate, he succeeds in
landing the position for which he appears to have the inside
track, he will gain access to an institution and its employees
which could prove to be invaluable. His new function will per-
mit the widest possible access to a variety of targets, and with
careful guidance, his utility as a spotter and assessor should
improve very substantially.
-
.
The report notes that this officer has conducted a lengthy
dialogue with an MHHARSH target; it is quite accurate that our
NOC has handled himself well in a situation where disparity in
age and background renders the relationship somewhat incongruous.
Nonetheless, accuracy requires that we record that the NOC's
interlocutor has obviously not maintained this ongoing relation-
ship solely for altruistic motives, and has, in point of fact,
on one occasion suggested that the NOC might wish to "help" him
in the preparation of restricted distribution reports on the
local situation, even though the particular topic was in itself
totally innocuous. For these reasons we continue to monitor
this relationship with great care, particularly since we simply
cannot assess its longer range viability and the direction it
is likely to take.
In sum, the NOC has done the best he could under somewhat
trying circumstances, exacerbated by the severe economic problems
of his erstwhile employer, which led to the NOC's being separated
from that position at the end of last year. Through his own
efforts, the NOC learned of the vacancy for which he has applied,
and by assiduous and discriminating manipulation of his extensive
connections on the local scene, has managed to maneuver himself
into becoming the leading candidate for the post. If he is
accepted for this position, his value to the Organization will
unquestionably increase by a quantum leap, and we are consequently
optimistic concerning his future ability to make an impressive
contribution to Organizational goals on the local scene.

During the period covered by this report subject's job with a scientific
publication was terminated for economy reasons. He has now, by his
own efforts and with no BKTRUST help, obtained a similar position (
of mid-March the contract has not been signed but it is almost certain
that he has the job) with an international organization. The job is
professional level with a salary that will offset approximately 40% of the
total cost of this activity. His French fluency and background in scientific
journalism were instrumental in obtaining this job. - Subject's operational
security is good and all indications are that his cover security is superb.

4
Despite a full time cover job, and completely unwitting employer, subject
has maintained a high output for BKTRUST. He has maintained trequent
and meaningful contact with two MHHARSH nationals in Paris and with an
MHHARSH couple in another European city. The flow of spotting reparts
is equal in number and quality to those produced when his cover work was
less demanding. One person spotted and assessed by subject was
successfully recruited by an "inside" case officer. Subject's cover situation
prêcludes the possibility of his recruiting.

with three local MHHARSH officials and initiated contact with three
others. He also continued to search for new leads to personalities in

The Station submitted comments on subject officer recently in OF?T-

on his own merits, acquired a solid and potentially highly useful
cover employment, However, this new employment will demand a very
substantial amount of time and energy from Subject, and the unanswer-
able question at the moment relates to his availability for Organiza-
tional tasks. We shall need additional time and careful working with
this officer to determine the answer, since the fiscal outlay from the
